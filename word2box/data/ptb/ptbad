 the justice department has revised certain internal guidelines and <unk> others in a move that could restrict the use of criminal racketeering charges against white-collar defendants 
 the most significant changes in department policy are new requirements that federal prosecutors avoid <unk> the normal business functions of companies charged under the racketeering law a senior department official said 
 another important revision of department policy is a new guideline warning prosecutors not to take steps that would harm innocent third parties in a case brought under the racketeering law the official david runkel said 
 the department distributed the revisions and <unk> to u.s. attorneys around the country this summer as part of a routine process of <unk> prosecutorial guidelines mr. runkel said 
 the changes apply to prosecutions brought under the <unk> influenced and corrupt organizations law

 the rico law has come under criticism from some defendants and defense lawyers

 that means that if the <unk> deals with one part of the business you do n't attempt to seize the whole business you attempt to seize assets related to the crime he explained 
 in general the thrust of the department 's <unk> is to encourage prosecutors to limit pretrial asset seizures if there are less <unk> means of protecting assets the government may subsequently be able to seize after a conviction mr. runkel said 
 it was the kind of <unk> rarely seen within the congress let alone within the same party 
 sen. alan cranston <unk> over to the house side of capitol hill a few days ago and <unk> his testimony to fellow democrat rep. henry gonzalez 
 it was offered as an expression of cooperation to mr. gonzalez who is investigating the $ N billion failure of lincoln savings & loan association 
 but instead of thanks sen. cranston was treated with cool <unk> 
 every witness receives a formal subpoena rep. gonzalez told him 
 seldom have house hearings caused so much <unk> in the senate where california sen. cranston and four other senators were already <unk> in the glare of unfavorable publicity over the alleged <unk> of lincoln by their friend and political <unk> charles keating jr. principal <unk> of lincoln 's parent company american continental corp. of phoenix <unk> 
 at the first day of the house banking committee 's hearings last week william seidman chairman of the resolution trust corp. the federal agency created to sell sick thrifts said the agency is investigating whether lincoln made illegal political contributions 
 mr. keating arranged nearly $ N million in donations to sen. cranston and his various political causes and hundreds of thousands more to other lawmakers 
 future witnesses include a former federal s&l regulator who has accused the five senators of attempting to <unk> the regulatory process by <unk> on behalf of mr. keating 
 unlike many lawmakers chairman gonzalez says he considers <unk> with regulators to be improper 
 when you reach a point where a <unk> body is trying to shape administrative decisions then that 's a <unk> in my book the texas <unk> says 
 and he has attached himself to the lincoln story <unk> 
 unless the questions are answered i will keep on going 
 lawmakers often are reluctant to <unk> colleagues even those of opposing political parties 
 in the recent housing and urban development department scandal for example rep. thomas <unk> the california democrat who led the hearings <unk> through embarrassing disclosures about hud grants secured by sen. <unk> <unk> a new york republican 
 but chairman gonzalez is a genuine <unk> 
 he comes from the same political line as wright <unk> a <unk> texas <unk> who <unk> the banking committee until N 
 mr. gonzalez is also a <unk> for ethical standards who refuses to accept <unk> and who believes in conducting official business in the open 
 early in his political career as a city <unk> in san antonio he walked out of a meeting when political supporters asked that the police chief be replaced <unk> the <unk> affair publicly as a <unk> meeting 
 the immediate target of rep. gonzalez 's inquiry is danny wall chairman of the office of thrift supervision 
 as the principal regulator of the thrift industry mr. wall delayed <unk> lincoln s&l for more than two years after his staff told him that the california thrift was insolvent and that potential losses to taxpayers were growing rapidly 
 rep. gonzalez seems <unk> to <unk> out at mr. wall when hearings resume thursday with testimony by two federal regulators from san francisco william black and mike <unk> 
 mr. wall relieved them of responsibility for <unk> lincoln in N 
 mr. gonzalez expressed concern over a report that the two had been summoned to washington by mr. wall last week to discuss their testimony in advance 
 i think he is trying to improperly influence a witness and by god i 'm not going to <unk> it he says 
 mr. wall however is a <unk> child of the senate and former staff director of its banking committee 
 an inquiry into his handling of lincoln s&l inevitably will drag in sen. cranston and the four others sens. dennis <unk> d. ariz. john <unk> r. ariz. john glenn d. ohio and donald <unk> d. mich 
 they all attended a meeting in april N questioning why a federal audit of lincoln s&l had dragged on for two years 
 i 'm certain that in the course of the hearings the names of the senators will be brought out mr. gonzalez says 
 this is raising <unk> 
 when i first got a <unk> at the witness list i could n't believe that they were going to go ahead and do this says michael <unk> director of congress watch a consumer group 
 there are some witnesses who will be forced to testify about their meetings with senators 
 and a democratic aide to a banking committee member remarks i too am <unk> by it because gonzalez has certainly placed a lot of democratic senators in a very bad position 
 all the senators say they merely were trying to ensure fairness for a <unk> 
 mr. keating lives in phoenix and the california thrift 's parent is an <unk> corporation with holdings in michigan 
 chairman gonzalez <unk> <unk> for sen. <unk> his counterpart as chairman of the senate banking committee 
 he 's <unk> he 's good and i know he 's an honest man the <unk> says 
 but at the same time mr. gonzalez has n't forgotten a confrontation over mr. wall during house-senate negotiations over s&l bailout legislation during the summer 
 the senate negotiators included sens. cranston and <unk> and mr. wall 's principal sponsor republican sen. <unk> <unk> of utah 
 they were willing to trade important provisions in the bailout legislation to preserve mr. wall 's job and to avoid a <unk> hearing in which he would be called upon to testify about lincoln s&l 
 most <unk> the senate traded away the bush administration 's controversial plan to finance the bailout which was partly <unk> later 
 at the time mr. gonzalez said several senators told him that they could get some <unk> out of the way if there could be some understanding on <unk> 's insistence on wall 
 now mr. gonzalez is holding the equivalent of <unk> hearings anyway under the <unk> of the lincoln investigation 
 in a way that 's what this is mr. gonzalez concedes 
 even some house banking committee members could suffer from the fallout 
 mr. keating raised $ N for rep. doug <unk> 's N re-election campaign while the georgia democrat was taking his side against regulators who wanted to curb risky investments and wholesale deposit <unk> 
 he recently voted present when the committee authorized a subpoena to <unk> mr. keating to testify then changed his vote to yes 
 but the chairman 's supporters have the upper hand as federal regulators press a $ N billion fraud suit against mr. keating and others 
 rep. jim <unk> r. iowa says the lincoln s&l affair is the biggest bank <unk> in history and adds the great question that remains to be resolved is whether we have a congressional <unk> in the making 
 a witness set to testify on thursday was quoted in a news report over the weekend as saying lincoln <unk> campaign contributions illegally 
 but the witness william <unk> california 's chief state thrift regulator denies saying that 
 i do n't know whether it was done properly or not because i 'm not a lawyer he said in a telephone interview yesterday 
 but he said he is prepared to testify that executives of lincoln and its parent corporation got unusually high salaries and frequent calls <unk> them to make specific contributions 
 the committee also has summoned mr. wall 's predecessor edwin gray 
 he has characterized the five senators ' roles as <unk> to an attempt to <unk> the regulatory process and he is n't expected to back down even though the five senators have disputed his account of a N meeting

 ms. volokh quit her job to remove herself from the public eye 
 the wait was <unk> 
 before granting ms. volokh 's parents a visa the government required her mother to obtain permission from her first husband whom she had <unk> N years earlier 
 mr. volokh was fired from his job and had to endure hours of organized <unk> abuse from his <unk> accusations of sabotage and <unk> activities

 william d. <unk> president of the <unk> trade and economic council has a warning for u.s. companies trying to do business in the soviet union 
 it 's an extremely complex market and you have to be prepared to make a big commitment mr. <unk> says 
 we are not trying to encourage everyone 
 <unk> by such words of caution corporate america is <unk> to moscow <unk> by a huge <unk> market and mikhail gorbachev 's attempt to overhaul the soviet economy 
 doing business with the russians once the pursuit of a handful of <unk> veterans has become the goal of such major companies as general motors corp. federal express corp. and procter & gamble co. as well as a <unk> of smaller firms 
 reflecting the <unk> interest more than N u.s. companies are taking part in a moscow exhibition organized by mr. <unk> 's trade group 
 but while u.s. interest may be big and growing the difficulties that have <unk> deals in the past show no sign of <unk> 
 alongside the old problems of a <unk> currency and an <unk> bureaucracy western business executives must now <unk> with new <unk> linked to perestroika the restructuring of the soviet economy 
 executives say mr. gorbachev 's moves to break up the government 's foreign trade monopoly have created uncertainties as well as opportunities 
 changing legislation has opened the field to thousands of <unk> soviet players many who promise more than they can deliver 
 and some foreign firms are finding that even when they manage to overcome such hurdles their ventures now have to be endorsed by such <unk> bodies as the soviet parliament and the governments of the nation 's republics 
 you have to go out to all your constituents says james h. <unk> who is <unk> the most ambitious attempt by u.s. firms to break into the soviet market involving investment of more than $ N billion in some two dozen joint ventures 
 as part of that attempt by the american trade consortium mr. <unk> says he spends a lot of time lobbying 
 growing public fears about the soviet environment is one new factor affecting some joint-venture plans 
 over the past two years soviet ministries have been talking to international firms including occidental petroleum co. and combustion engineering inc. of the u.s. montedison <unk> of italy and several japanese groups about jointly building and operating several big petrochemical plants 
 the plans have come under fire from soviet environmentalists and officials say many are likely to be scaled back or dropped 
 whatever the difficulties mr. gorbachev remains committed to increasing foreign trade 
 for political as well as economic reasons u.s. companies are at the top of his priorities a point he underscored by spending two hours walking around the u.s. trade show last week 
 talking to a small group of u.s. executives <unk> mr. gorbachev appeared <unk> for a big expansion in u.s.-soviet trade which now amounts to a <unk> $ N billion annually 
 the u.s. ranks fourth of countries that have concluded joint ventures behind west germany finland and italy 
 according to several people present at the meeting mr. gorbachev also supported the idea of concluding several commercial accords with the u.s. possibly at his next summit meeting with president bush 
 judging by the crush at the exhibition deprived soviet consumers are more than ready for u.s. products 
 hundreds of people lined up every day at the colgate-palmolive co. stand to receive a free tube of <unk> a commodity in <unk> short supply here

 both colgate and procter & gamble have received big orders for <unk> soap and <unk> 
 the american trade consortium says it is planning to ship some $ N million of consumer goods financed by bank credits in the first few months of next year 
 but the current soviet purchasing spree may be a one-time affair 
 the goal of most u.s. firms joint ventures remains <unk> 
 because the soviet ruble is n't convertible into dollars marks and other western currencies companies that hope to set up production facilities here must either export some of the goods to earn hard currency or find soviet goods they can take in a <unk> transaction 
 international competition for the few soviet goods that can be sold on world markets is heating up however

 several medical concerns including pfizer inc. hewlett-packard co. colgate and <unk> laboratories intend to pursue a similar consortium approach 
 it 's hard to invest capital here on the same basis as investing in other countries says dennis a. <unk> president of medical service partners inc. who is putting the medical consortium together 
 some u.s. entrepreneurs operate on a smaller scale 
 one group seeks to publish a u.s.-soviet medical journal in <unk> with the u.s.s.r. ministry of health 
 according to richard p. mills a <unk> official of the u.s. partner N copies of the quarterly will be printed in russian from next year 
 it will be financed by advertisements from u.s. companies and by simultaneous publication of an <unk> journal containing details of soviet medical <unk>

 credit agricole asked a milan court to sequester the nuovo banco shares the italian news agency <unk> reported

 no reason for the request was given 
 credit agricole officials could n't be immediately reached for comment 
 the decision to accept credit agricole 's bid valued at N billion lire $ N million came after a <unk> weekend meeting

 since then the bank has strengthened its italian network and has posted strong results 
 the shareholders felt we needed a foreign presence more than we needed links with an insurance company an ambrosiano spokeswoman said 
 <unk> said in a statement that it reserves the right to take any action to protect its rights as a member of the syndicate

 qintex australia has n't disclosed its borrowings but analysts estimate the company 's debt at a$ N billion 
 mr. skase also said the restructuring plan calls for the merger of qintex australia with qintex ltd. which owns N N of qintex australia 
 he said the move will significantly reduce administrative and operating costs but he did n't provide details of the merger 
 company officials said over the weekend that qintex australia 's bank creditors have become concerned about a <unk> of bad news at the company including a failed us$ N billion plan to buy mgm\/ua communications co. a beverly hills calif. movie and television production concern 
 friday qintex entertainment inc. a <unk> u.s. affiliate filed for protection from creditor lawsuits under chapter N of the u.s. bankruptcy code 
 analysts predicted that the move would further shake creditor confidence in qintex australia and force it to sell assets 
 the company 's latest moves were disclosed after the australian stock exchange suspended trading in shares of qintex australia and qintex ltd. because the companies had n't answered an exchange inquiry about the extent of their loans investments and deposits at qintex entertainment 
 mr. skase 's statement was addressed to the stock exchange and appeared to be a response to the inquiry 
 it said qintex entertainment owes qintex australia us$ N million in loans not secured by specific assets 
 qintex australia also said it has an investment of a$ N million in qintex entertainment shares 
 in the statement mr. skase said that on the basis of current interest rates in australia the company 's asset sales would reduce interest expense by about a$ N million a year in addition to eliminating certain liabilities 
 in march qintex sold N N of the three mirage resorts to japan 's nippon <unk> co. and mitsui & co. for a$ N million 
 yesterday 's statement did n't say whether the japanese companies will acquire qintex 's remaining stake in the resorts

 they were what he called an unlawful termination by mgm\/ua of the acquisition agreement with qintex high australian interest rates a pilots ' strike at australian domestic airlines that cut revenue at the company 's australian resorts and delays in completing a sale of two regional tv stations in <unk> state 
 mgm\/ua has sued qintex australia for breach of contract and fraud over the collapsed acquisition agreement and qintex australia has threatened a <unk>

 two of the directors resigned mr. skase said so the payments have n't yet been approved 
 chip 's memory is here today here tomorrow 
 two companies plan to market a new chip with ceramic circuits that store data even when the power is off 
 today 's most widely used <unk> chips have volatile memories their data disappear if they are n't fed a steady diet of electricity so they need external power supplies 
 national semiconductor corp. and a start-up named <unk> corp. plan to start shipping so-called <unk> memories which can remember data for at least N years without any current flowing to them 
 the chips use materials such as lead <unk> <unk> to form <unk> switches that retain their data without electricity 
 developers caution that broad applications are several years away because the technology is n't fully refined 
 but <unk> of colorado springs colo. plans to start shipping commercial quantities of simple <unk> chips in december 
 the company expects the chips eventually to be used in devices that mimic a whole range of computer memory equipment including <unk> and hard-disk drives 
 national semiconductor is getting <unk> technology from <unk> corp. in <unk> <unk> 
 national says it agreed to acquire <unk> 's assets and will start shipping commercial quantities of its first chips including a <unk> memory next year 
 once production hurdles are overcome the chips could take over a significant part of the market 
 in addition to not <unk> an outside power source they are potentially cheaper to make because they require fewer manufacturing steps than conventional chips 
 military buyers have shown interest national says because <unk> chips resist <unk> radiation 
 and while today 's <unk> chips such as electronically <unk> <unk> <unk> memory chips ca n't be used in a computer 's central memory because they learn data slowly <unk> chips accept data at very high speeds 
 showing up in court without being there 
 an austin texas company plans to make it easy for you show up in court a thousand miles away without leaving town

 that means huge travel bills

 that could change thanks to lower long-distance rates and cheaper electronics 
 video <unk> corp. which markets <unk> systems is working with court reporters to wire a nationwide network to allow <unk> by live television 
 the company installed a prototype system that <unk> dallas with miami over digital phone lines 
 and it is preparing to set up shop in chicago new york and N other cities where <unk> agencies can tie conference rooms into the network

 japanese reverse <unk> on patent protection 
 japan 's <unk> of u.s. patents has been a <unk> point for american chip makers 
 now at least one japanese company is turning the courtroom tables 
 until now most japanese charges have been responses to suits against them 
 but last year hitachi ltd. surprised japan 's electronics industry when it accused korea 's <unk> electronics co. of using hitachi technology to make dynamic <unk> memory chips 
 a settlement was reached but was n't made public 
 and hitachi went on the offensive against the u.s. 's motorola inc. earlier this month with a suit charging that motorola 's new <unk> chip <unk> on a hitachi patent 
 another recent hitachi suit <unk> motorola of reverse engineering a hitachi technology a <unk> from a nation of champion reverse engineers 
 the moves illustrate the more aggressive attitude toward patent protection that patent experts say japan is starting to take 
 hitachi made the <unk> charges in an amendment to a <unk> filed in a federal district court in texas after motorola sued hitachi for patent violation 
 hitachi charges motorola has engaged in fraudulent and <unk> conduct in the procurement of certain motorola patents used in motorola 's <unk> microprocessor chip 
 translation motorola appears to have taken a hitachi technology that is <unk> in the u.s. hitachi says and tried to make it look like a new technology 
 motorola either denied or would n't comment on the various charges

 tandy corp. citing sluggish sales of <unk> goods said net income dropped N N for the first quarter ended sept. N 
 the results which represented the fifth consecutive quarter of <unk> earnings for the big electronics retailer disappointed analysts and traders 
 tandy 's stock fell $ N a share to close at $ N in new york stock exchange composite trading 
 net for the quarter was $ N million or N cents a share down from $ N million or N cents a share a year earlier 
 the company said earnings would have increased if it had n't been actively <unk> its shares thus increasing its interest expense and reducing its interest income 
 tandy had N million shares outstanding at sept. N down from N million a year earlier 
 revenue rose N N to $ N million from $ N million 
 tandy said consumer electronics sales at its radio shack stores have been slow partly because of a lack of hot new products 
 radio shack continues to be lackluster said dennis <unk> analyst with <unk> <unk> & turner in dallas 
 he said tandy has done a decent job increasing sales by manufacturing computers for others and expanding sales of its grid systems corp. subsidiary which sells computers to bigger businesses but it 's not enough to offset the problems at radio shack 
 sales at radio shack stores open more than a year grew only N N in the quarter from a year earlier he said 
 as a result mr. <unk> said he cut his fiscal N per-share earnings estimate for tandy to $ N from $ N 
 tandy earned $ N million or $ N a share in the year ended june N 
 barry bryant an analyst with drexel burnham lambert inc. said tandy also has suffered from <unk> sales of its computers aimed at the home and <unk> market which are <unk> and cheaper than computers aimed at the corporate market 
 tandy has added several new products to that line including a laptop computer priced around $ N and is focusing its advertising on the <unk> software that is packaged with its machines 
 mr. bryant and other analysts hope all those moves will combine to help tandy 's results improve in the important christmas quarter 
 they 've been promising N N to N N growth based on the strategic moves they 've made he said 
 if the earnings acceleration is to take place that should be the quarter 
 at a private dinner thursday drexel burnham lambert inc. chief executive frederick joseph delivered a <unk> message about the junk bond market to officials of prudential insurance co. of america 
 mr. joseph conceded the junk market was in disarray according to people familiar with the discussion 
 he said drexel the leading underwriter of high-risk junk bonds could no longer afford to sell any junk offerings if they might later become troubled because drexel <unk> losing its highly lucrative junk franchise 
 the dinner was a stark confirmation that N is the worst year ever for the $ N billion junk market 
 and investors and traders alike say the current turmoil could take years to resolve 
 amid the market <unk> even drexel which has the <unk> and most loyal following of junk bond investors is pulling in its <unk> 
 although the big investment bank still dominates the junk market drexel has been unable to stem the fallout from growing junk bond defaults withdrawn new offerings redemptions by shareholders in junk bond mutual funds and an exodus of <unk> investors 
 for many money managers the past four months have been <unk> 
 this is the worst <unk> ever in the junk market and it could take years before it 's over says mark <unk> a senior vice president at standard & poor 's corp. a credit rating company 
 in the third quarter for example junk bonds those with less than an investment-grade rating showed negative returns the only major sector of the bond market to do so 
 since the end of last year junk bonds have been outperformed by all categories of investment-grade bonds including <unk> treasury securities 
 the junk market which <unk> to $ N billion from less than $ N billion at the start of the decade has been declining for months as issuers have <unk> under the weight of hefty interest payments 
 the fragile market received its biggest jolt last month from campeau corp. which created its u.s. retailing empire with more than $ N billion in junk financing 
 campeau developed a cash squeeze that caused it to be <unk> on some interest payments and to put its prestigious bloomingdale 's department store chain up for sale 
 at that point the junk market went into a tailspin as buyers disappeared and investors tried to sell 
 in an interview mr. joseph says his dinner discussion with the prudential executives acknowledged problems for junk 
 what i thought i was saying is that the market is troubled but still viable and <unk> enough quite <unk> which is not at all bad he says 
 nobody 's been perfect in their credit judgments the past couple years and we 're going to make sure our default rates are going to be in the acceptable <unk> of the market 
 what has jolted many junk buyers is the sudden <unk> that junk bonds can not necessarily be bought and sold with the ease of common stocks and many investment-grade bonds 
 unlike the new york stock exchange where buyers and sellers are quickly matched the junk market where risky corporate loans are traded is sometimes closed for repairs 
 at closely held <unk> securities corp. junk bond money managers <unk> k. <unk> and <unk> h. <unk> say the problems of the junk market go deeper than a temporary <unk> 
 in recent months they say there has been heavy selling of junk bonds by some of the market 's traditional investors while new buyers have n't materialized to replace them 
 wall street securities firms the primary source of liquidity for the high yield market have been net sellers of junk bonds because of trading losses <unk> said in a recent grim report to customers 
 mutual funds have also been net sellers of junk bonds as junk 's relatively poor performance and negative press coverage have produced <unk> redemptions by shareholders <unk> said 
 investors trying to raise cash have sold large liquid issues such as rjr holdings corp. and <unk> co. declines in these benchmark issues have contributed to the market 's <unk> 
 and <unk> said buying has been severely reduced because savings and loans have been restricted in their junk purchases by recently passed congressional legislation 
 in fact savings and loans were sellers of high yield holdings throughout the quarter <unk> said 
 ms. <unk> and ms. <unk> say they are managing their junk portfolios <unk> building cash and <unk> upgrading the overall quality 
 meanwhile prudential the nation 's largest insurer and the biggest investor in junk bonds has seen the value of its junk bond portfolio drop to $ N billion from $ N billion since august because of falling junk prices 
 we certainly do have a lack of liquidity here and it 's something to be concerned about says james a. <unk> a managing director 
 i have no reason to think things will get worse but this market has a <unk> for surprising us 
 this market teaches us to be <unk> 
 the junk market 's yield <unk> are learning a real painful lesson he says 
 although the majority of junk bonds outstanding show no signs of default the market has downgraded many junk issues as if they were in trouble says stuart <unk> manager of aetna life & casualty insurance co. 's $ N billion investment-grade public bond portfolio 
 but we think the risks are there for things getting a lot worse 
 and the risks are n't appropriate for us he says 
 the big insurer unlike prudential owns only about $ N million of publicly sold junk bonds 
 the string of big junk bond defaults which have been a major cause of the market 's problems this year probably will <unk> some analysts say 
 if anything we 're going to see defaults increase because credit ratings have declined says paul <unk> associate professor at the massachusetts institute of technology 's sloan school of management 
 mr. <unk> whose study on junk bond defaults caused a furor on wall street when it was disclosed last april says this year 's junk bond defaults already show a high <unk> with his own findings 
 his study showed that junk bonds over time had a cumulative default rate of N N 
 one indication of a growing number of junk defaults mr. <unk> says is that about half of the $ N billion of corporate bonds outstanding that have been lowered to a default rating by s&p this year are junk bonds sold during the market 's big issue years of N through N 
 these bonds now rated <unk> include junk offerings by <unk> industries columbia savings colorado first texas savings association <unk> financial corp. integrated resources inc. metropolitan broadcasting corp. resorts international inc. southmark corp. and <unk> inc 
 obviously we got a lot more smoke than fire from the people who told us the market was n't so risky says bradford cornell professor of finance at university of california 's anderson graduate school of management in los angeles 
 mr. cornell has just completed a study that finds that the risks and returns of junk bonds are less than on common stocks but more than on investment-grade bonds 
 mr. cornell says the junk market is no <unk> as drexel claimed but it also is n't a disaster as the <unk> say 
 despite the junk market 's problems drexel continues to enjoy a loyalty among junk bond investors that its wall street rivals have n't found 
 during the past three weeks for example drexel has sold $ N billion of new junk bonds for turner broadcasting co. uniroyal chemical continental air and duff & phelps 
 still the list of troubled drexel bond offerings <unk> that of any firm on wall street as does its successful offerings 
 troubled <unk> issues include resorts international <unk> integrated resources sci tv gillette holdings western electric and southmark 
 quality junk bonds will continue to trade well says michael <unk> chairman of salomon brothers asset management inc

 like which are <unk> and which are not 
 with the fall social season well under way <unk> are out in force trying to <unk> their <unk> and sometimes put down their <unk>

 name-dropping is pervasive and getting more so as society becomes more complex and <unk> says herbert <unk> a new york <unk> with a <unk> <unk> 
 it can be an avenue of <unk> to a certain sector of society 
 it provides some people a needed sense of <unk> and can help open up a conversation with someone you do n't know 
 like the long island <unk> in the theater district the other day who <unk> to a <unk> that she once met <unk> <unk> 
 i was having a drink in <unk> 's when all of a sudden i saw a woman 's <unk> coming up the steps on the second floor and she was wearing <unk> <unk> 
 i knew it was someone important so i followed her into the <unk> room and sure enough it was <unk> 
 so i said <unk> 
 and she said <unk> 
 can you imagine 
 <unk> said <unk> to me 
 some people must drop names call it an <unk> <unk>

 <unk> <unk> a new york writer who changed his name from william stretch in N is an <unk> <unk>

 i guess i might have asked <unk> to leave but he drops so many good names we decided to let him stay says steven greenberg publisher of fame

 mr. <unk> says that at the party he <unk> to malcolm <unk> publisher of <unk> magazine <unk> been in the columns together mary boone a new york art dealer i think she knows me but i 'm not sure and <unk> <unk> the actress she knows me but we 're not really the best of friends 
 mr. <unk> the <unk> columnist says there are people who actually plan whose names they are going to drop before attending a party 
 these <unk> do n't <unk> only their <unk> with the <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> mosbacher 
 they even drop <unk> names like <unk> <unk> whom everybody these days apparently has heard of but no one really knows says mr. <unk> 
 it 's the <unk> of name-dropping that counts 
 but name-dropping has other benefits often civic 
 in the name of civic pride and from the desire to <unk> a negative image some city <unk> seek to link their <unk> with the most <unk> names the city has to offer 
 take cleveland 
 it has gotten a bad rep because its once heavily <unk> <unk> river caught fire because former mayor ralph <unk> set his hair on fire with an <unk> <unk> and because its proposed rock <unk> roll hall of fame was recently refused an <unk> grant 
 some people call it the mistake on the lake lake <unk> that is 
 it helps to point out how many important people came through cleveland on their way to the top says george miller executive director of the new cleveland campaign a nonprofit organization devoted to citing the city 's strengths 
 mr. miller notes that actor paul <unk> 's family owned a <unk> store in cleveland that the late actress margaret hamilton who played the bad <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> once ran a <unk> school in cleveland and that <unk> bob hope 's father a <unk> once worked on a church next to <unk> hall cleveland 's main concert hall

 americans now can choose among N different models of cars vans and trucks up from just N when the decade began according to automotive news a trade publication 
 for car marketers it has become a much tougher battle to keep loyal customers from <unk> to one of the new makes on the block 
 for american car buyers the proliferation of choice is both <unk> and confusing 
 malcolm <unk> vice chairman of the jordan <unk> case & taylor advertising agency in new york calls the proliferation <unk> mania 
 he says the number of automobile choices is causing stress among consumers today and that people will simply ignore new models that lack a <unk> image 
 the winners he predicts will be brands from car makers that have traditionally been associated with quality and value 
 he says it 's important for a new make to be as distinctive as possible while still retaining links to the parent company 's quality image 
 he <unk> toyota and nissan motor co. for creating separate divisions for their new luxury models rather than simply adding more <unk> to their standard car lines 
 some auto executives believe the benefits of more choice outweigh the <unk> 
 there 's more noise out there and the consumer may have to work harder to cut through it says vincent p. <unk> executive director of market research and planning at general motors corp

 which cars do americans favor most these days 
 it 's hard to <unk> but age seems to be the best <unk> 
 adults under age N like sports cars luxury cars <unk> and imports far more than their elders do 
 three of every N buyers under N would prefer to buy a sports car compared with just N N of adults N and over according to the journal survey 
 young consumers prefer luxury cars by a N N to N N margin even though older buyers because of their incomes are more likely to actually purchase a luxury car

 program trading on the new york stock exchange in september rose to its highest recorded level as a percentage of total monthly trading volume

 program trading amounted to N N of average daily volume in june 
 the big board says program trading describes a variety of strategies involving the purchase or sale of a basket of N or more stocks 
 the most controversial of these is stock-index arbitrage in which traders buy or sell baskets of stocks and offset the position with an opposite trade in stock-index futures to lock in profits 
 it 's the most controversial form of program trading because it can create abrupt price swings in the stock market 
 salomon brothers inc. was the top program trader in september but most of the firm 's activity involved portfolio trading strategies other than stock-index arbitrage 
 overall salomon reported program trading volume of N million shares

 the complaint filed in federal district court <unk> imperial and other defendants of issuing false and misleading financial data 
 it also charges that imperial the holding company for imperial savings & loan experienced major losses and <unk> because of improper assessment of the risks of junk-bond investments and wholesale consumer loan packages 
 the suit seeks unspecified damages 
 imperial is in the midst of reducing its junk-bond holdings and getting out of the investment banking business in order to return to traditional thrift activities 
 the derivative suit is similar to a class-action complaint filed earlier this year 
 imperial said in a statement it expects other complaints to be filed in the wake of the original suit and a recent article in barron 's magazine that focused on the company 's problems 
 although an imperial spokesman said the company had n't yet been served with the derivative suit he reiterated the company 's statement that it would vigorously defend itself against the class-action suit 
 spokesmen at drexel and first executive said the companies had n't yet been served with the suit 
 in a separate complaint also filed in federal court here shareholder max <unk> of new york charged imperial its top executives and directors with breach of fiduciary duty and <unk> the company 's assets

 eastman kodak co. seeking to position itself in the potentially huge high-definition television market unveiled a <unk> that can transform conventional <unk> film into high-definition video 
 the move also helps the rochester n.y. photographic giant ensure that its <unk> film business for which it holds a <unk> monopoly supplying every hollywood movie company is n't made <unk> by the <unk> hdtv business 
 while the prototype <unk> is costly it 's being <unk> by the <unk> hdtv industry as a way of increasing the number of high-quality shows that can be seen on the new medium 
 the industry has been waiting with <unk> breath for the machines to come along says david <unk> president of <unk> <unk> five productions inc. a new york pioneer in high-definition programming 
 he notes that industry executives have until now worried that they would face a severe shortage of programs once consumers begin replacing their tv sets with <unk> 
 japanese electronic giants such as sony corp. and hitachi ltd. have focused almost entirely on hdtv hardware and virtually ignored software or programs shot in high-definition 
 and only a handful of small u.s. companies are engaged in high-definition software development 
 it 's estimated that just about N hours of <unk> programming is currently available for airing 
 kodak says its new <unk> hdtv <unk> will help alleviate the problem by allowing programmers and broadcasters to convert movies and television programs shot in <unk> <unk> film into high-definition video 
 consumers will be able to switch on their hdtv sets and get all the <unk> benefits the high-tech medium offers 
 otherwise they 'd be watching programs that are no different in quality from what they currently view on color tvs 
 it would be like watching a black and white movie on a color tv set says malcolm g. <unk> chairman of the film and video department at the rochester institute of technology 
 the new <unk> are a critical link between film and the television <unk> says <unk> d. <unk> vice president and general manager of kodak 's motion picture and <unk> products division 
 kodak wo n't disclose the cost or when its <unk> will be on the market but it 's estimated the machine may be available within two years 
 a similar machine already on the market made by rank <unk> ltd. a unit of rank <unk> costs about $ N 
 and the potential market is tremendous industry experts say 
 if hdtv takes off in the u.s. there will be demand for some N to N hdtv <unk> known in the industry as <unk> 
 demand will come first from programming production companies and then from television stations 
 the <unk> is head and <unk> above anything else i 've seen says richard j. <unk> vice president engineering and development at mca inc. 's universal city studios 
 and mr. <unk> the program producer contends that kodak 's move is a sound marketing decision 
 they ca n't afford to stay out of hdtv 
 indeed the stakes are high 
 the u.s. electronics industry estimates that the hdtv market will total about $ N billion over the next two decades with an additional $ N billion expected to go for related products 
 <unk> break down images into more than N lines compared with N for today 's <unk> providing considerably sharper detail 
 and the sets are wider <unk> the <unk> of a movie screen 
 but the financial rewards are n't expected soon nor are they guaranteed 
 experts estimate the first sets of <unk> wo n't be available for another five to N years and will probably retail for more than $ N each in today 's dollars 
 some critics say they wo n't be quickly embraced by consumers because of the high price 
 nevertheless kodak could n't risk letting hdtv turn its <unk> film business into a <unk> 
 kodak understands hdtv is where everybody is going says <unk> 's mr. <unk> 
 yet another political scandal is <unk> japan 
 but this time it 's hurting opposition as well as <unk> members 
 and as it <unk> it 's <unk> some of the more <unk> and <unk> aspects of japanese society 
 already ruling liberal democratic party demands that opposition members testify under <unk> in parliament have stalled one budget committee session and forced the committee to plan a special two-day investigation at the end of the month 
 but the scandal itself is so <unk> that <unk> members are divided between those who want to pursue the matter in hope of <unk> the opposition and those who favor leaving well enough alone 
 the opposition can be the most hurt because everyone already figures the ldp is that kind of <unk> says <unk> <unk> former aide to ldp <unk> <unk> <unk> and now an independent analyst 
 but he adds we ca n't tell where it will go at all because we 're still in the middle of it 
 this time the scandal centers on donations made by the <unk> pachinko <unk> industry 
 pachinko a kind of <unk> is japan 's favorite form of legal gambling 
 the donations so far appear to be small especially compared with the huge sums that changed hands in the recruit co <unk> scandal that plagued the ruling party last year 
 but the implications could be great 
 pachinko is slightly on the <unk> side often linked to the lower ranks of japan 's <unk> and regularly at the top of annual lists of tax <unk> 
 recently the industry has faced the threat of new restrictions and political donations may have been made with the intent to bribe 
 also about N N of pachinko <unk> owners are korean many of whom maintain close ties with north or south korean residents ' organizations and donations by such foreign groups are illegal in japan 
 to many japanese pachinko is benign or <unk> <unk> 
 <unk> <unk> pachinko <unk> <unk> from the main streets and narrow <unk> of cities and towns across the country 
 <unk> pass hours watching the lights <unk> and listening to the metal balls <unk> as much to gamble as to get a little time to be <unk> alone with their thoughts 
 at N yen $ N for a handful of balls pachinko is a common <unk> and has been since it took root as cheap entertainment in the years after world war ii 
 but the total of all those <unk> balls has created an industry with a reported annual income of N trillion yen almost $ N billion or nearly the size of japan 's <unk> automobile industry 
 and because the pachinko industry is regularly at the top of annual lists for tax evasion some observers estimate the real income could be as much as N trillion yen 
 if that money were being taxed it could bring the government a badly needed several trillion yen 
 in N an attempt was made to crack down on the industry with tougher restrictions 
 then in N a proposal to keep better track of income by selling prepaid cards for pachinko was <unk> in parliament 
 the proposal split the industry in two along the lines of national <unk> north koreans oppose the plan while south koreans japanese and taiwanese accept it or are neutral 
 in august a conservative weekly magazine reported that a pachinko industry organization donated money to japan socialist party members 
 the magazine alleged that in making the donations the pachinko industry may have been offering <unk> to win support in the battle against prepaid cards or it may have been laundering money back and forth between the <unk> and the north korean residents ' organization the chosen <unk> 
 the chosen <unk> and the <unk> immediately denied the report 
 and at first neither the opposition nor the ldp wanted to pursue the issue 
 but the press kept it alive as with the recruit scandal lists began circulating with names of people who had received money 
 within a matter of weeks <unk> magazines reported that members of the ruling ldp had received much larger donations from pachinko organizations 
 so far though there have been no allegations that the contributions the ldp members received amounted to <unk> 
 then the two camps <unk> the <unk> reports that chosen <unk> had donated directly to <unk> members were rapidly <unk> by statements that the south korean residents ' organization had long been donating directly to ldp members 
 the <unk> admitted oct. N that its members received about eight million yen from the pachinko organization and charged ldp members with receiving N million yen $ N and other opposition parties with taking about N million yen 
 on friday the chief cabinet secretary announced that eight cabinet ministers had received five million yen from the industry including N yen $ N by prime minister <unk> <unk> 
 no one has alleged that the donations were by themselves illegal 
 direct donations from either of the residents ' organizations would be illegal because the groups are defined as foreign but both groups deny making direct donations 
 they say it s possible some of their members may be donating privately 
 the issue is further complicated because although the organizations represent korean residents those residents were largely born and raised in japan and many speak only japanese 
 that they retain korean <unk> and ties is a reflection of history their parents were shipped in as <unk> during the decades when japan occupied korea before world war ii and the discrimination that still faces koreans in japanese society 
 many japanese think it only natural that the organizations or their members would <unk> to politicians the way many japanese do to win favor or support 
 both residents ' organizations admit to receiving some funding from abroad 
 but ldp members and supporters of the prepaid card idea tend to speak in <unk> about the <unk> 's alleged donations <unk> that north korean money would be more suspect than south korean because north korea is communist and south korea is an ally 
 when robert mcduffie was N he got a chance to play in the starting lineup for his high school basketball team in <unk> <unk>

 she thought i was n't getting my practicing done 
 as the <unk> tells it his <unk> looking teacher put her hands on her <unk> <unk> her foot and said you 've just got to get the <unk> <unk> out of there 
 the second incident took place after mr. mcduffie gave an ambitious student recital and was feeling rather pleased with himself 
 miss delay requested that he come to her studio with a tape of the recital 
 we <unk> to the <unk> <unk> he recalls and she said you hear the first note that <unk> 
 that 's the only note that 's truly in tune 
 that 's the most important experience i 've had with any teacher he says because she taught me how to listen 
 now when i play with <unk> the musicians often <unk> me on my <unk> 
 it was also at <unk> that mr. mcduffie discovered his <unk> for conservative <unk> american <unk> such as david diamond and samuel barber 
 after winning a school competition with a performance of the latter 's violin <unk> mr. mcduffie was invited to play the work for the <unk> who was dying of cancer 
 barber was <unk> by the <unk> looking very pale recalls the <unk> who performed the work with a piano <unk> at the <unk> 's apartment 
 he did n't say much but what he said was important because it 's not in the score 
 there 's a beautiful <unk> <unk> he 'd kill me if he heard me say that throughout the first movement 
 the only time the violin has it is right at the end 
 it 's written <unk> in the score and i played it that way kind of <unk> 
 and he <unk> out <unk> <unk> sweet sweet 
 so we did it over he adds 
 i played very <unk> with the tip of the <unk> 
 if a <unk> is sensitive enough to bring down the <unk> volume at that point it makes the piece <unk> 
 i do n't know why barber never told anybody else 
 on <unk> stern 's recording it 's very <unk> 
 since leaving <unk> mr. mcduffie has made some smart moves and some controversial ones 
 his guest appearance on the nbc soap opera another world <unk> musical <unk> 
 by contrast he 's won <unk> for his <unk> of william <unk> 's violin <unk> which he recently recorded for <unk> along with leonard bernstein 's engaging <unk> for violin solo <unk> and <unk> 
 mr. mcduffie 's sweet tone <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> make him an ideal <unk> of both works 
 aided by the <unk> playing of the st. louis <unk> under leonard <unk> 's direction this <unk> really swings 
 mr. <unk> 's violin <unk> which sounds more like a mildly <unk> <unk> for solo violin with <unk> <unk> <unk> until the <unk> <unk> <unk> 
 but there are ample rewards in its <unk> slow sections and <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> and <unk> 
 at avery fisher hall here mr. mcduffie was heard recently with mr. <unk> and the warsaw <unk> in more conventional fare <unk> 's <unk> violin <unk> in <unk> minor 
 his performance was so <unk> and driven that the <unk> rarely <unk> 
 the <unk> <unk> played <unk> with a big <unk> sound that <unk> its size 
 whatever he plays mr. mcduffie finds satisfaction in the music itself something greater out there than me as he puts it during an interview at the manhattan apartment he shares with wife <unk> a literary <unk> 
 a normal person did not write the <unk> violin <unk> he declares 
 even when i hear it played badly i 'm still <unk> by the piece 
 if i could ever feel i 've contributed to it in some way then all the hard work has been worth it 
 ms. <unk> is a free-lance music writer in new york 
 are consumers too deep in <unk> 
 a lot of observers think so and if they 're right the whole economy as well as the <unk> among us could be hurt 
 a sudden forced <unk> by consumers who normally account for about two-thirds of economic activity would damp the economy at a time when <unk> spending is slowing and <unk> governments ca n't readily take up the slack 
 and another wave of bad loans would further <unk> many <unk> lending institutions 
 the <unk> cite some worrisome trends 
 during the almost <unk> economic expansion inflation-adjusted gross national product disposable personal income and personal consumption expenditures have risen N N but inflation-adjusted consumer installment credit has surged N N 
 and the ratio of installment debt to disposable personal income personal income after taxes has hit a high of about N N N 
 however these figures do n't seem to worry thomas a. durkin an economist at the federal reserve board 
 in a paper presented at the recent annual meeting of the national association of business economists in san francisco mr. durkin comments that installment credit always grows rapidly in cyclical advances and growth in this cycle is very typical of earlier <unk> 
 he adds we are now <unk> a slowdown which if history is a guide could <unk> for a while 
 but what about the debt burden 
 mr. durkin doubts that there is some magic level at which the ratio of installment debt to disposable income indicates economic problems 
 and more <unk> he says the debt burden measured other ways is not really in <unk> waters 
 the chart below shows why see accompanying illustration wsj oct. N N 
 the ratio of consumer installment credit to disposable income though up a bit has n't climbed <unk> and such debt as a percent of household assets is little changed 
 moreover the burden of consumer credit payments relative to disposable income may be lower in this cycle than earlier mr. durkin says 
 he notes that some revolving credit-card credit is actually convenience credit being used simply as a handy way of paying bills rather than a handy way of borrowing 
 in addition he says longer maturities on automobile and other forms of installment credit boost the stock of debt faster than the flow of <unk> and the accompanying payment burden 
 and if you consider the changing distribution of credit mr. durkin says much of the increase in debt in recent years is due to increasing credit use by <unk> families that is those probably best able to handle it 
 citing figures on home-equity loans he notes that N N of homeowners had home-equity credit accounts but the proportion rises to N N of homeowners in the $ <unk> income range and N N of homeowners with income above $ N 
 and much home-equity credit is used <unk> 
 the most frequent use is home improvement which presumably improves the value of the property mr. durkin says 
 so it is n't surprising that <unk> <unk> at banks remain as the chart shows <unk> below some earlier highs see accompanying illustration wsj oct. N N 
 a severe recession could of course raise <unk> rates but so far the current levels of consumer debt do n't seem to <unk> as a major threat 
 in fact the current weakness in auto buying and department-store sales and the gradual <unk> in the household saving rate suggest that consumers conservative as ever are already <unk> their <unk> a bit more tightly 
 in july consumer installment credit outstanding fell for the first time since january N 
 consumers appear unwilling to add to their leverage to support their spending bruce steinberg a merrill lynch economist says 
 as a result household debt appears to be stabilizing at around N N of gnp 
 consumers credit cards in hand are n't running <unk> through the shopping <unk> or putting the economy at any great risk 
 maidenform inc. <unk> to be intimate with its customers but not with the rest of the public 
 the <unk> maker of <unk> <unk> and <unk> enjoys one of the best-known brand images but its financial profile is closely <unk> by members of the founding family 
 there are very few companies that can <unk> of such a <unk> group says robert a. brawer N years old recently named president succeeding beatrice coleman his <unk> who remains chairman 
 we are a <unk> breed he <unk> 
 mrs. coleman N who declined to be interviewed is the maidenform strategist 
 sales have tripled during her <unk> tenure to about $ N million in N 
 maidenform says it is very profitable but declines to provide <unk> 
 the company sells image 
 its current ad campaign on which maidenform has spent more than $ N million since fall N does n't even show its underwear products but rather men like christopher <unk> star of the <unk> movies talking about their <unk> <unk> 
 the maidenform name is part of american pop culture says joan <unk> account supervisor of the campaign by levine <unk> <unk> & <unk> a new york ad firm 
 maidenform generated such <unk> campaigns as i <unk> i in my maidenform <unk> and the maidenform woman 
 you never know where she 'll turn up 
 <unk> on the brand is key says mr. brawer whose immediate plans include further international expansion and getting better control of distribution outside the u.s. 
 the intimate apparel industry is perceived to be a growth industry and clearly maidenform is a force to be <unk> with says david s. <unk> a special situations analyst at american securities corp. in new york 
 although working women are forced to wear the uniform of the day to retain their <unk> they are buying better quality more upscale intimate apparel he said 
 although mr. brawer 's appointment as president was long expected the move on sept. N <unk> the resignation of alan lesk as senior vice president of sales and merchandising 
 three days later mr. lesk was named president and chief executive officer of <unk> co. a competing intimate apparel division of <unk> inc 
 <unk> also owns <unk> another major intimate apparel maker 
 mr. lesk could n't be reached to comment 
 but maidenform officials say that after spending N years at maidenform mr. lesk N made it clear he wanted the top job 
 if you want the presidency of the company this is n't the firm to work for says james <unk> N who was named senior vice president of sales assuming some of the responsibilities of mr. lesk 
 the company <unk> the loss of mr. lesk and split his merchandising responsibilities among a committee of four people 
 my style is less informal mr. brawer says 
 top officers insist maidenform 's greatest strength is its family ownership 
 you ca n't go anywhere in this company and find an <unk> chart one <unk> 
 it is fun competing as a private company mr. brawer says 
 you can think long range 
 other major players in intimate apparel apparently feel the same way 
 <unk> was taken private by spectrum group in N for about $ N million 
 and last year <unk> holdings inc. went private for about $ N million 
 it was then split into <unk> apparel inc. the intimate apparel division and <unk> family products corp. which makes <unk> <unk> items and other products 
 publicly traded <unk> corp. which owns <unk> fair and <unk> lee corp. which owns <unk> co. are also strong forces in intimate apparel 
 buy-out offers for maidenform are n't <unk> says executive vice president david c. <unk> but they are n't taken very seriously 
 when he gets calls i do n't even have to <unk> with mrs. coleman mr. <unk> says 
 the company could command a good price in the market 
 over the past three and a half years apparel companies many of whom have strong brand names have been bought at about N N of sales says <unk> <unk> prudential-bache securities inc. apparel analyst 
 mr. brawer along with mrs. coleman and her daughter elizabeth an attorney who is vice chairman are the family members involved in the operations of maidenform which employs about N 
 mr. brawer 's wife <unk> and robert <unk> elizabeth 's husband round out the <unk> board 
 each has an equal vote at the monthly meetings 
 we are all very <unk> mr. brawer says 
 executives say mrs. coleman is very involved in the day-to-day operations especially product development 
 in the late 1960s she designed a <unk> stretch <unk> that boosted sales 
 her father william rosenthal designed the <unk> making company 's first <unk> in the 1920s which he said gave women a <unk> form compared with the <unk> form they got from the flat <unk> used for support at the time 
 while mr. rosenthal introduced new <unk> designs his wife <unk> concentrated on sales and other financial matters 
 the name maidenform was <unk> by a third business partner <unk> <unk> 
 the company has N plants and distribution facilities in the u.s. puerto rico other parts of the caribbean and ireland 
 maidenform products are mainly sold at department stores but the company has quietly opened a retail store of its own in omaha neb. and has N factory outlets with plans to add more 
 before joining maidenform in N mr. brawer who holds a <unk> degree in english from the university of chicago taught at the university of wisconsin 
 as a senior vice president he has headed the company 's designer <unk> division <unk> de la <unk> since its inception in N 
 to maintain exclusivity of that designer line it is n't labeled with the maidenform name 
 while the company has always been <unk> mr. brawer is n't the first person to <unk> into the family and subsequently head maidenform 
 mrs. coleman 's husband joseph a physician succeeded mrs. rosenthal as president and served in that post until his death in N 
 china could <unk> its foreign-exchange reserves as early as next year a western government report says unless imports are cut drastically to help narrow the <unk> deficit 
 according to the report completed last month if china 's trade gap continues to widen at the pace seen in the first seven months of this year the reserves would be wiped out either in N or N 
 a country is considered financially healthy if its reserves cover three months of its imports 
 the $ N billion of reserves china had in june would cover just that much 
 the report by the western government which declines to be identified concludes that a near-term foreign-exchange payment problem can be avoided only if import growth drops to below N N per <unk> 
 according to chinese customs figures import growth has slowed in recent months dropping to N N in july and N N in august from the year-earlier periods compared with an average growth rate of N N in the first half 
 but before import growth slowed china 's buying spree in the first half already had taken its toll on foreign-exchange reserves 
 the $ N billion level in june marked a drop from $ N billion at the end of april 
 china 's last big import binge sent reserves tumbling to $ N billion in june N from $ N billion the previous september 
 china might <unk> off a crisis if it acts as <unk> as it did to arrest the N decline when beijing <unk> the <unk> on foreign-exchange spending and <unk> the currency 
 but this time china faces a more difficult battle because of economic forces that have come into play since the <unk> square killings june N 
 for example china 's <unk> income is expected to suffer from the big drop in tourist <unk> since june N 
 revenue from tourism this year is projected to total $ N billion down from $ N billion last year 
 because of this and the huge trade gap the deficit in china 's current account which measures trade in goods and services plus certain <unk> transfers of funds is expected to widen sharply from the $ N billion deficit last year 
 the western government report suggests a number of scenarios for china 's <unk> balance two of which are considered most likely 
 in one imports and exports continue to grow at the respective average rates of N N and N N recorded during the first seven months and the <unk> deficit widens to $ N billion 
 in N china had a record deficit of $ N billion 
 the other scenario assumes that beijing takes effective actions to curb imports in the coming months 
 in this case china would still finish the year with a <unk> deficit of $ N billion based on projections that imports for all of this year grow N N and exports N N 
 if china were still on good terms with foreign lenders it might be able to stem the drain on its foreign-exchange reserves by using some loan funds to offset the <unk> deficit 
 but since june foreign bankers led by international financial institutions have virtually suspended their new loans to china 
 even if borrowing <unk> commercial bankers are n't expected to lend as much as before 
 in addition economists are forecasting a slowdown in foreign direct investments as businessmen become increasingly wary of china 's deteriorating political and economic environment 
 on top of all this <unk> <unk> are expected to peak in N to N 
 with less capital coming in china 's balance of payments would suffer 
 the western government report 's first scenario assumes a N N reduction in foreign borrowing and a N N <unk> in foreign direct investment 
 in the second foreign borrowing is projected to grow N N and investment to drop N N 
 but in either case the report says china 's balance of payments would rapidly dry up foreign reserves which are used to finance the <unk> 
 in the first scenario the reserves would be exhausted next year and in the second they would be wiped out in N 
 <unk> holding ag parent of the swiss chemical and pharmaceutical group said its group sales rose N N in the first nine months of the year to N billion francs $ N billion 
 the company reported good gains in all of its divisions 
 <unk> also said it expects a considerable rise in N group profit from the N <unk> $ N million net in N 
 new <unk> investments inc. said it closed the acquisition of <unk> glass co. from <unk> co. a <unk> ill. maker of <unk> home products 
 terms were n't disclosed 
 <unk> a maker of glass bottles for the cosmetics and <unk> industries had sales last year of about $ N million 
 new <unk> investments is a closely held investment partnership with interests primarily in the packaging industry 
 ralph brown was N feet over minnesota when both jets on his falcon N <unk> out 
 at N feet he says he and his <unk> were looking for an interstate or a <unk> to land 
 at N feet the engines <unk> 
 but knowing that <unk> would probably ground him for repairs mr. brown <unk> his stop in nearby chicago and set course to get his load a few hundred <unk> to the memphis <unk> hub on time 
 had he been a little less <unk> i 'd have gotten the thing on the ground and headed for the <unk> bar mr. brown says 
 but he flies for federal express corp. perhaps the <unk> thing in corporate america to the green <unk> 
 federal 's employees work long hours and seem to <unk> on the stress of racing the <unk> 
 like mr. brown they sometimes go to surprising <unk> to meet that <unk> corporate goal delivering the goods on time 
 they are a <unk> to federal 's management which since the company 's founding N years ago has had its way with its work force an unusual feat in the contentious transportation industry 
 that may soon change 
 this month federal 's N pilots including some N acquired along with tiger international inc. in february will decide whether to <unk> the powerful air line pilots association as their bargaining agent 
 the election which would bring the first major union to federal 's u.s. operations has <unk> new <unk> against devoted veterans such as mr. brown 
 it has also rattled federal 's strongly <unk> management which is already <unk> with <unk> <unk> operations and with falling profits 
 a union sooner or later has to have an adversary and it has to have a victory frederick w. smith federal 's chairman and chief executive says with <unk> 
 in our formula we do n't have any losers except the competition 
 what managers really fear is that the <unk> movement could spread beyond the pilots 
 under federal transportation law a government mediator is attempting to <unk> the <unk> of tiger 's job <unk> into federal 's 
 depending on the outcome the merged company may face union elections this fall among <unk> <unk> <unk> workers stock <unk> and flight <unk> 
 these groups constitute up to N N of its work force 
 unions would have a <unk> effect on the whole culture of the company says bernard la <unk> a professor at ohio state university at columbus and a federal consultant 
 that culture carefully <unk> by mr. smith leaves little if any room for unions 
 since founding the company the <unk> vietnam <unk> who is still only N years old has <unk> an <unk> of combat 
 flights are <unk> 
 mr. smith 's managers have at times been called <unk> <unk> <unk> 's guerrillas 
 the <unk> <unk> award the navy <unk> for a job well done is <unk> on federal 's workers who <unk> the call of duty 
 competitors are known as the enemy 
 to reinforce employees ' <unk> mr. smith pays well 
 he also lets workers <unk> steam through an elaborate <unk> procedure and as a <unk> fly free in empty <unk> seats 
 he gives <unk> talks in periodic family <unk> <unk> internationally on <unk> the company 's own television network 
 and with many of his N workers mr. smith 's <unk> attitude has caught on 
 james cleveland a <unk> who earned a <unk> <unk> for figuring out how to get a major customer 's <unk> load to its <unk> by N a.m. considers himself far more than a <unk> 
 we do n't just hand the customer the package 
 that 's just the beginning he says 
 in <unk> we run the show 
 david <unk> a longtime pilot <unk> at the mere suggestion that a union might <unk> with his flight schedule 
 this is america he says 
 nobody has the right to tell me how much i can work 
 such attitudes have given federal flexibility not only to rapidly implement new technology but to keep its work force extraordinarily lean 
 the company deliberately <unk> stretching employees ' schedules to the limit 
 but though <unk> work as many as N hours a week during the autumn rush they leave early during slack times while still being assured of a minimum <unk> 
 pilots as well routinely fly overtime to ensure that none are <unk> during seasonal lows 
 the operational freedom has also given federal a leg up on archrival united parcel service inc. the nation 's largest employer of united <unk> of <unk> members 
 ups wo n't discuss its labor practices but according to mr. cleveland a former ups employee and others union work rules prohibit ups drivers from doing more than carrying packages between customers and their vans 
 because ups drivers are n't permitted to load their own vehicles at the <unk> say these <unk> packages often get buried in the load and are delivered late 
 labor problems are the last thing mr. smith needs right now 
 although the tiger acquisition has brought federal a long way toward becoming the global player it wants to be it also has brought problems 
 it more than doubled federal 's long-term debt to $ N billion thrust the company into unknown territory heavy cargo and suddenly expanded its landing rights to N countries from four 
 federal on its own had n't been doing very well overseas 
 it had <unk> in its attempt to get into asia where treaty restrictions forced it to fly some planes <unk> on certain routes 
 on routes to south america the company had no backup jets to ensure delivery when planes were <unk> 
 in europe business suffered as federal bought several local companies only to have the managers quit 
 these and other problems squeezed federal 's profit margins last year to N N down from more than N N annually in the first half of the decade 
 earnings have plummeted too in each of the past three quarters 
 in the fiscal first period ended aug. N profit fell N N to $ N million or N cents a share mostly because of the tiger merger federal says 
 federal 's stock price however has held up well driven in part by the general <unk> of airline stocks analysts say 
 since trading as low as $ N a share in may federal 's shares have rallied as high as $ N in new york stock exchange composite trading 
 they closed friday at $ N down N cents on the day 
 there 's a certain irony in the fact that federal express faces its first union problems as a result of its tiger purchase 
 tiger itself was founded by a band of <unk> <unk> who had <unk> supplies over the <unk> from india to china during world war ii 
 in the early 1970s mr. smith <unk> his fledgling company on tiger 's innovation of <unk> and <unk> operations 
 but from early on tiger 's workers <unk> while federal 's never have 
 federal express officials acknowledge mistakes in their drive overseas but say it will pay off eventually 
 analysts expect federal 's earnings to improve again in its fiscal third quarter ending feb. N when the company should begin benefiting from tiger 's extra flights <unk> planes and landing rights 
 until then they expect the cost of <unk> the two carriers to continue <unk> profits 
 for now the union issue is the most <unk> of federal 's tiger problems management believes 
 although encouraging dialogue between managers and workers mr. smith does n't <unk> what he considers <unk> 
 when a large group of pilots once signed <unk> opposing <unk> and compensation changes he called a meeting in a company <unk> and dressed them down for challenging his authority 
 he then made most of the changes pilots say 
 that sort of approach however has n't worked since the addition of tiger 
 its N workers who had battled tiger 's management for years over <unk> were union members until the day of the merger when most of their unions were automatically <unk> 
 soon after the merger moreover federal 's management asked tiger 's pilots to sign an agreement <unk> that they could be fired any time without cause or notice 
 when the pilots refused the company <unk> it 
 mr. smith angered federal 's pilots too 
 in his <unk> to seal the deal with tiger chairman saul steinberg last august mr. smith ignored a promise that he had made to his own pilots three years ago that any <unk> acquired in future mergers would be <unk> put at the bottom of the pilot seniority list that <unk> work schedules pay and career options 
 the tiger merger agreement <unk> that the lists be combined on the basis of tenure 
 mr. smith is trying hard to <unk> the anger 
 and even some <unk> pilots say his <unk> and popularity among the many former military <unk> could be tough to beat 
 a lot of people are identifying a vote for representation as a vote against fred smith says <unk> <unk> a <unk> pilot and union activist 
 mr. smith and other top federal executives have met with tiger workers in los angeles ohio new york alaska asia and europe 
 recently they have appeared every few weeks in <unk> type <unk> <unk> <unk> arguments 
 in one video mr. smith defended his agreement to merge the <unk> lists 
 he said mr. steinberg had insisted that the merger talks move quickly 
 regulators as well might have <unk> the deal if tiger 's pilots had n't been protected he said 
 furthermore mr. smith added our contract with our pilots says that we will manage our fleet operations with their advice 
 it does n't give any particular group the ability to veto change 
 already the fight has been costly 
 the <unk> controversy along with the <unk> dispute has been turned over to the mediator 
 meanwhile the company is operating with two separate pilot groups and seniority lists and that is costing federal a big number says james <unk> executive vice president and chief operating officer 
 the issue has also cost federal management a lot of good will among its old pilots 
 they were willing to <unk> us because we had n't shown any <unk> any resistance says william <unk> a <unk> pilot and <unk> federal veteran 
 adds john <unk> a N <unk> and past chairman of the <unk> flight advisory board they 've made all these <unk> gestures to the flying tiger pilots and for us nothing 
 such <unk> could prove <unk> in the union vote 
 a large majority of the N former tiger <unk> support the union according to a union study 
 but though most of the N federal pilots are believed opposed it is unclear just how much their loyalty to mr. smith has been eroded 
 the fight has turned <unk> and among pilots at least has shattered the <unk> de corps that mr. smith worked so hard to build 
 <unk> pilots have held <unk> parties 
 some younger pilots say they have had to endure <unk> <unk> by senior pilots while flying across the country 
 and for now at least the competition is n't the only enemy 
 barney <unk> a N <unk> and leader of the <unk> forces said he has received two <unk> death threats and been challenged to a fight with tire <unk> by a <unk> 
 the pilots are either for us or extremely against us he says with a sigh 
 <unk> corp. said it obtained a $ N million export order for <unk> recovery vehicles and related support equipment 
 <unk> declined to say what country placed the order 
 the company said it received an order for N of the vehicles which retrieve tanks and other <unk> vehicles when they break down or are damaged and an option for N more 
 delivery is to begin in early N 
 <unk> produces products for defense industrial commercial and construction markets 
 the senate convicted u.s. district judge <unk> hastings of florida of eight impeachment articles removing the <unk> judge from his $ <unk> lifetime job 
 mr. hastings 's case was particularly <unk> because it marked the first time a federal official was <unk> and removed from office on charges of which a jury had acquitted him 
 in N mr. hastings was found not guilty of accepting a $ N bribe in a case before him the central charge on which the senate convicted him 
 he was only the sixth federal judge ever ousted from office after an impeachment trial 
 with no floor debate the senate on friday voted N to <unk> mr. hastings of perjury and conspiring to accept a bribe five votes more than needed 
 conviction on any single impeachment article was enough to remove judge hastings from office 
 he was found not guilty of three charges involving accusations that he had improperly disclosed information about a sensitive government investigation 
 the senate did n't vote on six lesser charges 
 although mr. hastings had been acquitted by a jury lawmakers handling the prosecution in congress had argued that the purpose of impeachment is n't to punish an individual 
 instead they argued that impeachment aims to protect public institutions from people who have abused their positions of trust <unk> of the outcome of prior criminal or civil cases 
 mr. hastings faced the senators and sat <unk> during the first two <unk> votes then quickly left the chamber 
 in an <unk> news conference on the capitol steps he denounced the senators ' action 
 their opinion is <unk> of the wisdom of the <unk> ' teaching regarding impeachment mr. hastings said 
 for the future he said he would run for governor of florida 
 mr. hastings was appointed to the federal bench by president carter in N and was one of the few black federal judges in the country 
 while he packed the senate gallery with his supporters during some of the impeachment trial most civil rights groups kept their distance from his case 
 following the impeachment conviction dr. benjamin <unk> executive director of the national association for the <unk> of <unk> people issued a <unk> statement warning that the hastings case could set a dangerous precedent but adding we must respect the considered judgment of the senate

 what next for the <unk> fbi agent with the heart of gold 
 a spinoff series of course 
 there are plenty of worse <unk> for shows and most of them had already made the fall lineup 
 a <unk> raising some <unk> <unk> 
 a <unk> mother raising some <unk> <unk> models 
 a bunch of <unk> and <unk> suits <unk> as <unk> <unk> 
 in that context robert <unk> 's <unk> performance as the <unk> even <unk> veteran agent seems a better franchise for a series than most 
 week by week on mancuso fbi nbc <unk> N p.m <unk> he <unk> around the crime styles of the rich famous and powerful of the washington scene a loose <unk> on deck at the fbi 
 over the first few weeks mancuso fbi has <unk> straight from the <unk> which is either a <unk> <unk> at <unk> or a lack of <unk> or both 
 the opening show featured a secretary of defense <unk> accused of <unk> a la john tower 
 when his secretary is found floating dead in the <unk> 's pool mancuso is called in to investigate 
 last week a young black girl claimed she had been <unk> by a white police officer a la <unk> <unk> 
 in this week 's show there 's an <unk> nuclear <unk> facility a la rocky <unk> 
 along the way we 're introduced to the supporting cast a <unk> <unk> secretary <unk> <unk> her real name honest a <unk> young boss <unk> <unk> another <unk> <unk> who 's also an <unk> lawyer <unk> <unk> and a <unk> expert charles <unk> 
 if all of this seems a little <unk> it 's redeemed in part by some tricky plot <unk> 
 the usual suspects are found to be guilty then not guilty then guilty but of a different crime 
 in last week 's rape case for example the girl turns out to have been a victim of incest and the biggest <unk> are the politicians who exploit the case 
 most of all though the show is redeemed by the character of mancuso 
 what makes the veteran fbi man so <unk> is his <unk> <unk> earned we discover when he was assigned to the civil rights movement back in the 1960s 
 he was n't protecting the freedom <unk> he was <unk> them as <unk> 
 this is not the mississippi burning scenario that <unk> his young colleagues kid you 've been reading classic <unk> too long mancuso says 
 back in N the fbi had five black agents 
 three were <unk> for j. edgar <unk> and two <unk> his house 
 at the core of mr. <unk> 's mancuso is his <unk> <unk> 
 he describes a reporter as miss first amendment 
 he describes a <unk> <unk> as <unk> williams 
 and when he 's told try a little <unk> he <unk> back i 'm going home to try a little <unk> 
 yet for all his <unk> he 's at heart a <unk> <unk> a <unk> with a secret crush on truth justice and the american way 
 he 's the kind of guy who <unk> <unk> flags 
 if mancuso fbi has an intriguing central character it also has a major flaw 
 it 's wildly <unk> 
 executive producers steve sohmer and jeff <unk> and <unk> ken <unk> and steve <unk> have <unk> this show up to the breaking point 
 to start there 's always a crisis and someone always worries what if the press gets a hold of this 
 at least once an episode we see <unk> <unk> around <unk> <unk> 
 at least once mancuso 's boss <unk> in here now and proceeds to dress his investigator down 
 you are a <unk> a <unk> in a $ N suit 
 one more word and you are out on a park bench <unk> 
 finally of course the boss gives in but he 's still <unk> i find myself explaining anything to teddy kennedy you 'll be chasing stolen cars in <unk> 
 in fact throughout mancuso fbi we do n't get words or lines we get <unk> 
 witnesses <unk> <unk> <unk> a dream that the planet could be saved from itself and from the <unk> <unk> creatures who try to <unk> down every decent man who raises his voice 
 and mancuso himself is investigating at the top of his <unk> how the hell can you live with yourself he <unk> at a politician

 you 're the real criminal here and what you did was n't just a murder it was a crime against <unk>

 they have a series with a good character some interesting even occasionally surprising plot lines and they 're <unk> it 
 why when a key witness disappears does mancuso trash her apartment <unk> down <unk> <unk> walls 
 it 's a bizarre and totally inappropriate reaction all to add more <unk> to a script that 's already <unk> on <unk> 
 that 's not plot 
 that 's not character 
 that 's <unk>

 asked to say a few words he pulls out his <unk> piece of paper and tries to talk but he 's too <unk> up to get the words out 
 he <unk> on the piece of paper in frustration then turns and walks away 
 it was a <unk> moving moment for series television and robert <unk> 's acting <unk> in the <unk> 
 there 's a pretty good program inside all the noise of mancuso fbi 
 if the show 's <unk> could just let themselves be quiet for a little they might just hear it 
 with a twist of the <unk> boys with tops and <unk> <unk> and <unk> types with <unk> in their <unk> have a goal in common all of them try to put the right spin on it

 texaco inc. has purchased an <unk> company in texas for $ N million its first major acquisition since its legal <unk> with pennzoil co. began more than four years ago 
 the white plains n.y. oil company said friday that it had acquired <unk> production corp. a subsidiary of <unk> energy holdings inc. for $ N million in cash with the rest to be paid in shares of a new <unk> issue of preferred stock 
 <unk> which holds properties in N oil and gas fields in south texas will provide texaco with mostly gas reserves 
 the fields contain <unk> reserves of N billion cubic feet of natural gas and four million barrels of oil 
 this acquisition is another indication of texaco 's commitment to increase the company 's reserve base said chief executive officer james w. <unk> 
 texaco has also been attempting to sell oil properties 
 at least two years ago the company put N million barrels of oil reserves on the block 
 they were either too small or <unk> to maintain the company said 
 not all of those <unk> have yet been sold 
 texaco acquired <unk> before it completed those sales because <unk> 's properties are high quality and near other fields texaco already owns a company spokeswoman said 
 texaco like many other oil companies has been struggling to replace its falling oil and gas reserves 
 texaco 's situation had become particularly complex because much of its effort had for years been focused on its <unk> with pennzoil and then on new york investor carl c. icahn 's attempt to take over the company 
 pennzoil had sued texaco for improperly <unk> with its acquisition of a portion of <unk> oil co 
 eventually texaco which was forced into bankruptcy proceedings by that litigation settled its fight with pennzoil for $ N billion in N 
 mr. icahn who played a key role in the settlement and attempted subsequently to take control of the company sold his stake in texaco just last summer 
 completion of texaco 's acquisition of <unk> is subject to government approval under the hart-scott-rodino antitrust improvements act 
 <unk> inc. said it reduced the estimated cash distribution for its capital housing and mortgage partners inc. trust to between N cents and N cents a share from between N cents and N cents for the year ending june N N 
 the change in expected cash distributions from the <unk> real estate investment trust stems from a revised estimate of administrative costs said jay r. cohen <unk> executive vice president 
 <unk> which sponsors <unk> is a world-wide real estate investment firm 
 h&r block inc. had net income of $ N million or $ N a share in the fiscal year ended april N

 <unk> ag 's chairman said the belgian insurer is prepared to give up some of its independence to a white knight if necessary to <unk> a raider 
 amid heavy buying of shares in belgium 's largest insurer maurice <unk> also warned in an interview that a white knight in buying out a raider could leave speculators with big losses on their ag stock 
 since the beginning of the year the stock has nearly doubled giving ag a market value of about N billion belgian francs $ N billion 
 the most likely white knight would be societe generale de <unk> s.a. which already owns N N of ag and which itself is controlled by cie financiere de suez the <unk> french financial conglomerate 
 but mr. <unk> said a rescue also could involve <unk> mutual life insurance co. which owns N N of ag 
 ag is hardly alone in its anxiety

 in france suez and <unk> assurances s.a. both have been on the <unk> for giant acquisitions suez last month acquired control of <unk> <unk> the <unk> european insurance company after a takeover battle with cie <unk> 
 mr. <unk> said the volume of shares changing hands has grown significantly since <unk> 
 but he estimated that a raider would have been able to <unk> no more than N N of the shares in recent months 
 aside from exploring plans for joint ventures or acquisitions mr. <unk> has called top managers of companies rumored as potential raiders among them <unk> union des assurances de paris and suez all based in france 
 they have all very clearly stated that they have not acquired and are not acquiring shares of ag he said 
 any raider would find it hard to crack ag 's <unk> 
 a syndicate of shareholders holds just under N N of ag mr. <unk> said and members have agreed to give one another the right of first refusal should they sell any ag shares 
 aside from generale de <unk> and <unk> the syndicate includes <unk> <unk> a belgian savings bank and various family interests 
 a generale spokesman confirmed that the giant belgian holding company would be willing to raise its stake in ag should a raider seek control 
 <unk> officials could n't be reached for comment 
 even without bid talk this year 's surge in prices for brussels real estate has excited interest in ag 
 the company says those holdings constitute the <unk> real-estate portfolio in belgium 
 with the dust settling from the failed coup attempt in panama one of the many <unk> questions the bush administration will <unk> is this is the national security council staff big enough and does it have enough clout to do its job of <unk> foreign policy 
 president bush 's national security adviser <unk> gen. <unk> scowcroft came into office in january intent on making the nsc staff <unk> and more disciplined than it had been during the reagan administration 
 gen. scowcroft was a member of the tower commission which investigated the iran-contra affair 
 he was all too aware of how a large <unk> <unk> nsc staff had spun out of control and nearly <unk> president reagan 's second term 
 so following both the style he pursued as president ford 's national security adviser and the recommendations of the tower commission gen. scowcroft has <unk> the nsc staff and tried to ensure that it <unk> to its assigned tasks namely gathering the views of the state department pentagon and intelligence community serving as an honest broker in <unk> that information for the president and then making sure presidential decisions are carried out 
 the tower commission specifically said that the nsc staff should be small and warned against letting energetic <unk> like <unk> col. oliver north strike out on their own rather than leaving the day-to-day execution of policies to the state department pentagon or central intelligence agency 
 however the panama episode has raised questions about whether the nsc staff is sufficiently big diverse and powerful to coordinate u.s. policy on tough issues 
 during the coup attempt and its aftermath nsc staffers were stretched very thin says one senior administration official 
 it 's a very small shop 
 gen. scowcroft does n't plan to increase the staff right now but is weighing that possibility the official adds 
 the nsc staff does n't have the <unk> that i believe is required to have an effective <unk> process says frank <unk> a former pentagon aide who now runs the center for security policy a conservative washington <unk> 
 the problem with this administration i think is that by design it has greatly diminished both in a physical sense and in a procedural sense the role of the nsc 
 the national security council itself was established in N because policy makers <unk> a need in an increasingly complex world for a formal system within the white house to make sure that communications <unk> smoothly between the president and the state department pentagon and intelligence agencies 
 by law the council includes the president vice president and secretaries of state and defense 
 in practice the director of central intelligence and chairman of the joint chiefs of staff also serve as <unk> members 
 but the size shape and role of the nsc staff have been left for each president and his national security adviser to decide 
 that task is one of washington 's <unk> problems 
 in the bush white house the size of the nsc 's staff of professional officers is down to about N from about N in N administration officials say 
 administration officials insist that the size of the staff was n't a problem during the panama crisis 
 but one clear problem during the coup attempt was that the nsc <unk> most experienced in latin america <unk> briggs was gone 
 he had just resigned at least in part because of a <unk> with assistant secretary of state bernard <unk> over the administration 's policy on panama and support for nicaragua 's contra rebels 
 the absence of mr. briggs underscored the possible <unk> of the current nsc staff 
 both gen. scowcroft and his deputy robert gates are experts in u.s.-soviet affairs 
 gen. scowcroft is particularly <unk> in arms control and mr. gates has spent years studying soviet politics and society 
 both have become <unk> of president bush 
 but neither has an extensive background in latin america the middle east or asia 
 in those areas the role of nsc staffers under them therefore have become more important 
 gen. scowcroft knows as well as anyone that one of the biggest dangers he faces is that nsc staffers working in relative <unk> will take over <unk> and operational tasks that are best left to bigger and more experienced state department and pentagon bureaus 
 but just as every previous nsc adviser has gen. scowcroft now will have to <unk> at what point the nsc staff becomes too lean and too <unk>

 frank lavelle who at the time was the marketing director for sperry in <unk> fla. admitted participating in a scheme to bribe <unk> <unk> the navy official 
 mr. <unk> who left the navy in N pleaded guilty earlier this year to related conspiracy bribery and <unk> charges 
 the bribery scheme took place between N and N according to documents filed by prosecutors in connection with mr. lavelle 's guilty plea in federal district court in <unk> va 
 sperry merged with <unk> corp. to become unisys corp. in late N 
 court documents filed by prosecutors indicate mr. <unk> tried to steer to sperry a <unk> dollar contract to <unk> maintenance of certain navy electronics <unk> 
 mr. <unk> among other things illegally provided mr. lavelle with inside information and documents intended to give sperry an unfair advantage in the competition the documents said 
 sperry ultimately was eliminated from the competition without receiving the work 
 documents filed by prosecutors also indicate that mr. lavelle and his fellow <unk> requested and obtained approval of the scheme from <unk> sperry officials because the payment which <unk> <unk> requested was so large 
 charles <unk> a former unisys vice president and james neal a former company consultant have admitted participating in this and other bribery schemes

 he <unk> the contest on larry king 's radio show on pat <unk> 's television show and on the <unk> cable television network 
 he talked about it in every speech he made as he <unk> the country promoting his books which <unk> handy <unk> advice on using government information for fun and profit 
 mr. lesko figured he would be flooded with <unk> by now 
 after all he says we 've got like N million bureaucrats 
 and in addition to the $ N he has promised the winner a my favorite bureaucrat <unk> and offered each of two <unk> $ N 
 so far though mr. lesko has received only one entry 
 to make matters worse the lone nomination came from another bureaucrat a woman from the new york state department of taxation and finance who <unk> her boss 
 mr. lesko who is making the rules as he goes has determined that bureaucrats are eligible for nomination by other bureaucrats 
 but he says he would prefer to get <unk> from <unk> folks 
 he admits that he has n't had much luck generating free publicity for his contest 
 newspapers including this one have generally ignored his news releases 
 talk show hosts quickly change the topic 
 but mr. lesko 's staff is beginning to wonder whether there is n't some larger phenomenon <unk> the contest 
 is the government not helping anybody asks <unk> murray an assistant to mr. lesko 
 mr. lesko himself is n't yet prepared to accept that explanation 
 people hate to write he says 
 maybe people do n't believe i want to give this money away 
 maybe americans are just so <unk> with government that they are n't interested in admitting that bureaucrats come in handy once in a while 
 if he sponsored a contest on how a bureaucrat <unk> something mr. lesko admits i 'd get N <unk>

 ford motor co. and saab-scania ab of sweden broke off talks about a possible alliance after ford officials concluded that the cost to modernize saab 's car operations would outweigh the likely return 
 with the collapse of the talks friday european analysts expect ford to intensify its pursuit of british luxury car maker jaguar plc which is scrambling to fend off a hostile ford bid by negotiating a friendly alliance with ford 's archrival general motors corp 
 saab meanwhile is left to continue its search for an ally to shore up its sagging car business 
 saab said last week it has had and will continue to have contacts with other manufacturers 
 among the possible suitors is italy 's fiat s.p a analysts said last week 
 ford and saab officials declined to elaborate publicly on the announcement friday that their negotiations failed to yield an agreement that could make long-term business sense to both parties 
 individuals close to the ford side of the negotiations said late last week that the no. N u.s. auto maker lost interest as it became clear that the swedish auto maker 's automotive operations had little to offer in the way of image or technology 
 ford originally had seen a saab alliance as a way to expand its presence in the european and u.s. luxury car markets 
 in addition ford and saab had discussed a possible link between their heavy truck operations 
 but the talks on a heavy truck alliance apparently did n't go far 
 some european analysts speculated that officials of saab 's highly profitable <unk> truck operation balked at <unk> any of their <unk> 
 meanwhile ford officials became convinced they could n't expect to recover the investment it would require to make saab 's cars competitive in the increasingly crowded luxury market 
 saab 's problems were underscored friday when the company announced that its car division had a N billion kronor $ N million loss during the first eight months of this year slightly worse than saab-scania had forecast in its first-half report last month 
 overall saab-scania 's pretax profit during the first eight months of the year plunged N N to N billion swedish kronor $ N million from N billion kronor $ N million a year earlier 
 industry analysts in europe said the most likely suitor for saab now is fiat 
 saab and fiat have worked together in the past in one case developing jointly a new auto <unk> that became the foundation of saab 's N model fiat 's <unk> and <unk> 's <unk> 
 last month saab-scania chief executive <unk> <unk> said his company has had talks with fiat about a broader alliance 
 but the talks yielded nothing so advanced that we needed to make a public announcement about it he said 
 as for ford analysts expect the end of the saab play will allow the u.s. auto maker to focus its resources on the <unk> struggle with gm for a stake in jaguar 
 the failure of the saab talks makes it even more crucial for ford to be <unk> in the jaguar contest said stephen reitman european auto industry analyst at <unk> & drew in london 
 ford faces an <unk> fight for jaguar however 
 jaguar executives said last week they expect to have a friendly alliance with gm <unk> up by the end of the month 
 gm meanwhile is <unk> a delegation of members of the british parliament who are <unk> the auto maker 's <unk> operations in detroit 
 a gm spokesman said the visit is n't connected to the jaguar situation 
 but ford clearly views jaguar as a prize worth fighting for since the company 's <unk> brand image would give ford a badly needed leg up in the high end of the luxury markets in both europe and the u.s. 
 last week ford encountered a setback in its effort to broaden its u.s. luxury offerings when it was forced to abandon a four-year-old effort to market its <unk> scorpio sedan in the u.s. as a luxury import under the merkur brand name 
 so despite the <unk> <unk> analysts say ford by last friday had boosted its jaguar holding to about N N of the luxury auto maker 's shares outstanding from N N early last week 
 about N million jaguar shares changed hands in active trading on london 's stock exchange friday and jaguar shares moved up N pence to N pence $ N 
 on the u.s. over-the-counter market jaguar 's american depositary receipts rose N cents to $ N

 the dallas cowboys are looking at a <unk> situation struggling to pull ahead of the atlanta <unk> 
 up in his stadium box their new and controversial owner <unk> jerry jones watches <unk> as the team <unk> up to the <unk> line 
 mr. jones takes heart 
 there in the center of the pack is <unk> <unk> <unk> the key to the cowboys ' comeback strategy 
 so key in fact that mr. jones signed him in april for $ N million over the next six years a record for a <unk> 
 he 's a genuine <unk> <unk> <unk> mr. jones 
 with three minutes left on the <unk> mr. <unk> takes the <unk> steps back and fires a <unk> pass straight into the hands of an atlanta defensive back 
 the crowd <unk> mr. jones <unk> his head the cowboys lose the game 
 a few days after that sept. N game mr. <unk> broke a finger <unk> him for weeks 
 <unk> the <unk> of professional sports 
 for mr. jones losing his <unk> temporarily was just the latest in a string of setbacks that has <unk> the dallas cowboys and this year much of the national football league 
 once fat and happy the cowboys now are losing games fans and money 
 last year the team ended up $ N million in the red on $ N million in revenue 
 it has some of the highest costs in the league 
 its attendance is off N N from six years ago 
 at the very least mr. jones who <unk> the society circuit as <unk> as his bench can take comfort in one fact these days he is n't alone 
 nearly half the owners of the N national football league teams are losing money the result of flat attendance aging stadiums and more than anything <unk> salaries for star players like mr. <unk> 
 last year the top N players on each nfl team took home an average $ N a figure comparable to baseball and higher than in basketball 
 <unk> draft picks have done even better average salaries and bonuses for them rose to $ N this year up N N from N 
 it 's a vicious circle says art <unk> owner of the cleveland <unk> 
 one team pays so much and the other pays more 
 we just do n't have that kind of income stream 
 all this is causing <unk> in professional football 
 owners largely <unk> in the past are now almost desperately looking for ways to lower costs and raise revenue <unk> some revolutionary ideas in the process 
 though not intentionally the cowboys ' mr. jones has come to represent this new breed of owner 
 shortly after buying N N of the team from <unk> <unk> bright for $ N million and <unk> of the cowboys ' <unk> bottom line the <unk> mr. jones set about his own round of team cuts 
 first he <unk> <unk> tom <unk> the legendary coach who took the cowboys to five <unk> <unk> and N consecutive winning seasons 
 in dallas mr. <unk> has a standing just shy of <unk> 
 <unk> sentiment flooded the local press a crude <unk> <unk> said one writer a real <unk> said another who in the hell does he think he is wrote a third 
 for mr. jones it was just the beginning 
 he quickly cut the team 's bloated administrative staff by half shut down a <unk> dance academy and in july announced plans to sell valley ranch the team 's <unk> practice camp and the most <unk> training facility in the nfl 
 mr. jones calls the ranch the pentagon of <unk> 
 it is a <unk> of halls that <unk> film rooms elaborate <unk> and <unk> centers that testify to a richer more <unk> era 
 he likes to tell the <unk> of how he got lost on the <unk> ranch during an early visit took refuge in an office and called the front desk for help 
 i said somebody come get me 
 i 'm at extension N 
 with a new day <unk> on the sport mr. jones does n't see a place for this sort of luxury 
 it 's just not cost efficient he says 
 the place costs nearly $ N million a year to maintain 
 when he sells it he says the cowboys will move to a more practical read affordable <unk> practice field near texas stadium 
 and as for tom <unk> well in mr. jones 's mind he had played out his winning years 
 after posting losing seasons in each of the last three years the cowboys needed a change he says 
 football has long been mr. jones 's passion both on and off the field 
 an arkansas native he started at guard on the <unk> N university of arkansas team that won a national championship 
 after college he worked at his father 's insurance company in little rock and in N led an aborted attempt to buy the san diego <unk> 
 years later with cash from the sale of the insurance company he founded <unk> production corp. an oil and gas exploration company based in little rock 
 so it was n't surprising that mr. jones returned to his arkansas roots when he went looking for a replacement for mr. <unk> 
 he tapped <unk> johnson a <unk> on the N university of arkansas <unk> and the head coach at the university of miami where he led the <unk> to five winning seasons and a national championship in N 
 whatever mr. johnson 's <unk> in the hearts and minds of many dallas fans he is no tom <unk> 
 seven games and after a loss to the kansas city chiefs yesterday seven losses into the season the new cowboys are n't doing any better than the old 
 in fact the last time they played this badly was in N their opening season 
 average attendance at their games about N last year continues flat 
 mr. jones is attacking the problem on several fronts 
 he continues to <unk> the team trading <unk> running back <unk> walker to the minnesota <unk> this month for a slew of players and future draft picks 
 to try to draw more fans he has dropped <unk> ticket prices from $ N to $ N 
 but the general trend given rising costs in the league has been to raise prices and mr. jones is expected to eventually follow suit 
 it 's simple says <unk> hunt who owns the kansas city chiefs and last year raised ticket prices by $ N to an average $ N 
 if we did n't increase prices we 'd be in the red 
 mr. jones has also <unk> up his marketing staff to sell the N luxury suites <unk> texas stadium his deal with <unk> bright included operating rights for the stadium 
 the suites are <unk> have <unk> bars and <unk> <unk> and offer a clear view of the field all for a sale price of $ N to $ N million depending on their size and location 
 mr. jones has been taking prospective <unk> owners onto the field during practice to let them <unk> <unk> with players and promises those who actually buy one of the rooms an insider 's look at the team 's strategy before game time 
 the sales job seems to be paying off when he bought the team only six of the suites had been sold 
 today N have 
 gate receipts are only the cowboys ' second largest source of cash 
 the biggest is the nfl 's contract with national television for broadcast of the league 's games 
 last year the cowboys ' share of that pie came to $ N million 
 the team additionally earns between $ N million and $ N million for local radio and television broadcast rights 
 mr. jones is currently trying to jack up the price for those local rights 
 he is also trying to get more stations in mexico where the cowboys have a following to pick up the games 
 mr. jones whose <unk> voice and <unk> ways <unk> an intense businessman who works <unk> days is resigned to the hefty salaries he pays his players these days 
 he calls the contracts critical to winning in the nfl and has played his part in the bidding wars 
 besides signing mr. <unk> to a sizable contract mr. jones has agreed to pay <unk> <unk> steve <unk> $ N million over the next four years 
 this wage inflation is bleeding the nfl dry the owners contend 
 soon only large corporations will be able to afford to buy and run football teams predicts john j. <unk> jr. an investment banker with salomon brothers who handled the cowboys sale 
 to tackle the problem nfl owners have proposed setting a <unk> wage scale to try to rein in salaries 
 details of the plan which would go into effect in N are <unk> but each player would apparently be paid a base salary <unk> to his position and ability 
 bonuses would be paid based on playing time and performance 
 the nfl players association meanwhile contends that athletes are paid a wage <unk> with their ability to draw fans and that some owners are in financial trouble because of poor business management not players ' salaries 
 the owners are trying to boost profit in other ways too 
 many have launched promotions to attract new fans and are <unk> dated stadium contracts 
 most of the owners must pay up to N N of gross ticket sales for leases on stadiums they say are either too small or too old 
 in chicago for example size is the issue 
 we have the worst lease in the nfl contends michael b. <unk> the president of the chicago bears and a <unk> of george <unk> who founded the nfl 's predecessor organization 
 we 're in a <unk> area with millions of bear fans and only a small number can be <unk> 
 when the lease expires in N he says it 's got to be changed 
 this year the nfl also imposed an <unk> limit on teams going into training camp down from N in a move meant to trim payroll costs 
 and the league is trying to get more for its three-year national network contract which expires after this season 
 the current contract pays the nfl $ N billion 
 owners say they expect the league to demand a N N increase despite the fact that televised football games have had lackluster ratings 
 an nfl spokesman also says the league will probably expand its offerings to cable tv companies like espn 
 the changes have n't come easy 
 like the game of professional football the nfl organization itself is in turmoil 
 the new breed of team owner mr. jones included has been fighting the nfl bureaucracy for a greater say in league affairs and the battle has produced a form of <unk> gridlock 
 in july N nfl owners almost all of them new blocked an effort to install jim <unk> as a replacement for retiring league commissioner pete <unk> 
 mr. <unk> is perceived by some owners as a <unk> for the old guard 
 earlier this month another effort to choose a commissioner failed 
 the owners meet again tomorrow 
 for his part jerry jones says he 's in the business for the long haul and his work style seems to support that 
 he puts in busy <unk> weeks excluding game days and on one recent afternoon <unk> questions in the course of an hour from a tv producer his <unk> marketing manager a <unk> customer and a <unk> of arkansas reporters 
 to keep his schedule on track he flies two personal secretaries in from little rock to <unk> his staff in dallas 
 when i made this investment i made it on a lifetime basis he explains 
 i 'm not here to make money by <unk> the team later on 
 while the cowboys may not be the best investment now i do n't accept they ca n't be in the future 
 besides to a large extent mr. jones may already be getting what he wants out of the team even though it keeps losing 
 owning the cowboys has bought him <unk> to a <unk> life that drilling for oil in arkansas just did n't provide 
 there is the new private jet the <unk> of <unk> <unk> to the best parties and television appearances on shows such as prime time live 
 a few weeks ago mr. jones even <unk> elizabeth taylor in his private <unk> at texas stadium 
 you 're in the <unk> seat every day in this job he says 
 how <unk> <unk> of robert goldberg to use the form of <unk> <unk> journalism to explain his perception of days of rage in his television <unk> leisure & arts <unk> N 
 he <unk> <unk> <unk> for her <unk> presentation of <unk> journalism judging her project as <unk> <unk> 
 was not the title very clear 
 one example he gives she did n't ask why the palestinian children are soldiers throwing stones 
 really now did she have to ask 
 were not the pictures and <unk> which have been continuing news <unk> answers enough 
 mr. goldberg contends that even as propaganda the film fails because it presents only one view 
 of course the <unk> complain about their treatment of course the <unk> feel put upon 
 but his complaint that days of rage does n't contain balanced comments from <unk> about how badly the <unk> are <unk> is irrelevant 
 it 's like doing a <unk> on apartheid and insisting that equal time be given to how <unk> white south <unk> are 
 this film did <unk> how long the <unk> <unk> has existed by <unk> the conflict to the days of world war i when the british tried to guarantee both a jewish state and a palestinian state without <unk> how it was to be done 
 well days of rage airing with <unk> packaging and after repeated delays was a beginning 
 every issue is <unk> 
 this film attempts to show a side rarely seen in our media 
 now we must endure a rash of critics who apparently wish to know details of one side only

 president bush wants the pentagon to get special treatment in coping with the across-the-board spending cuts that took effect last week 
 mr. bush asked congress to raise to $ N billion from $ N billion the amount of money defense secretary dick cheney may shift among the pentagon 's individual programs projects and activities allowing him to ease the pain that the gramm-rudman budget law was intended to <unk> 
 if the request is approved by both the house and senate mr. cheney would need only permission from the white house office of management and budget to move the money according to senate budget analysts 
 that would give the pentagon flexibility that no other federal agency has 
 it 's simply a way of making the cuts less onerous for defense than they are for domestic programs said chairman james <unk> d. <unk> of the senate budget committee who said he would oppose the request 
 that is n't consistent with the kind of discipline that gramm-rudman is supposed to impose he said 
 the president 's request did n't indicate how mr. cheney would shift the money 
 a pentagon official said the request was made to give the department maximum flexibility to deal with the cuts 
 last week budget director richard darman structured the $ N billion spending reduction half of which must come from defense to impose a little bit more discipline by applying cuts to each individual program project or activity in the budget 
 that would give agencies less ability to <unk> over things he told reporters 
 under the deficit-reduction law N N of the pentagon 's money and N N of other agencies ' money has been canceled 
 lawmakers are expected to try to restore the funds once a pending <unk> measure has been signed into law

 rochester telephone said the acquisition was made in an exchange of its common shares for all the shares of urban telephone but a price was n't disclosed 
 urban is the company 's first telephone subsidiary in wisconsin 
 since june rochester telephone signed letters of intent to purchase three other wisconsin firms 
 a bill that would permit the securities and exchange commission to monitor the financial condition of securities firms ' holding companies is facing tough opposition from some wall street firms which argue that the legislation is unnecessary 
 the legislation and other issues related to the stock market will be the focus of hearings this week by the house telecommunications and finance subcommittee and the senate securities subcommittee 
 richard breeden the new chairman of the sec has n't taken a formal position on the bill which would also require investors to disclose large trades and give the sec additional authority during market <unk> 
 however he recently told the senate banking committee that he believes the agency should have explicit authority to monitor debt levels at holding companies and affiliates of <unk> which are frequently used to issue bridge loans 
 the bridge loans are intended to provide temporary financing for acquisitions 
 since such loans are often <unk> through the sale of high-risk high-yield junk bonds the recent woes of the junk-bond market have renewed concerns among regulators about the risks associated with wall street firms issuing bridge loans 
 but some wall street executives argue that such fears are unwarranted 
 in a july N letter to the senate securities subcommittee first boston corp. argued that the fact that no retail brokerage firm failed during the N market crash demonstrates that current rules are adequate 
 first boston whose holding company cs first boston group is one of the larger issuers of bridge loans on wall street said it is also concerned that once the sec has the power to monitor holding companies it will try to regulate their activities 
 the proposal while <unk> i think can be <unk> misleading because the likely consequence would be to weaken rather than strengthen the control the sec has exercised for N years over the financial <unk> and viability of <unk> michael <unk> managing director of first boston said in an interview 
 the bill would <unk> scarce resources of the commission away from <unk> into areas which simply have no way of affecting <unk> mr. <unk> said 
 sources in the industry and on capitol hill say a compromise that would <unk> the industry while addressing the sec 's concerns may be possible 
 an aide to the senate securities subcommittee says some legislators support the concept of risk disclosure but adds nobody is <unk> to the language in the bill 
 edward o'brien president of the securities industry association said that the <unk> trade group opposes the bill as it is written but that it is hopeful a compromise can be reached to achieve the sec 's goals 
 mr. o'brien will elaborate on the <unk> 's position in testimony before the house telecommunications and finance subcommittee this week a spokesman said 
 this letter was inspired by david <unk> 's sept. N editorial-page article about <unk> <unk> man in the middle of drug trafficking 
 i 've organized a series of exchanges <unk> and other continuing projects between cuban and american artists 
 in any matters between us and the cubans there can be no <unk> consequently i 've become familiar not only with cuban art and artists but also with cuban bureaucrats and their counterparts in our own government 
 despite levels of <unk> <unk> and <unk> frustration of <unk> proportion these projects all remain in my mind valuable and well worth the effort 
 there is a simple reason for this the cuban people 
 let me immediately put limits to whatever <unk> <unk> that may intimate 
 those people to whom i refer are not some <unk> <unk> quantity they are artists critics taxi drivers <unk> even some employees of the ministry of culture all of whom share a deep belief in the original principles of the cuban revolution <unk> out in terms such as <unk> among all members of the society <unk> for education and creative expression universal rights to health and <unk> housing etc 
 in fact the generation of <unk> growing into maturity right now works with such <unk> held <unk> assumptions and such <unk> commitment to moral and ethical principles that it makes <unk> <unk> 's famous <unk> of art <unk> and revolution seem modest 
 it is on behalf of these people and out of my real respect for them that i am responding to mr. <unk> 's opinions of their country 
 the <unk> trial in july with its <unk> of deeply rooted and widespread corruption and the summary trial and execution was extremely disturbing to everyone who has ever considered himself a friend of cuba 
 however <unk> though those <unk> may have been they still provide no excuse for wholesale departures from truth 
 mr. <unk> should make <unk> among <unk> the army and the cuban people 
 they are not <unk> since they are motivated to act based on their own circumstances 
 it is <unk> to <unk> a government 's policies with the will of the people as we well know and it is even worse <unk> to merge the clearly <unk> <unk> of <unk> and the military and the state bureaucracy 
 mr. <unk> is also <unk> that mr. <unk> has resisted collaboration with u.s. officials even though by his own account that collaboration has been devised essentially as a mechanism for acts directly hostile to the cuban regime such as <unk> <unk> 
 i think it 's a little <unk> to be surprised that <unk> does n't <unk> the u.s. state department to violate the jurisdiction of the cuban government over its own territory 
 we badly need to follow fact rather than the rhetoric of conventional wisdom 
 without this basic level of attention to reality our policies on cuba will continue to be as <unk> as they have for N years 
 from my own point of view given the <unk> of <unk> creativity and warm spirit in which the cuban people <unk> we deny ourselves access to things we hold <unk> and which seem to run in such short supply these days 
 there is no rational <unk> for such behavior 
 <unk> weiss <unk> mass 
 <unk> inc. recently reported third-quarter earnings which were mistakenly shown in the quarterly earnings surprises table in last tuesday 's edition to be lower than the average of analysts ' estimates 
 <unk> investment research did n't adjust one analyst 's estimate for a stock split which therefore was artificially high 
 <unk> 's third-quarter net income of N cents a share actually was N N higher than the adjusted average of estimates 
 investors <unk> out of new york city bonds in <unk> last week driving prices lower and boosting yields 
 one bond trader estimated that more than $ N million of new york city general obligation bonds were put up for sale friday alone 
 while that represents a small percentage of the city 's public debt outstanding friday 's selling followed a <unk> effort to unload the bonds by a broad spectrum of institutional and individual investors 
 i 've never seen so many new york city <unk> 's up for sale said another trader 
 every broker has blocks of every size and maturity 
 municipal bond analysts said the sell-off was triggered by concerns about the city 's financial health rumors of a $ N million bond offering coming soon and political uncertainty 
 a spokesman for the city would n't confirm the size of the bond issue but did say that a general obligation offering is in the works and should be priced sometime in the next two weeks before the november mayoral election 
 general obligation bonds are backed by the city 's overall revenues and credit 
 although many investors were aware that a bond offering was being scheduled many expected a much smaller amount of bonds to be sold 
 the fact that the city will issue such a large amount of debt was interpreted as a sign that new york 's budgetary problems are more serious than had been expected 
 new york one of the nation 's largest issuers of tax-exempt bonds sold $ N million of municipal bonds just a few weeks ago 
 there have been reports for months that the city 's economy is weakening as the october N stock market crash continues to make itself felt 
 the recent sharp stock market decline <unk> those concerns 
 meanwhile tax revenues are falling while the city 's spending needs are expanding 
 rumors <unk> last week that new york 's credit ratings single-a from moody 's investors service inc. and <unk> from standard & poor 's corp. are at risk 
 the weakness in new york city bonds follows a warning from new york state comptroller edward <unk> that the N crash seriously weakened the city 's economy 
 in a study the comptroller said the city 's glory days are over 
 mr. <unk> warned mayoral candidates to be prepared for limited options and constraints on service increases to address the city 's problems in the next few years due to the <unk> weakening in the new york city economy 
 new york city 's revised financial plan due out later this month is expected to include measures to balance the city 's $ N billion budget 
 at present analysts project a budget gap on the order of $ N million to $ N million for the fiscal year ending june N N although the city 's own budget analysts project a narrower deficit 
 mark page new york 's deputy director of finance said that investors ' concerns about the city 's financial health are unwarranted given our proven ability to manage ourselves 
 he charges the city 's critics with spreading <unk> emotional rhetoric 
 there are also questions about whether a new and <unk> mayor can manage the city through what could become a financial crisis 
 the leading <unk> for the mayoral office democrat david dinkins has been criticized recently for the way he handled his personal financial affairs 
 and the controversy has led to uncertainty about the outcome of the election 
 until last week mr. dinkins was considered a <unk> 
 the market can adjust to good news or bad news but uncertainty drives people wild said bernard b. <unk> chief executive of <unk> <unk> & co. a securities firm that specializes in the municipal market 
 until last week everyone felt certain they knew the outcome of the election 
 now there have been a number of questions raised 
 last week yields on long-term new york city general obligation bonds jumped half a percentage point 
 new york city 's N N bonds due N for example were quoted late friday at a price to yield N N compared with N N thursday 
 as the yield on new york general obligation bonds rose the bond buyer <unk> general obligation index the mostly widely followed gauge of the tax-exempt market held steady at N N in the week ended oct. N 
 qintex australia ltd. encountered another setback friday when its los angeles-based affiliate qintex entertainment inc. filed for protection under chapter N of the u.s. bankruptcy code 
 qintex entertainment also said david evans its president and chief executive and roger <unk> a director both resigned 
 neither could be reached for comment 
 earlier this month qintex australia 's $ N billion agreement to acquire mgm\/ua communications co. collapsed because of a dispute over a $ N million letter of credit the australian operator of television stations and resorts was to have supplied as security in the transaction 
 mr. evans had been the de <unk> head of mgm\/ua for months 
 qintex entertainment a producer and distributor of television programs most noted for its <unk> of the hit <unk> <unk> <unk> said it filed for chapter N protection after qintex australia failed to provide it with $ N million owed to mca inc. in connection with the distribution of the new leave it to <unk> show 
 qintex entertainment is N N owned by qintex australia and said it relies on the australian company for funding its working capital requirements 
 after the announcement of the bankruptcy filing qintex entertainment stock sank $ N in over-the-counter trading to close at $ N on heavy volume of more than N million shares 
 the stock traded as high as $ N this past summer 
 jonathan lloyd executive vice president and chief financial officer of qintex entertainment said qintex entertainment was forced to file for protection to avoid going into default under its agreement with mca 
 the $ N million payment was due oct. N and the deadline for default was oct. N 
 mr. lloyd said if qintex had defaulted it could have been required to repay $ N million in debt under its loan agreements 
 mca on friday said that as a result of qintex 's failure to make the required payment it was <unk> the distribution agreement on the new leave it to <unk> as well as other mca properties 
 qintex australia was saying as recently as last weekend that they would take care of the situation 
 they continued to represent that to the board said mr. lloyd 
 we were <unk> they would stand behind the company 
 mr. lloyd said both qintex entertainment and qintex australia had attempted to secure a loan that would allow the company to make the $ N million payment but the request was turned down by an unidentified lender on oct. N 
 at that point he said qintex australia stated it would <unk> to arrange the financing 
 however a qintex australia spokesman said his firm had never promised or guaranteed to make the payment 
 in a prepared statement from australia the company also said that following the breakdown of the mgm talks it had been <unk> its position as a significant shareholder and a substantial creditor of qintex entertainment and had resolved to minimize the degree of further loans to qintex entertainment in excess of that previously made 
 the qintex australia spokesman added that his company had opposed the chapter N filing 
 he said the company believed qintex entertainment 's financial problems could have been resolved by other means 
 the report of the bankruptcy filing stunned hollywood executives and investors 
 it 's a <unk> said joseph di <unk> chairman of <unk> capital securities a brokerage firm that has an investment in qintex entertainment 
 qintex australia was going to pay more than $ N billion for mgm\/ua and then they could n't come up with the far smaller sum of $ N million 
 qintex said mr. evans the former president resigned for personal reasons and that mr. <unk> an attorney resigned because his participation in evaluating the company 's role in buying mgm\/ua was no longer necessary 
 mr. <unk> was a director of the company and a predecessor firm since N 
 the announcement seemed to further damp prospects that talks between qintex australia and mgm\/ua might be revived 
 it 's understood that mgm\/ua recently contacted rupert murdoch 's news corp. which made two failed bids for the movie studio to see if the company was still interested 
 however we are n't currently doing anything 
 it is n't a current topic of conversation at the company said barry <unk> chairman and chief executive officer of the fox inc. unit of news corp 
 financial printer <unk> & co. said it formed a business translation service which will provide legal financial and other services in most major <unk> including japanese chinese and russian 
 japan 's finance ministry strongly denied playing any role in the new york <unk> free fall 
 <unk> utsumi vice minister for international affairs said the ministry did n't in any way suggest to japanese banks that they stay out of the ual corp. leveraged buy-out 
 the ministry has never even suggested that japanese banks be cautious about leveraged buy-outs in general mr. utsumi said 
 there are no facts behind the <unk> that we sent any kind of signal he declared in an interview 
 the comments were the ministry 's first detailed public statement on the subject and reflect the ministry 's concern that foreigners will think japan is using its tremendous financial power to control events in foreign markets 
 a number of accounts of the events leading to the N point drop in new york stock prices on oct. N accused the ministry of pulling the plug on the ual deal for one reason or another 
 mr. utsumi said the most the ministry had ever done was ask japanese banks about the status of their participation in one previous u.s. leveraged buy-out 
 the ministry <unk> about that deal which mr. utsumi declined to identify because the large presence of japanese banks in the deal was being strongly criticized in the u.s. congress and it was necessary for us to grasp the situation 
 he said the inquiry was n't made in a way that the banks could have interpreted as either encouraging or discouraging participation and he added that none of the japanese banks changed their posture on the deal as a result of the inquiry 
 mr. utsumi also said some japanese banks were willing to participate in the ual financing up to the very end which would suggest at the very least that they were n't under orders to back out 
 in general mr. utsumi said japanese banks are becoming more independent in their approach to overseas deals 
 each japanese bank has its own judgment on the profits and risks in that ual deal he said 
 they are becoming more independent 
 it 's a sound phenomenon 
 <unk> bank ltd. is one japanese bank that decided not to participate in the first ual proposal 
 a <unk> bank spokesman denied that the finance ministry played any part in the bank 's decision 
 we made our own decision he said 
 still mr. utsumi may have a hard time convincing market analysts who have <unk> or <unk> believed that the ministry played a role in <unk> recent moves by japanese banks 
 all week there has been much speculation in financial circles in tokyo and abroad about the ministry 's real position 
 bank analysts say ministry officials have been growing increasingly concerned during the past few months about japanese banks getting in over their heads 
 the ministry thinks the banks do n't know what they are doing that they have very little idea how to cope with risk said one foreign bank analyst who asked not to be identified 
 the ministry wants to see the japanese banks pull in their <unk> on leveraged buy-outs he added 
 although some of the japanese banks involved in the first proposed bid for ual bowed out because they found the terms <unk> observers here say they have a hard time <unk> that commercial considerations were the only reason 
 japanese banks are under political pressure as well the analyst said 
 moreover analysts point out that japanese banks have a reputation for doing deals that are n't extremely profitable if they offer the chance to build market share cement an important business relationship or curry favor with powerful bureaucrats 
 clearly some financial authorities are concerned about the japanese banks role in leveraged buy-outs 
 at a news conference this week bank of japan gov. <unk> <unk> cautioned banks to take a prudent stance regarding highly leveraged deals 
 despite mr. <unk> 's statements it is the finance ministry not the central bank that makes policy decisions 
 while recent events may cool some of the leveraged buy-out fever japanese banks are n't likely to walk away from the game 
 despite the risks the deals can be an attractive way for japanese banks to increase their presence in the u.s. market bank analysts say 
 flush with cash at home but with fewer customers to lend to leading banks are eager to expand overseas 
 jumping in on big deals is a high profile way to <unk> the problem of not having a strong <unk> network 
 france 's national tobacco company known for making <unk> cigarettes such as <unk> and <unk> is <unk> out 
 concerned by <unk> demand for its traditional products it is moving not only into <unk> cigarettes but also into electronic <unk> payment cards to be sold in neighborhood tobacco stores 
 brown tobacco in france is a more <unk> stronger grade than the lighter grade or <unk> tobacco used in so-called <unk> cigarettes 
 we are n't philip morris cos. says <unk> de <unk> chairman of government-owned societe <unk> <unk> <unk> des <unk> & <unk> s.a. known as seita 
 he says that because seita 's profits are limited by <unk> cigarette prices he does n't have the cash to diversify as heavily into food and drink as the u.s. concern has done 
 last year for example seita 's net profit soared N N to N million french francs $ N million on sales of <unk> N billion a N N profit margin 
 instead he said in an interview he is looking for ways to exploit france 's network of N tobacco agents most of them <unk> 
 while seita does n't own the french <unk> its close alliance with them offers distribution possibilities 
 one proposal is to introduce a new payment system for parking in paris 
 instead of paying for parking by putting money in the existing machines which deliver little paper receipts drivers would be able to buy electronic cards in local tobacco shops 
 once <unk> the card would sit in the car 's window showing traffic <unk> how much time the <unk> could remain 
 when the <unk> returned to his car he could turn the card off and if it showed time remaining save it for later 
 seita is a partner in the project which was developed by <unk> <unk> using japanese technology 
 seita and <unk> currently are negotiating with city officials for the right to begin service 
 and seita is considering further diversification 
 it wanted to buy rjr nabisco inc. 's french <unk> subsidiary <unk> in hopes of selling its products in tobacco stores but lost the bidding to food group bsn <unk> 
 it currently is considering bidding for swedish match co 
 and it retains an interest in acquiring <unk> and other articles that might be sold in tobacco shops 
 it also is trying to shore up its tobacco business 
 <unk> cigarettes such as <unk> now make up just N N of the french tobacco market half the level of about two decades ago 
 while seita retains a manufacturing monopoly in france it is being hurt by rising imports and from <unk> cigarette demand 
 so seita has introduced <unk> cigarettes under the <unk> label and intends to <unk> the unsuccessful <unk> <unk> in new packaging similar to the <unk> used by <unk> <unk> 
 the aim says mr. de <unk> is to win market share from imported cigarettes and to persuade smokers who are switching to <unk> cigarettes to keep buying french 
 when the supreme court upheld missouri 's abortion restrictions last july the justices almost certainly did n't have drunk driving <unk> and false <unk> on their minds 
 but the N ruling may have had as much immediate impact on those activities especially <unk> as on abortion rights 
 the decision webster vs. reproductive health services illustrates how supreme court rulings often have a <unk> effect spreading into areas of law and policy that were n't part of the actual cases decided and that never were contemplated by the justices 
 in the missouri case <unk> consequences may have <unk> because the high court <unk> the preamble of the state 's N abortion law 
 the preamble says that human life begins at conception and that <unk> children have rights protected by the constitution 
 last year a federal appeals court in st. louis said the preamble was unconstitutional citing an earlier supreme court ruling that states ca n't justify <unk> abortion curbs by changing the definition of when life begins 
 but the supreme court concluded that it was <unk> to rule on the <unk> of the preamble because the definition of human life had n't yet been used to restrict abortion services 
 the high court majority said it was up to the state courts for now to decide whether the definition has any bearing on other state laws 
 already local missouri judges have relied on the restored preamble in two separate cases to throw out criminal trespass charges against anti-abortion demonstrators who blocked access to reproductive health services an abortion clinic in st. louis 
 the protesters said their actions were justified by the desire to save the lives of <unk> children 
 under a N missouri law persons accused of some crimes including <unk> may offer a defense that their actions were justified as an emergency measure to avoid an imminent public or private injury 
 relying on the preamble 's statement that a <unk> is an <unk> child the two st. louis county circuit court judges in august accepted the <unk> that the abortion clinic protesters were trying to save lives 
 in another case a <unk> ann o'brien was convicted of trespass before the supreme court 's webster ruling 
 last week when her appeal was argued before the missouri court of appeals her lawyer also relied on the preamble 
 the effect of the supreme court webster opinion is that it left room for <unk> to grow in the cracks of roe vs. wade and i think this is one of the cracks said mark <unk> a st. louis lawyer who represented ms. o'brien and the other st. louis protesters 
 roe vs. wade was the supreme court 's N decision that recognized a woman 's right to abortion 
 mario <unk> president of kansas city lawyers for life says that if abortion foes succeed in using the preamble to escape prosecution for trespass this will shut down abortion in missouri 
 there 's no risk to the protesters and you ca n't keep an abortion clinic open if there are N people standing outside every day 
 that would be an ironic result of a case in which the supreme court <unk> stopped short of <unk> roe vs. wade 
 in two other cases the possible consequences of the supreme court ruling appear even more <unk> 
 in one the lawyer for a <unk> resident of columbia mo. who was charged with drunk driving argued that his client should be treated as a <unk> adult because his actual age should be calculated from conception not from birth 
 in missouri those caught drinking and driving between the ages of N and N may have their licenses <unk> for one year while those N or older suffer only a 30-day suspension 
 a boone county judge rejected the motion but daniel <unk> a jefferson city lawyer says he has appealed 
 and in a case filed in federal court in august a lawyer is arguing that missouri authorities are <unk> <unk> the <unk> of a pregnant woman who is in jail for theft and <unk> 
 in terms of sheer <unk> the <unk> regime of <unk> barre may rank as no. N in the world 
 the only reason that somalia remains in <unk> is numbers a <unk> <unk> <unk> of N million people spread out over an <unk> nearly the size of texas 
 the barre <unk> simply is limited in the amount of people it can <unk> and kill 
 <unk> small children <unk> elderly people to death <unk> and shooting women and <unk> people alive are just a few of the <unk> activities that the <unk> armed forces have been engaged in over the past two years 
 up to N <unk> have escaped to the relative safety of marxist ethiopia because of the behavior of president barre 's troops 
 in the port of <unk> for example hundreds of men of the rival <unk> <unk> were <unk> up in may N <unk> and then taken out at night in groups of five to N men to be executed without any judicial process <unk> 
 guns were never used each man was <unk> to death with a large <unk> 
 the <unk> details are only now emerging from a <unk> <unk> report based on hundreds of interviews with <unk> selected refugees 
 the study was done by robert <unk> a consultant to the u.s. state department who has years of experience in investigating human-rights abuses on both sides of the <unk> ideological divide 
 what gives these events particular significance however is the fact that they are part of a wider drama affecting the strategic positions of both the u.s. and the soviet union on the horn of africa 
 not since the late 1970s has the horn been so up for <unk> as it has suddenly become in just the past few weeks 
 mr. barre 's rule is crumbling fast 
 <unk> <unk> his armed forces really just an armed gang which control less than half the country 
 inflation is at record levels 
 desperate he has called in the <unk> to help fight the rebels of the <unk> national movement in the north which is only one of several groups picking away at the regime in the capital of <unk> 
 <unk> years old and a <unk> scientific socialist president barre has a power base composed only of his minority <unk> <unk> that according to observers is narrowing 
 the u.s. 's interest in somalia consists of a single runway at the port of <unk> which u.s. military aircraft have the right to use for <unk> of the gulf of <unk> and the indian ocean 
 that strip of concrete is backed up by a few <unk> <unk> <unk> where a handful of american <unk> <unk> by imported food cold soft drinks and back issues of sports illustrated maintain radio contact with the outside world 
 in the past two years the desert behind them has become a land of mass executions and <unk> <unk> where due to mr. barre 's <unk> and <unk> nobody is any longer in control 
 as long as the rival <unk> regime of mengistu <unk> <unk> held a total gridlock over neighboring ethiopia the u.s. was forced to accept that <unk> <unk> runway as a distant no. N to the soviets ' array of <unk> next door 
 but due to dramatic events on the <unk> over the past few days and weeks those soviet bases may soon be as endangered and as <unk> as the american runway 
 on sept. N i wrote on these pages about the killing and <unk> of N <unk> soldiers by <unk> and <unk> guerrillas 
 recently in <unk> province in the center of ethiopia <unk> forces have killed <unk> and captured an additional N government troops 
 think what these numbers mean considering the headline space devoted to hundreds of deaths in lebanon a small country of little strategic importance 
 <unk> <unk> are now N miles north of <unk> <unk> threatening the town of <unk> which would cut off mr. mengistu 's capital from the port of <unk> through which all fuel and other supplies reach <unk> <unk> 
 as a result mr. mengistu has been forced to transfer thousands of troops from <unk> just to hold the town thereby <unk> the loss of even more territory in <unk> only to keep the <unk> at bay 
 mr. mengistu is in an increasingly weak position half his army is tied down defending the northern city of <unk> from the <unk> 
 the weaker he gets the more he turns toward the u.s. for help 
 while the <unk> are communists like the <unk> they are among the most <unk> guerrillas in the world having suffered more than a decade of <unk> <unk> by the <unk> mengistu air force 
 what this all means in <unk> is that soviet dominance in ethiopia is <unk> as fast as president barre 's regime in somalia is 
 the u.s. therefore has a historic opportunity both to strike a blow for human rights in somalia and to undo the <unk> <unk> of the late 1970s on the horn of africa 
 back to somalia 
 the state department to its credit has already begun <unk> itself from mr. barre <unk> by its decision to publish the <unk> report which the press has ignored 
 what 's more the u.s. has suspended $ N million in military aid and $ N million in economic aid 
 but this is not enough 
 because the u.s. is still perceived to be tied to mr. barre when he goes the runway could go too 
 considering how <unk> the security of that runway is anyway the better option both morally and <unk> would be for the bush administration to blast the regime publicly in terms clear enough for all influential <unk> to understand 
 it is a <unk> that mr. barre 's days are numbered 
 the u.s. should take care however that its own position in the country does not go down with him 
 nobody is sure what will come next in somalia or whom the successor might be 
 but as one expert tells me whoever it is will have to work pretty damn hard to be worse than barre 
 while the state department positions itself for the <unk> period in somalia it should continue to back former president carter 's <unk> role as a mediator between mr. mengistu and the <unk> guerrillas in ethiopia while <unk> opening up channels of communications with the <unk> rebels through neighboring <unk> 
 <unk> politics are the most sophisticated <unk> and <unk> in all of black africa 
 remember that it took mr. mengistu many months in what became known as the creeping coup to topple <unk> <unk> <unk> in N and N 
 there is simply no way to engineer a succession <unk> as is sometimes possible elsewhere on the continent 
 but the u.s. has one great advantage the soviets are <unk> <unk> throughout ethiopia for what they did to the country this past decade <unk> and all 
 it 's not just in eastern europe where the march of events is finally on the u.s. side but on the horn of africa as well 
 the only u.s. liability in the region is what remains of the link to mr. barre and that should be cut fast 
 mr. <unk> author of surrender or <unk> the wars behind the <unk> <unk> press N lives in <unk> 
 <unk> inc. <unk> <unk> calif. got an $ N million navy contract for <unk> systems 
 general electric co. received a $ N million air force contract for <unk> nose <unk> 
 goodyear tire & rubber co. was awarded a $ N million army contract for <unk> parts 
 <unk> sciences corp. was awarded a $ N million air force contract for technical support 
 mccormick capital inc. said the final <unk> factor was N on its oversubscribed $ <unk> tender offer to buy back as many as N million of its common shares 
 payment will begin as soon as oct. N the company said 
 mccormick is a developer and manager of <unk> limited partnerships 
 through a separate agreement between peter <unk> president and a group of selling shareholders the company said mr. <unk> will on oct. N buy N shares from the group boosting his stake to about N shares or N N of the total after the buy-back

 opec 's ability to produce more petroleum than it can sell is beginning to cast a shadow over world oil markets 
 output from the organization of petroleum exporting countries is already at a high for the year and most member nations are running flat out 
 but industry and opec officials agree that a handful of members still have enough unused capacity to <unk> the market and cause an <unk> collapse a few months from now if opec does n't soon adopt a new quota system to <unk> its <unk> <unk> 
 as a result the effort by some oil ministers to get opec to approve a new permanent <unk> agreement next month is taking on increasing urgency 
 the organization is scheduled to meet in vienna beginning nov. N 
 so far this year rising demand for opec oil and production restraint by some members have kept prices firm despite rampant cheating by others 
 but that could change if demand for opec 's oil <unk> seasonally early next year as some think may happen 
 opec is currently producing more than N million barrels a day sharply above its nominal <unk> fourth-quarter ceiling of N million according to opec and industry officials at an oil conference here sponsored by the oil daily and the international herald tribune 
 at that rate a majority of opec 's N members have reached their output limits they said 
 but it is estimated that at least three million barrels a day and possibly as much as seven million barrels a day of spare capacity still exists within opec 
 most is concentrated in five persian gulf countries including his own <unk> <unk> <unk> 's oil minister told the conference friday 
 he puts opec 's current capacity at N million to N million barrels a day 
 that 's higher than some other estimates 
 <unk> <unk> <unk> kuwait 's oil minister recently estimated opec capacity at N million barrels a day 
 either way the <unk> is big enough to keep <unk> balanced oil markets on edge 
 even modest amounts of additional output by those with the huge extra capacity and reserves such as saudi arabia and <unk> could upset the market 
 the <unk> oil minister and saudi oil minister <unk> <unk> insisted in their comments to the conference that their countries would act <unk> to maintain a stable market 
 however in interviews later both ministers stressed that they expect future opec quotas to be based mainly on the production capacity and reserves of each member 
 under that approach countries with the most unused oil capacity would get bigger shares of any future increases in opec 's production ceiling than they would under the current system 
 if you are already producing at N N or N N of your capacity what 's the good to be told you can produce at N N of capacity asked mr. <unk> 
 at an <unk> geneva meeting late last month opec 's oil ministers <unk> approved another increase of one million barrels a day in their production ceiling 
 they <unk> it out using the existing formula however which meant that even those countries that could n't produce more received higher official <unk> 
 the main effect of the ceiling boost was to <unk> some of the <unk> already coming from the quota <unk> 
 still there was a <unk> at geneva 
 previously no opec member had been willing to accept a reduction in its percentage share of the group 's total output target or ceiling 
 but the concept of disproportionate quotas for those with unused capacity advanced there in an iranian proposal was generally endorsed by the ministers 
 in the end politics got in the way 
 libya accepted iran 's proposal only so long as it was promised production parity with kuwait 
 and the united arab <unk> a <unk> quota <unk> refused to give any guarantee it would change its ways 
 but the oil ministers continue to study the plan and it will probably be the basis for discussion at next month 's meeting 
 it 's understood several <unk> already have been worked into the plan 
 the ceiling would be lifted to N million barrels to provide kuwait and the united arab <unk> much higher official quotas while reducing percentage shares of some others 
 libya 's previous conditions are no longer considered a problem although the united arab <unk> is still an issue 
 saudi arabia opec 's <unk> also has surfaced as a possible obstacle some opec sources said 
 insisting on a N N share of any ceiling saudi officials have long pressed for the pro <unk> distribution of increases to all members 
 in geneva however they supported iran 's proposal because it would have left the saudi percentage of the opec total intact and increased actual saudi volume to nearly N million barrels daily from five million 
 some of the proposed modifications since however call on saudi arabia to give back to the <unk> pool a <unk> N barrels 
 though tiny that 's a reduction in its share 
 mr. <unk> the saudi oil minister reiterated here that the kingdom would insist on maintaining its percentage share of opec production under any quota revisions 
 under any circumstances saudi arabia should get more rather than less mr. <unk> said 
 in a blow to france 's rafale jet fighter the french navy for the first time publicly stated its desire to buy N mcdonnell douglas corp. <unk> <unk> to defend its aircraft carriers 
 the statement is likely to <unk> the debate within france 's military establishment over the rafale which is made by <unk> <unk> <unk> aviation <unk> 
 in an interview in the navy 's official weekly magazine <unk> <unk> the navy 's <unk> adm. <unk> goupil said the navy still intends to buy N <unk> as scheduled in the late 1990s and early <unk> century 
 the air force is to take at least N more 
 adm. goupil said the navy ca n't wait until N when the naval rafale becomes available to replace its <unk> fleet of <unk> crusaders used since the 1950s to protect carriers from attack 
 rather than <unk> the crusaders which dassault is proposing to do for around N billion french francs $ N million adm. goupil said the navy wants to buy used <unk> from the u.s. navy 
 officially the statement is n't an attack on the rafale 
 adm. goupil said that when the <unk> wear out the navy is prepared to take <unk> to replace them 
 but <unk> senior navy officials sharply <unk> the rafale as an air force plane <unk> to carrier use 
 although they never said so publicly they have made no secret of their preference for the <unk> on operational grounds 
 adm. goupil 's comments are likely to <unk> the broader dispute within the military establishment here over the role of dassault 
 although <unk> dassault still is run by the founder 's son chairman <unk> dassault who has fiercely protected his company 's independence 
 the rafale project is the result of france 's inability jointly to develop a plane with other countries and french officials question whether the state can continue paying for expensive independent programs 
 so far mr. dassault has resisted pressure to change 
 what brought the naval issue to a head is that the crusaders are literally falling apart without any immediate plan to replace them 
 adm. goupil a former <unk> <unk> leader said that the last other country to use crusaders the philippines retired its last ones two years ago 
 a french <unk> crash a few months ago heightened pressure for new planes here 
 adm. goupil rejected dassault 's proposal to <unk> the crusaders saying the cost was impossible to estimate 
 even <unk> he said the crusaders represent an <unk> and dangerous protection for the aircraft carriers france has sent to meet such crises as the wars in lebanon and the persian gulf 
 defense minister <unk> <unk> told a meeting of the <unk> press association that the question of <unk> the crusaders or buying used <unk> is a political decision that he will make in due time

 for cathay pacific airways the smooth ride may be ending 
 the first signs of trouble came last month when the hong kong carrier a subsidiary of <unk> pacific ltd. posted a N N drop in operating profit for the first six months and warned that margins will remain under pressure for the rest of the year 
 securities analysts many of whom scrapped their buy recommendations after seeing cathay 's interim figures believe more <unk> lie ahead 
 fuel and personnel costs are rising and tourism in and through hong kong remains <unk> by china 's turmoil since the june N killings in beijing 
 in addition delivery delays for the first two of as many as N boeing <unk> that the carrier has ordered have raised costs because personnel had been hired to man the planes 
 and tough competition in the air-freight market is cutting into an important sideline 
 there also is concern that once hong kong <unk> to china 's sovereignty in N cathay will be forced to play second <unk> to china 's <unk> flag carrier civil aviation administration of china or <unk> 
 the sense is we would never be in a position again where everything works for us the way it did before says rod eddington cathay 's commercial director 
 <unk> hall an analyst at james capel far east ltd. says there is n't much cathay can do about rising costs for jet fuel hong kong 's tight labor market or the strengthening of the local currency which is pegged to the u.s. dollar 
 these factors are further complicated by the airline 's push to transform itself from a regional carrier to an international one ms. hall says 
 ms. hall expects cathay 's profit to grow around N N annually this year and next 
 in N it earned $ N billion hong kong us$ N million on revenue of hk$ N billion 
 cathay is taking several steps to bolster business 
 one step is to beef up its fleet 
 in addition to aircraft from boeing co. cathay announced earlier this year an order for as many as N airbus <unk> 
 the expansion which could cost as much as us$ N billion over the next eight years will expand the fleet to about N planes by N up from N at the end of last year according to sun hung <unk> securities ltd 
 the <unk> airbus planes will be used largely to replace cathay 's aging fleet of lockheed <unk> for regional flights while the boeing aircraft will be used on <unk> routes to europe and north america 
 cathay also is moving some of its <unk> <unk> operations outside hong kong 
 fierce bidding for young employees in hong kong is pushing up cathay 's labor costs by N N a year for <unk> staff while experienced skilled employees are leaving the colony as part of the brain drain 
 some jobs already have been moved to australia and there are plans to place others in canada 
 david bell a spokesman for the airline says the move is partly aimed at retaining existing staff who are leaving to secure foreign <unk> ahead of N 
 cathay is working to promote hong kong as a <unk> worth visiting on its own merits rather than just a <unk> 
 although the june N killings in beijing have hurt its china flights cathay 's other routes have retained high load factors 
 mr. eddington <unk> promoting hong kong as an important part of attracting visitors from japan south korea and taiwan where the number of people looking to travel abroad has surged 
 there also has been speculation that cathay will be among the major private-sector participants in the hong kong government 's plans to build a new airport with the carrier possibly investing in its own terminal 
 cathay officials decline to comment on the speculation 
 mr. eddington sees alliances with other carriers particularly cathay 's recent link with amr corp. 's american airlines as an important part of cathay 's strategy 
 but he <unk> that cathay has n't any interest in <unk> equity stakes with the u.s. carrier or with lufthansa the west german airline with which it has <unk> for about a decade 
 analysts believe cathay is approached for such swaps by other carriers on a regular basis particularly as the popularity of share exchanges has grown among european carriers 
 we think alliances are very important mr. eddington says 
 but we 'd rather put funds into our own business rather than someone else 's 
 i 'm not sure <unk> would necessarily make things <unk> 
 in a pattern it aims to copy in several key u.s. <unk> cathay recently announced plans to serve san francisco by flying into american airlines ' los angeles hub and <unk> continuing passengers onto a flight on the u.s. carrier 
 we 'll never have a big operation in the u.s. and they 'll never have one as big as us in the pacific mr. eddington says 
 but this way american will coordinate good <unk> to boston new york chicago and dallas 
 we 'll coordinate on this end to places like <unk> singapore and manila 
 asian traffic which currently accounts for N N of cathay 's business is expected to continue as the carrier 's mainstay 
 cathay has long stated its desire to double its weekly flights into china to N and it is applying to <unk> <unk> flights into vietnam 
 further expansion into southern europe is also possible says mr. bell the spokesman 
 while a large number of hong kong companies have <unk> offshore ahead of N such a move is n't an option for cathay because it would jeopardize its landing rights in hong kong 
 and mr. eddington <unk> rules out a move to london our <unk> is hong kong traffic rights 
 he says the airline is putting its faith in the <unk> agreement on hong kong 's return to china 
 a special section dealing with aviation rights states that landing rights for hong kong 's airlines which include the smaller hong kong <unk> airlines will continue to be negotiated by hong kong 's government 
 but critics <unk> that <unk> officials ultimately will be responsible to beijing 
 my feeling is cathay does n't have a hope in the long run says an analyst who declines to be identified 
 cathay would love to keep going but the general sense is they 're going to have to do something 
 mr. eddington acknowledges that the carrier will have to <unk> and <unk> to local changes but he feels that the <unk> agreement is firm ground to build on for the foreseeable future 
 we 're confident that it protects our route structure he says and our ability to grow and <unk>

 a young woman who has been out of town shows up at the marina middle school to learn that her apartment is on the <unk> list 
 she is told she ca n't enter unless she is accompanied by an inspector 
 she bursts into <unk> and walks away 
 nearby five temporary residents of the school shelter sit on <unk> having their <unk> and backs <unk> by volunteer <unk> 
 the marina rescue center offered a very san <unk> response to the disaster 
 in addition to free massages there was free counseling phone calls and a free shuttle bus to a health club which offered up its <unk> <unk> and hot <unk> 
 the cafeteria offered donated <unk> and <unk> for breakfast and for dinner pasta <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> along with the <unk> 
 this has been a <unk> earthquake for me said resident joan <unk> who works in an <unk> 's office 
 she and some friends are considering offering earthquake victims free <unk> classes and <unk> therapy massages with <unk> oils 
 she finds the response of marina residents primarily <unk> and elderly people to the devastation of their homes incredible 
 people have been very <unk> of each other 
 i do n't know if this would have happened somewhere else 
 out on the streets some residents of badly damaged buildings were allowed a <unk> <unk> hunt through their <unk> 
 it 's so weird to have to decide what 's really important to you said barbara may

 some residents <unk> orders and returned to red buildings to retrieve goods 
 one building was upgraded to red status while people were taking things out and a resident who was n't allowed to go back inside called up the <unk> to his girlfriend telling her to keep sending things down to the lobby 
 a <unk> had to be called in to make her leave the <unk> helped carry out one last load 
 enforcement of <unk> rules was sporadic residents said 
 one man trying to remove his car was told by officials to get out of his garage 
 when he <unk> back later to try again a different <unk> offered to help him get the car out 
 the marina also has become the <unk> point of city efforts to <unk> residents with any <unk> that may have fled or become lost during the earthquake 
 on <unk> along <unk> street a major marina artery <unk> were offering a $ N reward for a cat lost during the quake 
 the san francisco society for the prevention of <unk> to animals also has been providing medical care food water and foster homes for <unk> animals 
 the <unk> says it has received more than N requests for foster homes on behalf of dogs and <unk> though some people have sought temporary homes for birds and fish 
 for example one <unk> owner returning home found that her apartment like many others in the marina did n't have heat 
 she can stay there with no heat but for a <unk> that can be deadly says <unk> <unk> <unk> services manager for the <unk> 
 a warm foster home has been found 
 the neighborhood around alexander <unk> co. 's vermont-slauson shopping center in the watts section of los angeles resembles the <unk> deteriorating sections of many inner cities and certainly is n't the sort of area one would choose to visit 
 but turn into the shopping center 's parking lot and one could be in the safe busy mall of a <unk> suburb 
 only it is safer and <unk> 
 over the past year there have been only one <unk> three <unk> of or from autos no <unk> and one attempted <unk> in the mall which opened in late N 
 a shopping center of similar size in an affluent los angeles suburb would per year be expected to have eight <unk> N <unk> of or from autos and four <unk> 
 the watts mall has annual sales of more than $ N per <unk> square foot the figure for a comparable suburban shopping center would be $ N 
 three other <unk> shopping centers in the watts area are doing almost as well 
 a successful <unk> mall in a <unk> area violates the more typical inner-city pattern in which commercial areas are taken over by <unk> youth gangs and the criminal element with an erosion of the customer base development capital and <unk> 
 major regional and national chain stores are replaced by <unk> operations offering <unk> merchandise at higher prices 
 along with the exodus of shopping opportunities is an exodus of the jobs that the major chains used to provide to community residents 
 thus there is even more to the vermont-slauson center than a good place to shop 
 this <unk> commercial zone becomes for the residents a secure <unk> in a <unk> urban landscape evidence that community <unk> is not inevitable and that the gangs are not <unk> 
 the center improves the community image to outsiders as well and may help to arrest or even reverse the exodus of capital and investment 
 an additional benefit is the creation of jobs 
 this starts in the construction phase through the use of minority contractors and local workers 
 it continues through the life of the center the vermont-slauson center has created N permanent private-sector jobs at a one-time cost in public funds of only $ N per job 
 as many of these jobs are filled by local residents who move from the welfare rolls to the tax rolls the $ <unk> public investment should repay itself in a few years 
 and that is before consideration of increased state and local revenues from taxes and fees on sales real estate licenses and the like 
 profits are also <unk> back into the community the <unk> vermont-slauson economic development corp. receives N N of the profits from the vermont-slauson center and uses the money to provide moderate and low-cost housing in the community now running into the hundreds of units as well as commercial and industrial development projects 
 bradford <unk> director of the mayor 's city economic development office says there is no question that vermont-slauson had a <unk> effect on the surrounding neighborhood 
 what had been a deteriorated area with nothing but <unk> shops and <unk> shops is now experiencing a major upgrading in the housing and commercial stock thanks to a <unk> <unk> source of <unk> capital that vermont-slauson yields 
 another benefit is that substantial <unk> of the <unk> in these centers are minority businessmen and women 
 in the grand <unk> plaza developed by <unk> realty group in chicago 's third ward opposite the robert taylor homes N N of the stores to date have been leased to blacks and N N to members of other minority groups 
 children from the community will have <unk> role models than the drug <unk> 
 so what 's the catch 
 primarily that putting one of these inner-city deals together takes time patience <unk> of vision and negotiating skills that not all developers <unk> 
 security costs are also quite high 
 one of these centers can involve years of negotiating with numerous public agencies local political leaders and citizen groups and with prospective tenants and sources of financing 
 suburban deals are not without their delays and <unk> inner-city deals just have more of them 
 security at a typical <unk> inner-city center is impressive but <unk> 
 the entire site is <unk> by a <unk> <unk> iron <unk> with a small number of <unk> gates 
 <unk> and flowers give it a <unk> and <unk> appearance 
 <unk> motion detectors and <unk> tv cameras monitor the entire center lighting levels are three to five times the industry standard 
 the security command post <unk> as <unk> retail space has its own <unk> 's <unk> above the <unk> of the other buildings with a <unk> view of the entire center 
 local law enforcement is present in a <unk> <unk> space donated by the center 
 these features are also used in <unk> realty group 's grand <unk> plaza 
 <unk> has its own large security force of <unk> and <unk> personnel on <unk> duty at each center 
 security is N N to N N of the common area charges of these centers vs. an industry average of about N N 
 these security costs are kept <unk> because the centers ' site acquisition construction and financing costs were reduced by such programs as urban development action grants economic development administration grants community development block grants tax-free industrial development bonds enterprise zone tax write-offs city infrastructure grants and tax <unk> financing 
 many of these programs no longer exist or have been severely cut back 
 however since these centers appear to pay for themselves there is nothing to prevent state and local governments from <unk> legislation with similar provisions 
 many states already have enterprise zones and legislation that combines tax incentives loans and grants to encourage investment in depressed areas with requirements for the hiring of the <unk> and minorities 
 these programs could be expanded to focus on funds for project planning identifying sources of funds and for acquiring a site and preparing it 
 <unk> crime and the fear of it in inner-city commercial areas should give enterprise zones more success than most have enjoyed to date 
 with many suburban areas basically overbuilt with shopping centers inner-city areas may represent a major new <unk> market for investment 
 new approaches to mall design and operation make it possible to tap these markets 
 if the risks and rewards are reasonable developers will respond 
 government officials who wonder how important it is for them to encourage development in high-risk areas should visit vermont-slauson and grand <unk> plaza and decide for themselves 
 the answer will be obvious

 if growth <unk> its <unk> among investors a sluggish segment of the nasdaq over-the-counter market could show some <unk> 
 some stock pickers already are targeting the otc market where they say await plenty of small and medium-sized growth stocks 
 best of all they add these growth issues unlike their big blue-chip <unk> on the new york stock exchange are <unk> at depressed prices 
 growth stocks will return to favor some analysts and money managers think because of the jitters caused by the market 's steep slide on oct. N and because of the current swell of disappointing earnings announcements 
 against such a backdrop companies with proven track records of earnings gains of N N or so annually have extra appeal 
 the market will have to look for a new theme now and that theme will be a return to growth declares mary farrell a painewebber analyst 
 among her otc picks are <unk> <unk> and <unk> brands 
 like many otc growth issues they have market values as measured by stock price times shares outstanding of roughly $ N million to $ N million 
 some like to specialize in growth companies whose shares have n't traded publicly very long 
 these are sometimes dubbed emerging growth companies though they also have <unk> track records 
 while many growth stocks are small not all small stocks have <unk> momentum 
 that 's an important <unk> because some analysts and brokers who <unk> predict that small stocks are about to outperform bigger issues may use any <unk> in growth issues to help them sell all small stocks

 <unk> smaller growth stocks have n't been in favor recently 
 the average issue on standard & poor 's 500-stock index gained N N last year ms. farrell of painewebber says 
 <unk> earnings by comparison rose between N N and N N 
 in addition earnings growth took a back seat to cash flow restructuring and takeover potential and breakup value as the preferred <unk> standards for much of the year 
 also the smaller growth stocks are n't widely traded and so are harder to buy and sell quickly than blue chips 
 as a result morgan stanley 's index of N emerging growth stocks most of which are in the otc market is up only N N for the year while the dow jones industrial average has leaped N N and the s&p N has grown N N 
 the nasdaq composite has gained N N this year but that 's largely due to the N largest <unk> stocks which have soared N N

 for bankers and regulators arizona is looking more like texas every day 
 on friday los angeles-based first interstate bancorp said it expects a net loss of $ N million for the third quarter of N because of hemorrhaging at its first interstate bank of arizona unit 
 first interstate said the unit <unk> by arizona 's worsening real-estate woes will have a $ N million loss for the quarter 
 first interstate took a huge $ N million provision for loan losses at the arizona bank 
 it charged off an estimated $ N million of arizona loans leaving the unit with a reserve for future losses of $ N million about N N of its $ N million of troubled loans and <unk> real estate 
 first interstate made the move under pressure from regulators 
 the action capped a <unk> of grim arizona banking news for the third quarter and <unk> signaled that arizona is challenging texas 's long <unk> as banking 's busiest <unk> 
 earlier last week valley national corp. the state 's largest locally owned banking company reported a $ N million loss and suspended its dividend 
 pinnacle west capital corp. which has been <unk> with regulators for months over what to do about pinnacle 's <unk> merabank thrift unit suspended its dividend and reported a N N plunge in third-quarter net income 
 security pacific corp. said third-quarter credit losses surged a third to $ N million mainly because of sour arizona real-estate loans 
 new york-based chase manhattan corp. took an $ N million <unk> charge 
 furthermore the regulatory <unk> behind first interstate 's loss suggests regulators have concluded that lenders ' reserves are far too low to absorb their future arizona losses and are forcing bankers to do something about it 
 <unk> from the office of the comptroller of the currency had been <unk> through first interstate 's real-estate portfolio since last month they first recommended that first interstate take a provision that was less than the eventual $ N million third-quarter hit 
 when first interstate balked arguing that the figure was too high regulators responded by raising their recommendation to $ N million 
 at that point first interstate decided it was the better part of <unk> not to negotiate further said one industry official close to the talks 
 thomas p. <unk> chief financial officer would n't comment about the details of the negotiations 
 he said the provision was n't forced upon us but the regulators made it very clear what they thought was an appropriate number 
 the tough regulatory stance <unk> large future losses especially at the state 's thrifts 
 at least six of arizona 's N savings and loan institutions have either been taken over by the government 's conservatorship program or are essentially insolvent they are sitting on enormous <unk> losses 
 for example western savings & loan association which is now in conservatorship had tangible <unk> minus liabilities of a negative $ N million at june N 
 it had a $ N million loss in the second quarter 
 yet it still held $ N million of <unk> real estate for which it maintains no reserves <unk> 
 it also had $ N million of <unk> loans its level of reserves against those was n't immediately available though it is believed to be small 
 the rapid deterioration of the arizona thrifts only adds to the <unk> cost of the government 's massive thrift bailout officially estimated at about $ N billion 
 together the six <unk> or essentially insolvent arizona thrifts have tangible capital of a negative $ N billion foreclosed property of $ N billion and <unk> loans of $ N billion 
 they have no reserves against the real estate and their reserves against the loans are <unk> compared with the levels of reserves banks are moving to set up 
 the thrifts had a combined loss of $ N million in the second quarter 
 other lenders have been recovering only N cents to N cents on the dollar on foreclosed arizona property if they can sell it at all 
 all this havoc is the result of one of the worst <unk> in arizona 's <unk> history compounded by some of the usual suspects in 1980s banking <unk> greed fraud and plain bad banking 
 in the late 1970s and early 1980s lenders and developers poured money into office buildings <unk> and massive <unk> of raw desert land confident that arizona 's population would grow at annual rates of N N to N N for years to come 
 now annual population growth is running at about N N a year some desert <unk> bought three years ago for $ N an <unk> are being sold at $ N an <unk> and phoenix has a seven-year supply of <unk> office space 
 it 's horrible to say but it 's unfortunate that earthquake was n't in phoenix it might have knocked out some of our empty buildings said <unk> jackson a prominent arizona businessman with interests in real estate banking and many other businesses 
 many arizona real-estate experts think the worst may be yet to come 
 ralph <unk> publisher of <unk> update newsletter said <unk> have climbed to about N a month just in <unk> county where phoenix is located 
 that 's up from about N a month in N and it 's accelerating so far this month <unk> are averaging about N a day 
 it 's <unk> mr. <unk> said 
 moreover mr. <unk> and others said residential real estate which had remained fairly strong through most of the downturn is beginning to <unk> more and more of the <unk> 
 and the generally <unk> condition of arizona 's lenders means there is little capital available in the state to shore up the economy and slow down the slide 
 it 's reasonable to say there is not a <unk> s&l in the state and the amount of viable bank capital is very low said mr. jackson 
 we 're going to see another big wave of failures and defaults between now and year-end 
 the only thing a lot of these lenders can get out of their mouth now is pay me in N days 
 first interstate had a $ N million loss in N 's third quarter mainly from <unk> and reserves connected with its texas operations 
 for the six months ended june N it reported net income of $ N million or $ N a share including $ N million from tax credits and accounting changes 
 the bank 's arizona unit holds about $ N billion of first interstate 's $ N billion of assets 
 mr. <unk> said the bank expects arizona real-estate prices which plummeted N N over the last year to fall another N N before stabilizing 
 some in arizona think that may be optimistic 
 first interstate said its operations outside of arizona achieved results as expected for the quarter but did n't specify the results 
 first interstate stock closed at $ N down N cents in composite trading friday on the new york stock exchange 
 since its unsuccessful bid for bankamerica corp. in N the bank has undertaken a major restructuring in an effort to cut costs and boost performance but many industry officials believe it may be <unk> for a takeover bid especially with interstate banking set to begin in california in N 
 mr. <unk> said the problems in arizona have only increased our resolve to continue to make our restructuring even more effective 
 separately standard & poor 's corp. lowered its ratings on valley national corp. 's senior debt to <unk> from <unk> affecting about $ N million of long-term debt 
 s&p also lowered ratings on unsecured deposits and issues backed by a letter of credit from the bank holding company 's principal unit valley national bank of arizona 
 the ratings service said the <unk> reflect the continued slide in the company 's financial condition 
 a spokesman for phoenix <unk> valley national said the concern will be able to withstand the current downturn in arizona real estate 
 commercial paper holders have reinvested their funds he said and consumer deposits have been up in the last few days 
 <unk> corp. said its scientists isolated a <unk> which may hold potential as a treatment for disruptions of the <unk> ranging from <unk> rejection to <unk> and <unk> 
 the <unk> is the mouse version of a protein called the <unk> <unk> 
 <unk> is a <unk> which directs the growth and function of white blood cells involved in the body 's immune response 
 the <unk> <unk> on the surface of such cells receives the <unk> 's message to rally the body 's defense 
 but in certain conditions such as <unk> diseases and <unk> and transplant rejection doctors would like to damp the immune response so such cells do n't touch off harmful <unk> reactions or cell destruction 
 a <unk> form of the <unk> might turn off a specific part of the immune response without general immune <unk> the company said 
 the <unk> <unk> is one of five such <unk> to be developed and tested by <unk> corp. a spinoff of <unk> through a proposed $ N million initial public offering 
 <unk> will contract with the spinoff to provide the research development and initial testing of the new agents

 conner peripherals inc. which has a <unk> on a key part used in many portable computers is on target to <unk> compaq computer corp. as the fastest-growing start-up manufacturing firm in u.s. business history 
 conner dominates the market for hard-disk drives used to store data in laptop computers 
 it said yesterday that net income for its third quarter soared N N to $ N million or N cents a share from $ N million or N cents a share in the year-ago period 
 its revenue totaled $ N million an increase of N N from $ N million a year ago 
 for the nine months the san jose calif.-based company said net income jumped N N to $ N million or N cents a share from $ N million or N cents a share 
 revenue nearly tripled to $ N million from $ N million 
 analysts expect conner 's earnings to reach roughly $ N million or $ N to $ N a share on sales of $ N million for N the company 's third full year in business 
 that 's a faster growth rate than reported by compaq which did n't post similar results until its fourth year in N 
 but compaq had achieved that level of sales faster than any previous manufacturing start-up 
 conner 's performance is closely tied to the <unk> demand for <unk> computers the computer industry 's fastest-growing segment 
 since its inception conner has both benefited from and helped make possible the rapid spread of portable computers by selling storage devices that consume five to N times less electricity than drives used in desktop machines 
 today conner controls an estimated N N of the hard-disk drive market for laptop computers 
 the company supplies drives to compaq and zenith data systems the top two u.s. manufacturers of <unk> and to toshiba corp. nec corp. and sharp corp. the leading japanese laptop makers 
 they 've had this field to themselves for over a year now and they 've been greatly <unk> said bob <unk> an analyst at <unk> inc. a market researcher in los <unk> calif 
 in the coming months however this is likely to change 
 next month seagate technology which is the dominant supplier of hard-disk drives for personal computers plans to introduce its first family of <unk> drives for <unk> computers 
 and the japanese are likely to keep close on conner 's heels 
 they are going to catch up said david <unk> an analyst with hambrecht & quist 
 both toshiba and nec already produce hard-disk drives and sony also is studying the field mr. <unk> said 
 but conner is n't standing still 
 yesterday the company introduced four products three of which are aimed at a hot new class of computers called <unk> 
 each of the three drives uses a mere N watts of power and one <unk> just N ounces 
 most of our competitors are announcing products based on our older products said <unk> conner chief executive officer and founder of the firm that bears his name 
 we continue to develop products faster than anyone else can 
 these new products could account for as much as N N of the company 's business in N mr. conner estimated 
 we 're not afraid of <unk> some of our old stuff to stay ahead of the competition he said 
 conner already is shipping its new drives 
 last week for instance compaq introduced its first notebook computer to <unk> reviews 
 conner is supplying hard-disk drives for the machine which <unk> only six pounds and fits in a <unk> 
 from its inception conner has targeted the market for <unk> machines building hard-disk drives that are smaller and use far less power than those offered by competitors such as seagate 
 the availability of these drives in turn boosted demand for laptop computers whose <unk> had been limited because of lack of storage 
 conner also makes hard-disk drives for desktop computers and is a major supplier to compaq which as of july owned N N of conner 's stock 
 sales to compaq represented N N of conner 's business in its third quarter compared with N N in the year-ago period

 in an effort to determine whether a caller has reason to sue cane lawyers review documents and perform research if necessary with the help of three law <unk> and several support staffers 
 there is no charge for research only for time on the phone 
 if the matter requires further legal work or litigation mr. cane says his lawyers may refer the client to a law firm 
 but he says cane & associates does n't receive <unk> fees

 illinois joins N other states that allow public participation in <unk> proceedings and N states that open disciplinary hearings to the public according to the american bar association

 in addition he says publishing the names of lawyers who are facing charges <unk> subjects them to public <unk>

 the loss of the cigarette account would be a severe blow to wells rich 
 benson & hedges has been one of its most <unk> campaigns as well as one of its largest clients 
 the account billed almost $ N million last year according to leading national advertisers

 bond corp holdings ltd. posted a loss for fiscal N of N million australian dollars us$ N million the largest in australian corporate history 
 that loss compared with a year-earlier profit of a$ N million 
 in preliminary <unk> results reported friday bond corp. also posted an operating loss of a$ N million for the year ended june N compared with operating profit of a$ N million a year earlier 
 operating revenue rose N N to a$ N billion from a$ N billion 
 but the net interest bill jumped N N to a$ N million from a$ N million 
 bond corp. has interests in brewing media and communications natural resources and property 
 much of bond corp. 's losses stemmed from one-time write-downs of the value of some of bond corp. 's assets and those of its units 
 the results included a a$ N million write-off of future income-tax benefits and a provision for a loss of a$ N million on the sale of a stake of about N N in <unk> plc 
 however bond corp. said the tax benefits remain available and might be used later 
 earnings before interest and tax from brewing <unk> N N to a$ N million from a$ N million 
 the company said the general financial performance of its u.s. brewing operations g. <unk> brewing co. was disappointing and this has been reflected in the results 
 bond corp. 's shares closed friday before news of the results at N australian cents a share up one australian cent 
 the staggering losses cap a tumultuous year for alan bond and his flagship bond corp 
 only a year ago the chairman of bond corp. who controls about N N of the company appeared to be building a war <unk> to attack some big companies 
 now bond corp. has agreed to sell at least half its australian brewing assets 
 it has sold billions of dollars of other assets and has more on the block 
 but in a tv interview sunday mr. bond said we 've taken a big loss 
 we 've taken it on the <unk> 
 but we 're out there and we 're going to stay in business 
 bond corp. signaled it will focus on building its domestic and international media and communications businesses 
 it said it will look at opportunities in brewing property and energy resources to the extent consistent with the dominant objective of <unk> <unk> ratios 
 the result will ultimately be a very different group in size and structure bond corp. directors said in a statement 
 some analysts contend the total <unk> should have been much greater and bond corp. 's auditors cited a list of several assets and deals about which there is uncertainty regarding the current value and potential impact on the firm 
 bond corp. said the acknowledged losses mean net asset backing is in the red to the tune of N australian cents a share vs. positive asset backing of a$ N a share a year ago 
 still the directors said having fully considered all aspects of the company 's state of affairs and future cash flows the directors confirm absolutely that the company is <unk> 
 indeed in a note to the results directors said if the true worth of some of the group 's assets were taken into account instead of using book values the negative net asset backing a share would turn into a substantial positive one 
 the <unk> supermarket went out of business last may 
 the reason was not high interest rates or labor costs 
 nor was there a shortage of customers in the area the residential <unk> section of northern manhattan 
 the business closed when the owner was murdered by <unk> 
 the owner was israel ortiz a <unk> entrepreneur and father of two 
 in his first year of operating the store he bought for $ N mr. ortiz was robbed at least twice at <unk> 
 the first time he was shot in the hand as he <unk> the <unk> outside 
 the second time he identified two <unk> who were arrested and charged 
 two weeks later perhaps in <unk> mr. ortiz was shot three times in the back during what police classified as a third <unk> attempt 
 that was his reward for working until N p.m. seven days a week to cover his $ N a month rent 
 for providing what his customers described as very personal and helpful service 
 for creating a focus for neighborhood life 
 israel ortiz is only one of the thousands of entrepreneurs and their employees who will be injured or killed by crime this year 
 the u.s. bureau of justice statistics reports that almost N N of all <unk> workers suffer injuries from crime each year almost twice the national average and about four times the rate for teachers truck drivers medical workers and <unk> salespeople 
 only a few other <unk> have higher reported rates of criminal injury such as police <unk> and taxi drivers 
 yet these figures show only the most visible part of the problem 
 recent data from new york city provide more of the picture 
 while by no means the highest crime community in the country new york is a prime example of a city where crime <unk> small-business development 
 a survey of small businesses there was conducted this spring by <unk> a policy research organization 
 it gave N businesses a <unk> and <unk> N responses 
 the survey found that over a three-year period N N of the firms said employees or owners had been robbed on their way to or from work or while on the job 
 <unk> percent reported their customers being robbed 
 crime was the reason that N N reported difficulty recruiting personnel and that N N said they were considering moving 
 more than one-third of the responding businesses said they suffer from drug dealing and <unk> near their premises 
 in brooklyn and the bronx one out of four commercial firms is <unk> each year 
 industrial neighborhoods fare even worse with <unk> rates twice the <unk> average 
 crime is clearly more deadly to <unk> <unk> than to big businesses 
 two decades ago the small business administration reported yale prof. albert <unk> 's landmark study of crime against N small businesses drawn from national irs records 
 he found that monetary crime losses as a proportion of gross receipts were N times higher for small businesses than for large ones 
 the new york study 's companies averaged N employees their annual crime losses averaged about $ N with an additional $ N annual cost in security enough money to hire at least one more worker 
 the costs of crime may also be enough to destroy a struggling business 
 whatever the monetary crime losses they may not be nearly as important to entrepreneurs as the risk of personal injury 
 after repeated gun <unk> some entrepreneurs may give up a business out of fear for their lives 
 one washington couple recently sold their liquor store after N years in business that included four <unk> deaths and N <unk> or <unk> on the premises 
 these findings illustrate the vicious cycle that national institute of justice director james k. stewart calls crime causing poverty 
 <unk> neighborhoods offer relatively few employment opportunities contributing to the poverty of local residents 
 small neighborhood businesses could provide more jobs if crime were not so harmful to creating and maintaining those businesses 
 this may help explain why small businesses create N N of all jobs nationally but only N N of jobs in a <unk> city like new york 
 bigger business can often better afford to minimize the cost of crime 
 the new york study found that the cost of security measures in firms with fewer than five employees was almost $ N per worker compared with one-third that amount for firms with more than N employees 
 the shift of retailing to large shopping centers has created even greater economies of scale for providing <unk> business environments 
 private security guards and <unk> police can <unk> the law of trespass to regulate access to these <unk> places 
 since N in fact revenues of the N largest guard companies primarily serving such big businesses have increased by almost N N 
 few small neighborhood businesses however can afford such protection even in collaboration with other local merchants 
 in the neighborhoods with the highest crime rates small business generally relies on the public police force for protection 
 this creates several problems 
 one is that there are not enough police to satisfy small businesses 
 the number one proposal for reducing crime in the new york survey was to put more police on foot or <unk> <unk> suggested by more than two-thirds of the respondents 
 only N N supported private security <unk> funded by the merchants themselves 
 a second problem is the persistent frustration of false <unk> which can make urban police less than enthusiastic about responding to calls from small businesses 
 only half the new york small businesses surveyed for their part are satisfied with the police response they receive 
 some cities including new york have <unk> with special tax districts for commercial areas that provide additional <unk> funded by local businesses 
 but this raises added cost barriers to urban <unk> 
 another solution cities might consider is giving special priority to police <unk> of small-business areas 
 for cities losing business to suburban shopping centers it may be a <unk> business investment to help keep those jobs and sales taxes within city limits 
 increased <unk> of business zones makes sense because urban crime is heavily concentrated in such hot spots of <unk> <unk> 
 with national institute of justice support the minneapolis police and the crime control institute are currently testing the effects of such a strategy <unk> its <unk> value with traditional random <unk> 
 small-business <unk> would be an especially helpful <unk> whenever a small-business person is scheduled to testify against a <unk> suspect 
 while no guarantee an increased police presence might even deter further attacks 
 it might even have saved the life and business of israel ortiz

 diversification pays 
 that 's a fundamental lesson for investors but its truth was demonstrated once again in the performance of mutual funds during and after the stock market 's friday-the-13th plunge 
 stock funds like the market as a whole generally dropped more than N N in the week through last thursday according to figures compiled by lipper analytical services inc 
 that reflects the huge drop a week ago friday last monday 's rebound and the <unk> and <unk> that followed 
 but several other types of funds <unk> investors from the worst of the market 's slide 
 funds that invest internationally were the <unk> stock and fixed-income funds 
 more than ever people should realize they should have a diversified portfolio said <unk> <unk> a senior vice president of vanguard group 
 that means stocks bonds money market instruments and real estate 
 one week 's performance should n't be the basis for any investment decision 
 but the latest mutual fund performance figures do show what can happen when the going gets rough 
 you want to know how a fund did when the market got <unk> said kurt brouwer an investment adviser with brouwer & <unk> in san francisco 
 it 's like <unk> the tires of a car 
 what you want to know is when the road 's rough when there 's snow and ice how 's this car going to perform 
 general equity funds fell an average of N N in the week ended thursday compared with a N N slide for the standard & poor 's 500-stock index 
 but lipper analytical 's figures show that there were a number of ways investors could have <unk> themselves from the stock market 's gyrations 
 <unk> funds for instance which invest in companies that mine and process the precious metal posted an average decline of N N 
 flexible portfolio funds which <unk> investments among stocks bonds and money-market instruments and other investments declined at about half the rate of stock funds an average drop of N N according to lipper 
 global allocation funds take the <unk> concept one step further by investing at least N N of their portfolios outside the u.s. 
 this gives them the added benefits of international diversification including a foreign-exchange boost during periods like the past week when the dollar declines against other major currencies 
 with all that going for them global flexible portfolio funds declined only N N in the week through last thursday 
 but while the merits of diversification <unk> through when times are tough there 's also a price to pay a diversified portfolio always <unk> an <unk> portfolio during those times when the investment in the <unk> portfolio is truly hot 
 and friday the 13th notwithstanding stocks have been this year 's hot investment 
 thus even including the latest week the average general stock fund has soared more than N N so far this year the lipper analytical figures show 
 by comparison global asset allocation funds have turned in an average total return of about N N while domestic flexible portfolios are up about N N 
 fixed-income funds have returned N N while gold funds which tend to be volatile have risen just N N on average 
 that 's the problem with trying to hedge too much said mr. brouwer 
 you do n't make any real money 
 over the last N years for example mr. brouwer says an investor putting $ N a year in the s&p N would have made nearly twice as much than if it were invested in treasury bills 
 some equity funds did better than others in the week that began on friday the 13th 
 the $ N million <unk> fund for instance was the seventh top performing fund for the week with a N N return 
 its return so far this year has been a credible N N 
 the fund 's strategy is to sell when a stock <unk> N N over its cost 
 by the time the market plummeted N days ago <unk> was N N in cash said robert <unk> president and portfolio manager 
 last monday he started buying the high-quality growth companies that people were throwing away at discount prices 
 among mr. <unk> 's picks <unk> systems reebok international ltd. and digital microwave corp 
 the fund 's cash position is now about N N which mr. <unk> calls still bearish 
 among the big stock funds dreyfus fund with more than $ N billion in assets had a decline of just N N for the week and a return of N N for the year 
 howard stein chairman of dreyfus corp. said the fund was about half invested in government bonds on oct. N and about N N in cash 
 in a downward market bonds act better he said 
 we still think there 's a lot of <unk> in this market 
 we believe interest rates will continue to trend lower and the economy will slow around the world 
 many of the funds that did best in the last week are heavily invested overseas giving them the benefit of foreign currency <unk> when the dollar is weak 
 from its high point on thursday oct. N to where it traded late in new york a week later the dollar fell N N against the west german mark N N against the british pound and N N against the japanese yen 
 three international cash portfolios funds which invest almost exclusively in bonds and money-market instruments overseas were among the four <unk> funds in the latest week 
 because the funds ' investments are <unk> in foreign currencies their value expressed in dollars goes up when those currencies rise against the dollar 
 but when the dollar rises against major foreign currencies as it did for much of this year the dollar value of these funds declines 
 all three funds posted negative returns for the year to date 
 of the funds that fared the worst in the <unk> N week two are heavily invested in airlines stocks which led the market slide following problems with financing for the ual corp buy-out plan 
 reflecting airline takeover activity however both the fidelity select air transportation portfolio and the national aviation & technology fund posted <unk> returns for the the year to date N N for the fidelity air transportation fund and a <unk> N N for national aviation & technology 
 the small drop in equity funds in general in the latest week may not necessarily be a good sign said a. michael lipper president of lipper analytical 
 noting that equity funds are up nearly N N from their post-crash low on dec. N N he said that what happened last week may not be enough of an adjustment 
 there 's either more to come or an extremely long period of <unk> 
 but investors do n't seem to think so 
 several big mutual fund groups said last week that cash flows into stock funds were heavier than usual after heavy outflows on the 13th 
 vanguard group said it had a more than $ N million net <unk> into its stock funds last week 
 there certainly has n't been a panic reaction said steven <unk> a vice president at t. rowe price associates 
 people showed some staying power and in fact interest in buying equities

 does n't anybody here want to win this mayor 's race 
 as they <unk> and <unk> toward election day two weeks from tomorrow both democrat david dinkins and republican rudolph giuliani are in trouble 
 mr. dinkins the manhattan borough president can afford more <unk> and <unk> because he holds a comfortable <unk> lead in most of the <unk> polls 
 but in the past N days he has taken a series of body <unk> to his pride and his reputation that could <unk> affect his ability to govern this tumultuous city should he become new york 's first black mayor 
 ordinarily a <unk> opponent would find a way to capitalize on the other side 's <unk> 
 but mr. giuliani a <unk> prosecutor has had difficulty switching from his <unk> <unk> mode to a political stance that suggests he might know something about running this big troubled city 
 and now at the crucial moment he 's running out of money 
 this is the nation 's biggest city and traditionally its mayor is the nation 's best-known urban politician 
 democrats hoped that mr. dinkins could become a highly visible national leader 
 republicans figured that in mr. giuliani the nation 's best-known prosecutor they had a chance for a huge upset in the heart of democratic territory and that they would pick up a new political star 
 but it has n't worked out that way 
 dinkins is a decent but sloppy guy says david <unk> veteran campaign consultant here who has always worked for mayor edward koch defeated by mr. dinkins in the sept. N democratic primary 
 the alternative giuliani is <unk> 
 i guess we 'll <unk> go ahead and do it vote for dinkins says richard wade a politically active professor who supported richard <unk> an <unk> in the democratic primary 
 there 's nothing on the other side 
 we 're picking up steam insists roger <unk> mr. giuliani 's media consultant whose last big campaign helped put george bush in the white house 
 he adds it just has n't gotten down to the engine room yet 
 but the steam may never reach the engine room 
 for just as mr. giuliani <unk> on to an issue that has mr. dinkins reeling his campaign desperately needs cash to keep mr. <unk> 's commercials on the air beyond wednesday or thursday 
 to help out this week the white house is <unk> chief of staff john <unk> and three cabinet members hud 's jack kemp transportation 's samuel skinner and treasury 's nicholas brady according to peter powers the giuliani campaign manager 
 for republicans who began this campaign with such high hopes all of this is deeply frustrating 
 historically new york is almost always in trouble 
 but the trouble it faces now under democratic rule seems bigger and more <unk> than anything it has faced in the past 
 this year the city faces a budget deficit that could become even bigger next year 
 and hardly surprising many residents trying to cope with the city 's other problems are constantly on edge one ethnic group <unk> with another 
 people were n't so happy in the 1930s says thomas <unk> another local professor and the <unk> of the legendary <unk> <unk> the city 's fusion mayor who built a coalition mr. giuliani hopes to <unk> 
 but at least back then they did n't generally direct their anger at each other 
 the <unk> mr. dinkins an <unk> has served as the city clerk and as manhattan borough president a job with limited executive responsibilities 
 i <unk> you to come up with one major <unk> of david dinkins says mr. giuliani 
 he defeated the contentious mr. koch in the democratic primary partly because he seemed to offer hope he could <unk> the city 's racial and ethnic <unk> 
 his <unk> campaign is almost <unk> all <unk> pictures and <unk> words 
 his theme is unity <unk> <unk> bringing new york together again 
 both candidates are negotiating about holding debates but mr. dinkins is widely seen as the major obstacle for scheduling them 
 the 45-year-old mr. giuliani has run a negative campaign to pick up votes <unk> to mr. dinkins 
 he 's got to get dinkins 's <unk> up says lee <unk> director of the <unk> college institute of public opinion 
 but our polls show voters do n't like the attack stuff 
 why even N N of the republican vote is going to dinkins 
 it 's <unk> politics says john <unk> mr. dinkins 's issues director insisting there is a strong <unk> <unk> to the giuliani effort 
 for the giuliani forces it 's a <unk> 
 on the one hand mr. giuliani wants to cut into mr. dinkins 's credibility 
 on the other he seeks to convince voters he 's the new <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and ready to lead new york out of the mess it 's in 
 it has n't helped that he 's <unk> on abortion and <unk> rights sought the support of both the liberal and conservative parties he won the liberal endorsement and that he turned to <unk> <unk> mason for help with jewish voters 
 mr. mason left the campaign after telling reporters mr. dinkins is a <unk> with a <unk> 
 <unk> is a <unk> <unk> word for a black person 
 mr. dinkins concedes nothing in his ability to <unk> and <unk> 
 he can match <unk> mason with his own robert <unk> carson an angry street <unk> who was convicted of <unk> in N 
 the dinkins campaign paid mr. carson close to $ N to get out the vote on <unk> day 
 paper work on how it was spent is incomplete 
 mr. carson has been charged with being <unk> 
 asked about that the other day he replied <unk> 
 i 'm <unk> 
 more troubling for mr. dinkins is his record in personal accounting 
 it began in N when he was being considered for deputy mayor and a routine check <unk> the extraordinary fact that he had n't paid his income tax for the previous four years 
 i was always going to do it tomorrow he explained at the time 
 and now he 's <unk> trying to explain an arrangement in which he sold stock in inner city broadcasting co. headed by his old friend and <unk> <unk> sutton to his son david dinkins jr. for $ N 
 he had valued the shares at more than $ N million two years earlier 
 he says he sold the stock to avoid <unk> problems in his role as a voting member of the city 's board of estimate 
 he says his son has n't paid for the shares 
 it looks like serious tax evasion says mr. <unk> the giuliani media consultant 
 it follows the same pattern as his tax returns 
 he <unk> to talk about it until after he gets caught 
 he simply has n't explained why something worth a million dollars ended up worth $ N two years later says mr. powers the giuliani campaign manager 
 it 's <unk> for him to suggest it 's the difference between <unk> value of the shares and their market value 
 so far though no one not even former u.s. attorney giuliani has been able to pinpoint just what law mr. dinkins has broken or just what tax he has <unk> 
 the crime goes to character says ron <unk> a consultant to the giuliani campaign 
 it 's serious stuff 
 he <unk> and ducks 
 he 's had a history of <unk> and this is the latest chapter 
 it makes people think maybe this guy is n't so <unk> clean after all says mr. <unk> mayor koch 's media consultant 
 the result may turn out to be a lot closer than people think

 winnebago industries inc. battered by a <unk> slowdown in recreational vehicle industry sales reported a widened fourth-quarter loss and slashed its dividend in half 
 the forest city iowa maker of motor homes said it had a loss of $ N million or N cents a share in the quarter ended aug. N 
 a year earlier the company had a deficit of $ N million or six cents a share 
 the cut in the dividend to N cents a share <unk> from N cents would indicate to me they do n't see the problems being fixed real quick said frank <unk> an analyst at <unk> <unk> inc. in minneapolis 
 indeed winnebago said it started several promotional programs to spur retail sales in the fall and winter 
 the year was already shaping up as a difficult one for the recreational vehicle industry which makes products such as motor homes travel <unk> <unk> <unk> and van <unk> 
 with the exception of van <unk> the industry has seen a decline from N 's robust sales 
 but the rate of the decline <unk> in august with unit sales to dealers for the month down N N from a year earlier according to the recreation vehicle industry association 
 at winnebago sales for the quarter fell N N to $ N million from $ N million a year earlier 
 the company attributed the decline to consumers ' concern over interest rates and gas prices two key expenses for <unk> buyers 
 it 's a <unk> discretionary purchase said robert <unk> who follows the industry for merrill lynch & co 
 so when there 's talk and concern about the economy it 's not <unk> for a portion of the buying public to defer purchases 
 mr. <unk> expects industry <unk> sales for all of N to fall about N N from N when sales of N units were the highest since N 
 and he said the weakness could continue in the first half of next year 
 but he said the industry has a good decade ahead particularly if aging baby boomers fulfill the industry 's dreams by buying <unk> 
 winnebago was hit especially hard in the latest downturn because unit sales in its bread-and-butter motor home business tumbled N N industrywide in august and N N in the first eight months of the year 
 the company said it also suffered in the quarter from incentive programs losses from <unk> a motor home line and costs of developing a new commercial vehicle among other things 
 the news sent winnebago stock falling N cents to $ N in new york stock exchange composite trading a 52-week low 
 the dividend cut will prove most costly for john k. hanson winnebago 's founder and chairman 
 based on his control of about N N of winnebago 's N million shares his annual dividend income would be cut to about $ N million from $ N million 
 for the year winnebago had a loss of $ N million or N cents a share following profit of $ N million or N cents a share a year earlier

 bullish bond market sentiment is on the rise again 
 as the government prepares to release the next batch of economic reports the consensus among economists and money managers is that the news will be negative 
 and that they say will be good for bonds 
 recent data have indicated somewhat weaker economic activity said elliott <unk> director of economic research at donaldson lufkin & jenrette securities 
 mr. <unk> is advising clients that the near-term direction of bond prices is likely to remain upward 
 analysts insist that even without help from a shaky stock market which provided a temporary boost for bonds during the oct. N stock market plunge bond prices will start to climb on the prospects that the federal reserve will allow interest rates to move lower in the coming weeks 
 that would be <unk> to fixed-income investors many of whom were badly burned in the third quarter by incorrectly assuming that the fed would ease 
 investors rushed to buy bonds during the summer as prices soared on speculation that interest rates would continue to fall 
 but when it became clear that rates had stabilized and that the fed 's <unk> policy was on hold bond yields jumped and prices tumbled 
 long-term bonds have performed <unk> this year 
 for example a group of long-term treasury bonds tracked by merrill lynch & co. produced a total return of N N in the first quarter N N in the second quarter and N N in the third quarter 
 total return is price changes plus interest income 
 now some investment analysts insist that the economic climate has turned cold and gloomy and they are urging clients to buy bonds before the rally begins 
 among other things economists note that consumer spending is slowing corporate profit margins are being squeezed business confidence is slipping and construction and manufacturing industries are depressed 
 at the same time last week 's consumer price index showed that inflation is <unk> 
 add it all up and it means that the fed has a little <unk> to ease its credit policy stance without the risk of <unk> inflation said norman robertson chief economist at mellon bank corp. pittsburgh 
 i think we will see a federal funds rate of close to N N N in the next two weeks and N N by year end 
 the federal funds rate which banks charge each other on overnight loans is considered an early signal of changes in the fed 's credit policy 
 economists generally agree that the rate was lowered by the fed from around N N where it had been since july to about N N N in early october on the heels of a weak employment report 
 although the rate briefly drifted even lower following the stock market sell-off that occurred oct. N it ended friday at about N N N 
 james <unk> chief fixed-income strategist at merrill lynch is touting <unk> securities which he says should benefit more quickly than longer-term bonds as interest rates fall 
 given our forecast for lower rates purchases made now should prove quite rewarding before year end he said 
 mr. <unk> also likes long-term investment-grade corporate bonds and long-term treasurys 
 he says these bonds should appreciate in value as some investors reacting to the recent turmoil in the stock and high-yield junk bond markets seek safer securities 
 if the tennessee valley authority sale is any guide there appears to be good demand for <unk> long-term paper from both domestic and overseas accounts he said 
 tva in its first public debt offering in N years sold $ N billion of long-term and <unk> securities last week 
 strong investor demand prompted the utility to boost the size of the issue from $ N billion 
 tva which operates one of the nation 's largest electric power systems is a corporation owned by the federal government 
 but <unk> investors to buy bonds may be especially tough this week when the u.s. government will auction more than $ N billion of new securities 
 today the treasury department will sell $ N billion of three-month and six-month bills at the regular weekly auction 
 tomorrow the treasury will sell $ N billion of two-year notes 
 resolution funding corp. known as refcorp a division of a new government agency created to bail out the nation 's troubled savings and loan associations will hold its first bond auction wednesday when it will sell $ N billion of 30-year bonds 
 all of this comes ahead of the government 's big quarterly refunding of the federal debt which takes place sometime in november 
 so far investors have n't shown much appetite for refcorp 's initial bond offering 
 roger early a portfolio manager at federated investors corp. said that yields on the so-called bailout bonds are n't high enough to attract his attention 
 why should i bother with something that 's an unknown for a very small pickup in yield he said 
 i 'm not going to jump on them the first day they come out 
 he seems to be typical of many professional money managers 
 when the size of the refcorp offering was announced last week and when-issued trading activity began the bailout bonds were yielding about N percentage point more than the treasury 's benchmark 30-year bond 
 on friday the yield was quoted at about N percentage point higher than the benchmark bond an indication of weak demand 
 some economists believe that yields on all treasury securities may rise this week as the market struggles to absorb the new supply 
 but once the new securities are <unk> they expect investors to focus on the weak economic data 
 the supply is not a <unk> to the market said samuel <unk> chief financial economist at kleinwort benson government securities inc 
 if one thinks that rates are going down you do n't care how much supply is coming 
 friday 's market activity 
 most bond prices fell on concerns about this week 's new supply and disappointment that stock prices did n't stage a sharp decline 
 junk bond prices moved higher however 
 in early trading treasury bonds were higher on expectations that a surge in buying among japanese investors would continue 
 also providing support to treasurys was hope that the stock market might see declines because of the expiration of some stock-index futures and options on indexes and individual stocks 
 those hopes were dashed when the stock market put in a relatively quiet performance 
 treasury bonds ended with losses of as much as N point or about $ N for each $ N face amount 
 the benchmark 30-year bond which traded as high as N N during the day ended at N N 
 the yield on the benchmark bond rose slightly to N N from N N 
 in the corporate bond market traders said the new-issue market for junk bonds is likely to pick up following chicago & north western acquisition corp. 's $ N million junk bond offering friday 
 today for example underwriters at morgan stanley & co. said they expect to price a $ N million 12-year senior subordinated debenture offering by imo industries inc 
 traders expect the issue to be priced to yield N N 
 shearson lehman hutton inc. said that a $ N million senior subordinated discount debenture issue by <unk> <unk> drugs is expected by the end of the month 
 however despite the big new-issue calendar many junk bond investors and analysts are skeptical the deals will get done 
 there are about a dozen more deals coming said michael <unk> director of fixed-income research at kemper financial services inc 
 if they had this much trouble with chicago & north western they are going to have an awful time with the rest 
 last week underwriters were forced to postpone three junk bond deals because of recent weakness in the market 
 and pressure by big investors forced donaldson lufkin & jenrette securities corp. to <unk> chicago & north western 's $ N million junk bond offering 
 after hours of negotiating that stretched late into thursday night underwriters priced the 12-year issue of <unk> senior subordinated debentures at par to yield N N higher than the N N that had been expected 
 the coupon on the issue will be reset in one year at a rate that will give the issue a market value of N 
 however the maximum coupon rate on the issue when it is reset is N N 
 debenture holders also will receive the equivalent of N N of the common stock in chicago & north western 's parent company 
 the coupon was raised to induce some of the big players on the <unk> to come in said a spokesman for donaldson 
 we put a price on the deal that the market required to get it done 
 the spokesman said the issue was sold out and met with strong interest abroad particularly from japanese investors 
 in the secondary or resale market junk bonds closed N point higher while investment-grade corporate bonds fell N to N point 
 sotheby 's inc. 's gamble in the <unk> business appears to have paid off 
 the new york arm of the london-based auction house auctioned off the estate of john t. dorrance jr. the campbell 's soup co. heir for $ N million last week a record for a <unk> art collection 
 that total was below the $ N million the auction house estimated the collection might sell for but was enough to ensure that an unprecedented financial arrangement sotheby 's had made with the dorrance family proved profitable to the auction house 
 sotheby 's provided the dorrance family a guarantee of at least $ N million and as much as $ N million to obtain the collection people familiar with the transaction said thus taking a greater than usual financial interest in the property to be sold 
 the dorrance estate auctioned off in a series of sales held over four days included <unk> furniture and paintings 
 an <unk> <unk> auctioned last wednesday <unk> $ N million a world record for the artist 
 in addition a handful of paintings from the dorrance collection remain to be sold at sotheby 's annual old masters paintings auction in january

 further mccaw said the banks expressed confidence that the balance of the $ N billion bank facility will be committed within the next several weeks by a syndicate of foreign and domestic banks 
 morgan <unk> and <unk> are leading that syndicate 
 mccaw is offering to buy N million shares of lin for $ N each in cash which would result in mccaw owning N N of the <unk> and broadcasting concern

 a majority of japanese banks are said to be wary of making new loans to mexico under the brady plan because they 're uncertain the mexican economy will remain stable 
 instead many small and medium-sized banks and some larger ones are likely to take one of the other two options open to them under the plan japanese banking officials said 
 the plan proposed by u.s. secretary of state nicholas brady calls for banks either to make new loans or to reduce the principle on existing loans or to cut the interest rate on those existing loans 
 the officials said that most japanese banks prefer the losses they 'd suffer in either of the latter options to the risk of new lending 
 but an official at a long-term credit bank explained that since some larger banks have already taken loss provisions for loans to other third world nations further write-offs could be viewed as <unk> 
 they ca n't take the hit to their earnings he said 
 as a result the official said they may be forced into a <unk> situation in which they make risky loans that they could have to write off later

 ekco group inc. nashua n.h. expects to report that net income in the third quarter ended oct. N fell N N to N N from $ N million or N cents a share a year earlier 
 robert stein president and chief executive officer attributed the expected decline partly to the effects of a <unk> strike last month at the company 's <unk> ohio <unk> facility 
 <unk> orders in early september also played a role he said in an interview 
 but mr. stein said he is reasonably confident that earnings for the full year will exceed the $ N million or N cents a share in N 
 that would require fourth-quarter net of more than about N cents to N cents a share assuming that mr. stein 's third-quarter estimate proves accurate 
 in the year-earlier fourth quarter the company had profit of $ N million or N cents a share 
 third-quarter revenue is expected to be $ N million to $ N million up from $ N million a year earlier according to neil gordon treasurer 
 the year-earlier periods do n't reflect results of the company 's <unk> corp. unit acquired last january but include some canadian operations that were sold at the end of N 
 august through october traditionally is the busiest season for the <unk> business as many retailers use the goods as autumn promotional items 
 mr. stein said some retailers perhaps anxious about <unk> inventories appear to have held back on orders in september but have been ordering more heavily in october 
 mr. stein said <unk> is marginally profitable but has n't performed as well as expected 
 <unk> 's <unk> <unk> and other <unk> products are doing very well and its plastic <unk> products are poised for growth he said 
 but the unit 's third segment wildlife <unk> is suffering from a depressed market and ekco is seeking to sell that segment he said 
 mr. stein said he expects profit to be higher in N than in N reflecting a number of measures taken since the acquisition of ekco <unk> in late N 
 prior to acquiring the <unk> business the company was known as <unk> corp. <unk> had been a maker of computer printers but mr. stein and other officers decided to sell that business after japanese competitors grabbed a dominant share of the market 
 mr. stein said tighter operating controls have enabled ekco to reduce inventory levels N N to N N improve <unk> delivery of orders to about N N from around N N and to lower the number of labor hours required to produce a unit 
 by moving the design of new products in-house instead of contracting out the work the company also has been able to come up with designs that can be manufactured more efficiently he said 
 in addition to those measures the company spent heavily earlier this year to install displays at its customers ' retail outlets a strategy that mr. stein said has helped bolster awareness of the company 's brands 
 ekco 's <unk> operation makes kitchen tools and <unk> as well as <unk> at factories in the u.s. and canada 
 the main issue in the strike at the ohio facility was health-care benefits mr. stein said 
 the strike ended <unk> 
 ekco continues to seek further acquisitions in the consumer-products industry mr. stein said 
 he indicated that ekco may be interested in acquiring another company with revenue in the range of $ N million to $ N million partly because mass <unk> increasingly want to rely on larger and fewer suppliers 
 after several years of booming business with china foreign traders are bracing for the biggest slump in a decade 
 the <unk> of <unk> measures starting last october already had begun to <unk> when the massacre in <unk> square on june N and subsequent events <unk> the belt far tighter 
 foreign lending has been virtually suspended since then <unk> liquidity and <unk> many projects 
 and beijing has pulled back on domestic loans and subsidies leaving many domestic buyers and <unk> plants strapped for cash 
 <unk> far east ltd. a swiss concern that sells chemicals to <unk> and soap factories in china <unk> the problems

 the june killings magnified the problems 
 in canton <unk> 's representative office received no orders in june 
 at first it attributed the slump to temporary business disruptions but when no orders were <unk> in august and september manager donald <unk> became convinced that business would be bad for many months 
 things have grown worse since june N mr. <unk> says 
 he predicts that sales will drop between N N and N N from last year 's $ N million 
 the consumer-products and <unk> sectors are bearing the brunt of china 's <unk> measures and foreign companies such as <unk> that deal with those industries are being hit the hardest 
 but in general all <unk> companies are feeling the <unk> 
 the import pie will shrink says john <unk> first vice president of the american chamber of commerce in hong kong and a china trade specialist 
 on the down side sales could fall as much as N N for some companies on the upper side sales will be flat 
 china 's foreign trade has gone in cycles during the past decade 
 the last time that traders experienced a trough was during N when beijing imposed tough measures to curb imports and <unk> foreign exchange 
 the current trough is expected to be much deeper because beijing has cut off domestic funds from factories for the first time to slow inflation 
 in addition the suspension of loans and export credits from foreign governments and institutions following the june killings have been a big setback 
 the freeze on new lending is dealing the single biggest blow to trading says raymond <unk> china manager for <unk> ag a west german <unk> company 
 import growth from the year-earlier months slowed to N N in july and N N in august compared with an average growth rate of N N in the first half 
 in the first eight months of N imports grew N N to $ N billion down slightly from a growth rate of N N a year earlier 
 the picture for china 's exports is just as bleak mainly because of the domestic credit squeeze 
 exports in the first eight months grew only N N to $ N billion compared with a growth rate of N N a year earlier according to chinese customs figures 
 the threat to china 's balance of payments is further <unk> by the plunge in its foreign-exchange reserves excluding gold holdings 
 the reserves dropped for the first time in recent years to $ N billion in june from $ N billion in april 
 the trend has prompted beijing to intensify efforts to curb imports 
 in recent weeks china 's leaders have <unk> trading in <unk> and scores of chemical products and commodities 
 the ministry of foreign economic relations and trade set up a special bureau last month to monitor the issue of import and export licenses 
 beijing 's periodic <unk> on imports have taught many trading companies that the best way to get through the drought is by helping china export 
 for example <unk> <unk> corp. one of the biggest japanese trading houses now buys almost twice as many goods from china as it sells to that country 
 three years ago the ratio was reversed 
 but the strategy is n't helping much this time 
 both sectors of imports and exports look just as bad says <unk> <unk> general manager of <unk> <unk> 's canton office 
 he expects the company 's trading business to drop as much as N N this year 
 for a short time after june N it appeared that the trade picture would remain fairly bright 
 many foreign trading offices in hong kong were <unk> with <unk> and telephone calls from chinese trade officials urging them not to <unk> ties 
 even the bank of china which normally took weeks to process letters of credit was settling the letters at record speed to <unk> rumors about the bank 's financial health 
 but when foreign traders tried to do business they discovered that the eagerness of chinese trade officials was just a <unk> 
 the suspension of foreign loans has weakened the buying power of china 's national trading companies which are among the country 's biggest <unk> 
 business is n't any better on the <unk> or municipal level foreign traders say 
 shanghai investment & trust co. known as <unk> is the city 's main financier for trading business 
 <unk> had <unk> tapped the japanese bond market for funds but it ca n't do that any longer 
 foreign traders say the company is strapped for cash 
 it has difficulties paying its foreign debts says a hong kong executive who is familiar with <unk> 's business 
 how can it make available funds for purchases 
 foreign traders also say many of china 's big <unk> projects have been canceled or postponed because of the squeeze on domestic and foreign credit 
 albert lee a veteran trader who specializes in machinery sales estimates that as many as N N of projects that had obtained approval to proceed have been canceled in recent months 
 there are virtually no new projects and that means no new business for us he says 
 even when new lending <unk> foreign exchange would still be tight because beijing will likely try to rein in foreign borrowing which has grown between N N and N N in the past few years 
 and foreign creditors are likely to be more cautious about extending new loans because china is <unk> a peak repayment period as many loans start falling due in the next two to five years 
 another reason for the intensity of the trade problems is that beijing has extended the current <unk> on imports beyond the usual target of consumer products to include steel chemical <unk> and plastics 
 these have been among the country 's leading imports particularly last year when there were shortages that led many traders to buy heavily and pay <unk> 
 but the shortages also spawned rampant speculation and <unk> prices 
 to stem speculation beijing imposed ceiling prices that went into effect earlier this year 
 traders who had bought the goods at prices above the ceiling do n't want to take a loss on <unk> and are holding onto their stock 
 the resulting <unk> has depressed the market 
 but beijing ca n't cut back on such essential imports as raw materials for too long without <unk> the country 's export business 
 mr. <unk> the china trade expert estimates that as much as N N of <unk> 's exports is made up of processed imported raw materials

 the fund is required to pay claims up to an additional $ N million 
 the fund 's purpose is to provide quick and adequate relief 
 but the <unk> bay case the fund 's first test shows how easily the fund can be undermined 
 <unk> corp. is <unk> liability 
 it claims the coast guard failed to chart the rock and refuses to pay damages 
 that means the fund is n't obligated to pay anything at least so far

 mr. <unk> manages to invest this tale of financial wars with the <unk> characters and <unk> action of a <unk> novel

 high-definition television promises to be the tv of tomorrow so it is a natural multibillion-dollar market 
 although major u.s. manufacturers have all but <unk> the main segment of that future business to japan not everyone here is ready to give up 
 a handful of small u.s. companies are struggling to develop the technology to build the screens for the thin high-quality <unk> that are expected to hang on living room walls by the end of the 1990s 
 with only small help from the government these start-up concerns are trying to compete with the <unk> of the japanese consumer electronics industry which enjoy considerable backing from the japanese government 
 <unk> technology inc. of <unk> ohio aims to use a new form of <unk> technology to put <unk> images on a tv display that is N inches in <unk> but only a few inches thick 
 <unk> systems inc. of <unk> ore. the largest of these firms with $ N million in annual revenue has similar plans 
 it already has had success in <unk> another promising technology <unk> for high-definition television 
 two other firms <unk> <unk> systems inc. of <unk> mich. and <unk> corp. of pittsburgh are developing a <unk> of the <unk> screens called <unk> liquid crystal displays 
 the new technologies are intended to retire the <unk> tube which accounts for most of the bulk of the conventional tv set 
 replacing the <unk> tube with a large thin screen is the key to the creation of a high-definition television or hdtv which is expected to become a $ N billion business world-wide within a decade 
 large u.s. companies are interested in other segments of the hdtv business such as <unk> and broadcast equipment 
 but except for zenith electronics corp. and international business machines corp. which is <unk> with toshiba on computer displays they are poorly positioned to exploit advances in large panels 
 general electric co. recently sold off its interests in <unk> displays to <unk> of france 
 we found the market not developing as we thought it would a ge spokesman says 
 the small u.s. firms are <unk> because of their strong positions in patents and because the prize is still there to be seized 
 no one yet has shown the ability to manufacture these panels at commercial costs says <unk> <unk> the president of <unk> <unk> 
 he says he thinks his company is just a few years from doing that 
 the bush administration hearing <unk> advice about what its role in hdtv should be is n't doing much for now 
 the only material support it is extending to the struggling u.s. industry is $ N million in <unk> from the pentagon 's defense advanced research projects agency 
 the <unk> funds are a <unk> compared with what japan and other prospective competitors are spending 
 the commerce department estimates that japanese government and industry spending on hdtv research is already over $ N billion 
 unless it gets more help the u.s. industry wo n't have a chance says peter <unk> <unk> 's executive vice president 
 thus far almost all of the basic technology relating to high-definition television has come from u.s. laboratories 
 but peter <unk> <unk> 's president says japanese companies are poised to <unk> the technology and put it to commercial use just as they did with earlier u.s. <unk> in color television and video recording 
 in the 1970s mr. <unk> helped develop the first display panels based on <unk> liquid crystals at westinghouse electric corp. 's research labs in pittsburgh 
 the panels are like <unk> semiconductors surfaced with a million or more picture elements each contributing to the color and tone of a tv image 
 in N however westinghouse abandoned the project along with its stake in advanced television 
 mr. <unk> left the company to find other backers 
 he has a claim to the right to <unk> the westinghouse patents but he contends that those patents are being infringed by a number of japanese producers 
 most american investors have just given up mr. <unk> says 
 they are n't prepared to compete in an area where the japanese want to enter 
 many critics question the industry 's need for federal support the pentagon justifies its help on <unk> grounds 
 we do n't see a domestic source for some of our hdtv requirements and that 's a source of concern says michael kelly director of <unk> 's defense manufacturing office 
 so <unk> is trying to keep the industry interested in developing large display panels by <unk> out research funds 
 hdtv already has some military applications such as creating realistic flight <unk> and <unk> information to combat <unk> 
 the navy is ordering displays for its <unk> <unk> and the army wants smaller versions for its abrams battle tanks 
 the commerce department also is trying to encourage hdtv because of the benefits that could spin off to the semiconductor and computer industries 
 it is n't just <unk> television argues jack clifford director of the department 's office of <unk> and instrumentation 
 the industry will create industrial products such as displays for work stations and medical diagnostic equipment before it acquires a mass consumer market 
 although some hdtv advocates are calling for other forms of aid such as antitrust relief for research <unk> the small firms simply would prefer more <unk> funds 
 each claims to <unk> the right technology and wants just a bit more money to make it commercial 
 they also want u.s. trade policy to reflect the pentagon and commerce department 's concern over their future 
 they all are strongly opposed to a petition from several japanese tv manufacturers including <unk> hitachi and toshiba to exempt portable color tvs with <unk> displays from <unk> duties that the u.s. imposes on the larger japanese color tvs 
 and they want the u.s. to help them sell overseas 
 <unk> president james <unk> says he has to pay tariffs as high as N N to sell his display panels in japan and south korea while panels from those countries enter the u.s. duty-free 
 this is n't a technology issue but an attitude issue he says 
 we just have n't learned what it takes to compete

 the office of thrift supervision banned <unk> <unk> a former director of the failed vision banc savings association of <unk> texas from working in any financial institution insured by the government 
 the office a treasury department unit that is the successor to the federal home loan bank board said this was the first announcement of an enforcement action since this year 's <unk> legislation ordered that all such actions by federal banking regulators be made public 
 generally regulators have n't announced enforcement actions in the past

 they are starting to buy growth stocks

 the upper <unk> of this group were shares of the <unk> N companies whose profits of the 1960s and early 1970s grew steadily if not <unk> through thick and thin 
 that sort of <unk> performance sounds made to order for a time when corporate profits overall have been weakening from the brisk increases of recent years 
 the current flood of third-quarter reports are producing many more negative surprises than positive ones 
 those are unwelcome trends in a year that the dow jones industrial average has risen N N so far even with the 190.58-point plunge on oct. N broader market measures are in the same neighborhood 
 the question for investors is how to protect these returns and yet reach a little for additional gains 
 that 's the path of <unk> leading to growth stocks 
 i think it is a good theme for what looks to be an uncertain market says steven einhorn partner at goldman sachs 
 growth stocks may be as big as philip morris or medium-sized such as circuit city stores but their common characteristic is a history of increasing profits on the order of at least N N to N N a year money managers say 
 the period when growth stocks should be performing well is when their earnings are growing at a superior rate to the general level of corporate profits says stephen boesel president of t. rowe price 's growth and income fund 
 growth stocks also are attractive in periods of market volatility which many investors and analysts expect in the weeks ahead as everybody tries to <unk> where the economy is heading

 when they are buying back stock at N times earnings they are suggesting that the rate of return on competing internal projects is below returns on the stock 
 ibm says it considers its shares a good investment 
 but not all strategists or money managers are ready to throw in the towel completely on <unk> 
 growth stocks may <unk> cyclical stocks next year if the federal reserve begins to let interest rates <unk> sufficiently lower to boost the economy

 the collapse of a $ N billion buy-out of united airlines parent ual corp. has handed wall street 's takeover stock speculators their worst loss ever on a single deal 
 their $ N <unk> in estimated paper losses easily tops the $ N million in paper losses the takeover traders known as arbitragers suffered in N when gulf oil co. dropped a $ N billion offer for cities service co 
 in the six trading days since the ual labor-management buy-out group failed to get bank financing <unk> friday with the withdrawal of its partner british airways plc ual stock has plummeted by N N to N N from N N 
 the <unk> may recoup some of their paper losses if the ual deal gets <unk> up again as they did in N when occidental petroleum co. <unk> them with a $ N billion takeover of cities service 
 in the meantime the question faced by investors is what is ual stock worth 
 the short answer on a fundamental basis is that airline analysts say the stock is worth somewhere between $ N and $ N a share 
 that 's based on a multiple of anywhere between N to N times ual earnings which are estimated to come in somewhere around $ N a share this year 
 airline stocks typically sell at a discount of about one-third to the stock market 's price-earnings ratio which is currently about N times earnings 
 that 's because airline earnings like those of auto makers have been subject to the cyclical <unk> of the economy 
 that analysis matches up with stock traders ' reports that despite the huge drop in the stock ual has n't returned to the level at which it could attract buying by institutions solely on the basis of earnings 
 so anyone buying the stock now is betting on some special transaction such as a recapitalization or takeover and must do so using some <unk> about the likelihood of such an event 
 one analyst who asked not to be identified said he believes that the ual pilots and management can put together a bid in the $ N area but that it could take three to four months to close 
 at that level and given the uncertainty he believes ual stock should trade closer to 
 other observers note that ual 's board having accepted a bid of $ N a share might hold out for a new bid much closer to the original level even if it means that the management goes back to running the company for a while and lets things return to normal 
 by that logic the closing of a deal could be much further away than three to four months even though the eventual price might be higher 
 investment bankers following ual agree that the strongest impetus for an eventual deal is that the pilots have been attempting a buy-out for more than two years and are n't likely to stop having come so close to success 
 the pilots have a strong financing tool in their willingness to cut their annual compensation by $ N million and to commit $ N million from their retirement funds 
 on friday they also persuaded the ual flight attendants to join them 
 however investment bankers say that banks are n't likely to lend the almost $ N billion that would be necessary for a takeover even at a lower price without someone putting up a hefty <unk> of cash probably even greater than the N N in cash put up by investors in the leveraged takeover of northwest airlines parent nwa corp. in july 
 banks want to see someone putting up real cash at risk that is subordinate to the bank debt in any deal 
 that way they figure someone else has an even stronger <unk> to make sure the deal is going to work because they would be losing their money before the banks lost theirs 
 banks also want to be able to call someone on the telephone to fix a problem with a deal that goes bad <unk> someone other than a union leader 
 that leaves the pilots still in need of cash totaling around $ N billion far more than either they or the flight attendants can lay their hands on from retirement funds alone 
 one obstacle to the pilots ' finding such a huge amount of cash is their insistence on majority ownership 
 investors such as marvin davis of los angeles who have sought airline ownership this year have insisted they not the pilots must have control 
 one way out of that dilemma could be a partial recapitalization in which the pilots would wind up sharing the value of their concessions with public shareholders 
 the pilots could borrow against the value of their concessions using the proceeds to buy back stock from the public and give themselves the majority control they have been seeking 
 but it is n't clear that banks would lend sufficient money to deliver a big enough price to shareholders 
 the lack of any new cash probably would still leave the banks <unk> 
 in advising the ual board on the various bids for the airline starting with one for $ N a share from mr. davis the investment bank of first boston came up with a wide range of potential values for the company depending on <unk> methods and assumptions 
 using the the nwa takeover as a benchmark first boston on sept. N estimated that ual was worth $ N to $ N a share based on ual 's results for the N months ending last june N but only $ N to $ N based on a management estimate of results for N 
 first boston 's estimates had been higher before management supplied a N projection 
 using estimates of the company 's future earnings under a variety of scenarios first boston estimated ual 's value at $ N to $ N a share if its future labor costs conform to wall street projections $ N to $ N if the company reaches a settlement with pilots similar to one at nwa $ N to $ N under an adverse labor settlement and $ N to $ N under a pilot contract imposed by the company following a strike 
 and using liquidation value assuming the sale of all ual assets first boston estimated the airline is worth $ N to $ N a share 
 unfortunately all those estimates came before airline industry fundamentals deteriorated during the past month 
 american airlines parent amr and usair group both subject to takeover efforts themselves have each warned of declining results 
 some analysts do n't expect a quick revival of any takeover by the pilots 
 the deal has as one takeover expert puts it so many moving parts 
 i do n't see anybody who 's sophisticated getting his name associated with this mess until the moving parts stop moving 
 in addition to the need for another cash equity investor the other moving parts include the pilots themselves who can scuttle rival deals by threatening to strike the machinists union the pilots ' longtime rivals who helped scuttle the pilots ' deal and regulators in washington whose opposition to foreign airline investment helped throw the deal into doubt 
 in the meantime the <unk> are bleeding 
 wall street traders and analysts estimate that takeover stock traders own ual stock and options equal to as many as N million shares or about N N of the total outstanding

 troubled saatchi & saatchi co. has attracted offers for some of its advertising units with potential suitors including interpublic group but has rejected them people familiar with the company said 
 industry executives said interpublic approached saatchi in august about buying its <unk> unit but was turned down by chairman maurice saatchi 
 more recently interpublic <unk> about one of saatchi 's smaller communications companies identified as the <unk> public relations firm by several industry executives but again was rebuffed they said 
 interpublic 's chairman and chief executive officer philip <unk> jr. made the pitches in visits to mr. saatchi in london the executives said 
 a saatchi spokesman declined to comment about interpublic 
 but the spokesman confirmed that saatchi has received several inquiries from companies interested in acquiring its <unk> and <unk> units

 it rebuffed an offer by carl spielvogel head of saatchi 's backer spielvogel bates unit to lead a management buy-out of all or part of saatchi 
 and last week people close to saatchi said maurice saatchi and his brother charles would lead a buy-out if a hostile bid emerged 
 but saatchi 's troubles have only <unk> up interest among outsiders interested in picking off pieces of its ad businesses 
 while saatchi 's major agency networks backer spielvogel and saatchi & saatchi advertising would be difficult for any ad firm to buy because of potential client conflicts its smaller businesses are quite attractive 
 <unk> for example has had big problems at its new york office but offers strong offices in other areas of the country including minneapolis and chicago 
 that would would make it appealing to a network such as interpublic that already has a healthy new york presence 
 while there would be some client conflicts they would n't be nearly as onerous as with saatchi 's other agencies 
 <unk> also would be a sizable addition to an agency network it has billings of about $ N million and blue-chip clients including general mills <unk> and dow brands 
 <unk> meanwhile has expanded aggressively and now ranks as the <unk> u.s. public relations firm according to <unk> <unk> of public relations firms 
 it would be attractive to an agency such as interpublic one of the few big agency groups without an affiliated public relations firm of its own 
 other saatchi units include ad agency <unk> & mccall which has the mercedes account and which has been attempting to buy itself back and howard <unk> a sports and event marketing firm

 both of dr. baltimore 's public faces have been on view the past few weeks while he was under consideration to succeed <unk> <unk> as head of the prestigious rockefeller research institution 
 it came to light that a substantial number of rockefeller 's faculty were upset over or even opposed to dr. baltimore 's impending appointment 
 they were <unk> at what they regarded as dr. baltimore 's <unk> attitude toward the dingell committee which held hearings on a dispute over the lab <unk> of a researcher who had <unk> a scientific paper with dr. baltimore 
 readers of these columns the science police may N will recall that dr. baltimore was merely the most well-known part of the dingell committee 's larger investigation which touched mit <unk> duke the national institutes of health and elsewhere

 we see a whole <unk> of programs that will impose significant costs on the american economy in the form of <unk> regulation and higher liabilities 
 federal child care quack 
 the clean air bill quack 
 the <unk> bill quack quack 
 the bush white house is breeding <unk> ducks the same way the nixon white house did it <unk> on an issue that is <unk> cleaner air better treatment of the disabled better child care 
 it comes up with a <unk> version of a democratic proposal 
 the bill gets signed into law and then the administration watches <unk> wondering where all the unexpected costs came from 
 consider for instance the very fat <unk> known as <unk> child care 
 the president came up with a good bill but now may end up signing the awful bureaucratic <unk> <unk> on capitol hill 
 it would create N local <unk> commissions <unk> to the department of health and human services 
 they 'd determine where parents could store their kids during the day and they 'd regulate the storage facilities 
 the initial costs are said to be in the $ N billion a year range but that 's only the beginning 
 new <unk> tend to grow creating a rationale for new taxes 
 quack 
 the administration claims that its clean air bill will cost businesses between $ N billion and $ N billion annually but economist michael evans estimates that the costs for firms will actually be in the $ N billion a year range 
 the house bill also <unk> economic efficiency in all sorts of <unk> ways 
 for example the administration proposal imposes extremely tough emissions standards on new power plants 
 so instead of building more efficient modern plants utilities stick <unk> on the old plants 
 the money spent on <unk> is diverted from planned research on new cleaner technology

 the effect of nixon era <unk> ducks was an economy <unk> up with regulations and <unk> 
 all this was recognized and <unk> in the succeeding years by economists some of whom worked in the reagan administration to lift this burden from the american people states and local governments 
 running for president in N and N george bush also <unk> <unk> the economic <unk> of the 1970s 
 in fact during last year 's campaign the entire nation constantly heard mr. bush <unk> his <unk> as head of the task force on regulatory relief 
 government continues to inhibit the productivity of our <unk> and the international competitiveness of american business the vice president declared when he was head of the task force 
 but with the impending passage of these new programs mr. bush will surely be sending many people <unk> back into the regulatory <unk> that he had helped cut back 
 by N the number of federal regulators was down to about N 
 then it turned up and by one estimate the number will be up to about N regulators by next year 
 holding the dam on taxes is the most important task of the bush presidency 
 we would have thought by now though that there was a significant core of people involved in government life who understood that direct taxation is n't the only way to slow down an economy 
 it is merely the most obvious 
 what is even more ironic is that all over the world nations are learning that <unk> public programs often <unk> 
 but while they are unloading these burdens the united states is close to creating three more big ones 
 the bush administration ought to be setting aside some of its <unk> for the <unk> ducks 
 confidence in the pound is widely expected to take another sharp dive if trade figures for september due for release tomorrow fail to show a substantial improvement from july and august 's <unk> deficits 
 chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson 's restated commitment to a firm monetary policy has helped to prevent a <unk> in sterling over the past week 
 but analysts <unk> underlying support for sterling has been eroded by the chancellor 's failure to announce any new policy measures in his mansion house speech last thursday 
 this has increased the risk of the government being forced to increase base rates to N N from their current N N level to defend the pound economists and foreign exchange market analysts say 
 the risks for sterling of a bad trade figure are very heavily on the down side said chris <unk> senior u.k. economist at nomura research institute 
 if there is another bad trade number there could be an awful lot of pressure noted simon <unk> u.k. economist for midland <unk> a unit of midland bank plc 
 forecasts for the trade figures range widely but few economists expect the data to show a very marked improvement from the # N billion $ N billion deficit in the current account reported for august 
 the august deficit and the # N billion gap registered in july are topped only by the # N billion deficit of october N 
 <unk> <unk> european economist at baring brothers & co. said there is no sign that britain 's manufacturing industry is <unk> itself to boost exports 
 at the same time he remains fairly pessimistic about the outlook for imports given continued high consumer and capital goods inflows 
 he <unk> the current account deficit will narrow to only # N billion in september 
 however mr. <unk> said he believes that a reduction in raw material <unk> by industry could lead to a sharp drop in imports 
 combined with at least some rebound in exports after august 's unexpected decline the deficit could narrow to as little as # N billion 
 mr. <unk> who also forecasts a # N billion current account gap warns that even if the trade figures are bullish for sterling the currency wo n't advance much because investors will want to see further evidence of the turnaround before adjusting positions 
 nevertheless he noted no one will want to go into the trade figures without a flat position in the pound 
 meanwhile overall evidence on the economy remains fairly <unk> 
 in his mansion house speech mr. lawson warned that a further slowdown can be expected as the impact of the last rise in interest rates earlier this month takes effect 
 u.k. base rates are at their highest level in eight years 
 but consumer expenditure data released friday do n't suggest that the u.k. economy is slowing that quickly 
 the figures show that spending rose N N in the third quarter from the second quarter and was up N N from a year ago 
 this compares with a N N rise in the second from the first quarter and a N N increase from the second quarter of N 
 mr. <unk> said the data show the economy is still quite strong but suggestions that much of the spending went on services rather than consumer goods should reduce fears of more import rises 
 certainly the chancellor has made it clear that he is prepared to increase interest rates again if necessary to both ensure that a substantial slowdown does take place and that sterling does n't decline further 
 thursday he reminded his audience that the government can not allow the necessary <unk> of monetary policy to be undermined by exchange rate weakness 
 analysts agree there is little holding sterling firm at the moment other than mr. lawson 's promise that rates will be pushed higher if necessary 
 and they warn any further drop in the government 's popularity could swiftly make this promise sound <unk> 
 sterling was already showing some signs of a lack of confidence in mr. lawson 's promise friday 
 in european trading it declined to $ N and N marks from $ N and N marks late thursday 
 economists suggested that if the pound falls much below N marks the government will be forced to increase rates to N N both to halt any further decline and ensure that the balance of monetary policy remains unchanged

 freight rates declining for most of the decade because of competition spurred by deregulation are <unk> out turning upward and threatening to fuel inflation 
 trucking shipping and air-freight companies have announced rate increases scheduled for this fall or early next year reflecting higher costs and tightened demand for freight transport 
 major shippers say they expect freight rates to rise at least as fast as inflation and maybe faster in the next few years 
 that 's a big change from recent years when freight <unk> was a bright spot for u.s. productivity helping to restrain inflation and make u.s. industry more competitive abroad 
 demand has caught up with the supply of certain types of freight transportation and rates are starting to move up at a rate close to or slightly more than the inflation rate said clifford <unk> director of <unk> at du pont co 
 shippers surveyed recently by ohio state university said they expect their <unk> storage and distribution costs to rise about N N this year 
 only N N of the N shippers polled expected their <unk> costs to decrease compared with N N who had looked to freight transport to reduce costs in past years 
 this is the first year since transportation deregulation in N that we have had such a dramatic and broad-based <unk> in perceived transportation rates said bernard <unk> a transportation <unk> professor at ohio state in columbus 
 the deregulation of <unk> and trucking companies that began in N enabled shippers to bargain for transportation 
 carriers could use their equipment more efficiently leading to overcapacity they were eager to fill 
 shippers cut about $ N billion from their annual <unk> truck and rail costs to about $ N billion or about N N of gross national product down from N N of gnp in N 
 but with much of the <unk> squeezed out of the <unk> system rising costs are likely to be reflected directly in higher freight rates 
 shippers are saying the party 's over said mr. <unk> 
 shippers wo n't be able to look for <unk> savings as they have for the last eight or nine years 
 transport rates wo n't be an opportunity for offsetting cost increases in other segments of the economy 
 robert <unk> a consultant at arthur d. little inc. cambridge mass. said we 've gotten all the benefits of deregulation in <unk> reductions 
 now we are starting to see real <unk> increases as carriers replace equipment pay higher fuel costs and pay more for labor 
 you 'll see carriers try to recoup some of the price cutting that occurred previously 
 not everyone believes that the good times are over for shippers 
 there 's still a lot of pressure on rates in both rail and truck said gerard <unk> <unk> in transportation at massachusetts institute of technology 
 <unk> companies which carry the freight of several shippers in each truck <unk> discounted away a N N rate increase implemented last april 
 the carriers were competing fiercely for market share 
 <unk> increases are likely to be <unk> by weakening <unk> levels and keen competition for freight from trucks 
 an official at consolidated <unk> inc. a menlo park calif. <unk> carrier said rate discounting in that industry has begun to stabilize 
 consolidated <unk> plans to raise its rates N N late this year or early next year and at least two competitors have announced similar increases 
 <unk> are trying to send signals that they need to stop the <unk> forget about market share and go for higher rates said michael lloyd an analyst at salomon <unk> 
 and shippers are getting the feeling that they have played one <unk> off against another as much as they can he said 
 air-freight carriers raised their rates for u.s. products going across the pacific to asia by about N N earlier this month 
 and japan air lines said it plans to boost its rates a further N N over the next two years 
 such rate increases will increase the total cost of u.s. products and slow down the rate of increase of u.s. exports said richard <unk> a senior vice president of <unk> air & sea service u.s.a. inc. the u.s. <unk> subsidiary of nippon <unk> <unk> of japan 
 ship companies carrying bulk commodities such as oil grain coal and iron <unk> have been able to increase their rates in the last couple of years 
 some bulk shipping rates have increased N N to N N in the past few months said salomon 's mr. lloyd 
 and ship lines carrying containers are also trying to raise their rates 
 carriers boosted rates more than N N in the north atlantic between the u.s. and europe last september hoping to partly restore rates to earlier levels 
 ship lines operating in the pacific plan to raise rates on containers carrying u.s. exports to asia about N N effective next april

 bob stone <unk> over a letter from his manager putting him on <unk> for <unk> 
 mr. stone thought the discipline was unfair he believed that his manager wanted to get rid of him for personal reasons 
 unable to persuade the manager to change his decision he went to a company court for a hearing 
 at the scheduled time mr. stone entered a conference room in a building near where he worked 
 after the three members of the court introduced themselves the chairman of the panel said go ahead and tell us what happened 
 we may ask questions as you go along or we may wait until the end 
 no lawyers or tape recorders were present 
 the only extra people were a couple of personnel specialists one of whom knew mr. stone 's case <unk> and would help fill in any facts needed to give the court the full picture 
 over a cup of coffee mr. stone told his story 
 he talked about N minutes 
 when he was through the court members asked many questions then the chairman said they would like to hear his manager 's side and talk to witnesses 
 the chairman promised mr. stone a decision within two weeks 
 bob stone is a <unk> name but the incident described is real 
 it happened at northrop corp. in los angeles 
 the court is called the management appeals committee or just mac and it is likely to hear a couple of dozen cases a year 
 alter some details of this example and it could be taking place today at federal express in memphis the defense and <unk> systems divisions of honeywell in minneapolis a general electric plant in columbia md. or a number of other companies 
 these firms are <unk> in a significant new trend in the corporate world the rise of what i call corporate due process 
 although corporate due process is practiced today in few companies perhaps N to N it is one of the fastest developing trends in industry 
 in the coming decade a majority of <unk> companies are likely to adopt it 
 corporate due process appeals to management for a variety of reasons 
 it reduces lawsuits from <unk> employees and <unk> with all that means for reduced legal costs and better public relations 
 it helps to keep out unions 
 it increases employee commitment to the company with all that means for efficiency and quality control 
 what must your management team do to establish corporate due process 
 here are four key steps 
 N make sure you have a strong personnel department 
 it must be able to handle most of the complaints that can not be solved in the <unk> by managers and their subordinates else the company court or <unk> will be <unk> with cases 
 at polaroid the personnel policy planning committee may hear only about N cases a year the rest of the many hundreds of complaints are resolved at earlier stages 
 at <unk> the system board of adjustment <unk> N to N cases a year only a fraction of the complaints brought to personnel specialists 
 at citicorp the problem review board may hear only N or so cases because of personnel 's <unk> in <unk> 
 in a typical year up to N N of the work force goes to personnel specialists with complaints of unfair treatment 
 in a large company that means many hundreds of complaints for personnel to handle 
 N formally or <unk> train all your managers and supervisors in the company 's <unk> approach 
 see that they know company personnel policy <unk> and <unk> for it is the law governing company courts and <unk> 
 coach them in handling complaints so that they can resolve problems immediately 
 in case managers and personnel specialists are unsuccessful and subordinates take their complaints to a company court or <unk> teach managers to accept <unk> as a fact of business life for in a good <unk> system they are bound to happen 
 in the N companies i studied reversal rates range on the average from N N to N N 
 N decide whether you want a panel system or a single <unk> 
 a panel system like that in the bob stone example enjoys such advantages as high credibility and for the <unk> mutual support 
 an <unk> system that is an investigator who acts first as a <unk> and then switches hats and <unk> the facts has such advantages as speed flexibility and maximum privacy 
 international business machines and bank of america are among the companies using the <unk> approach 
 N make your <unk> system visible 
 it wo n't do any good for anybody unless employees know about it 
 most <unk> hesitate to go all out in advertising their <unk> systems for fear of encouraging <unk> and <unk> <unk> to file complaints 
 on the other hand they make sure at a minimum that their systems are described in their employee <unk> and talked up by personnel specialists 
 <unk> <unk> goes further and sometimes features its <unk> procedure in <unk> tv programs 
 naturally one of the best ways to guarantee <unk> for your <unk> system is for top management to support it 
 at ibm the company 's open door system is sometimes the subject of <unk> from the chief executive 
 federal express goes further in this respect than any company i know of with both frederick smith and james <unk> chief executive and chief operating officer respectively sitting in on the appeals board almost every tuesday to decide cases

 the u.s. is required to notify foreign <unk> if it knows of coup plans likely to endanger their lives government officials said 
 the notification policy was part of a set of guidelines on handling coups outlined in a secret N exchange of letters between the reagan administration and the senate intelligence committee 
 the existence of the guidelines has become known since president bush disclosed them privately to seven republican senators at a white house meeting last monday 
 officials familiar with the meeting said mr. bush cited the policy as an example of the sort of congressional requirements the administration contends contribute to the failure of such covert actions as this month 's <unk> effort to oust panamanian dictator manuel noriega 
 according to the officials mr. bush even read to the senators <unk> from a highly classified letter from the committee to the white house discussing the guidelines 
 they said the president conceded the notification requirement did n't affect his decision to lend only minor support to this month 's panama coup effort 
 no notification was ever considered officials said apparently because the u.s. did n't think the coup <unk> intended to kill mr. noriega but merely sought to <unk> him 
 what 's more both administration and congressional officials hint that the notification requirement is likely to be dropped from the guidelines on coup attempts that are being <unk> by the panel and the white house 
 the <unk> was launched at a meeting between mr. bush and intelligence committee leaders oct. N a few days before the meeting at which the president complained about the rules 
 however the disclosure of the guidelines first reported last night by nbc news is already being interpreted on capitol hill as an unfair effort to pressure congress 
 it has reopened the bitter <unk> between the white house and congress over who is responsible for the failure to oust mr. noriega and more broadly for difficulties in carrying out covert activities abroad 
 a statement issued by the office of the committee chairman sen. david boren d. okla. charged that the disclosure is part of a continuing effort to shift the criticism for the failure of the recent coup attempt in panama 
 the statement added someone has <unk> chosen to <unk> <unk> portions of highly classified <unk> between the two branches of government 
 not only does this come close to a violation of law it violates the trust we have all worked to develop 
 sen. boren said it 's time to stop <unk> and work together to develop a clear and appropriate policy to help the country in the future 
 i 've invited the president to send his suggestions to the committee 
 republican sen. william cohen of maine the panel 's vice chairman said of the disclosure that a text torn out of context is a <unk> and it is unfair for those in the white house who are <unk> to present the evidence in a selective fashion 
 sen. boren said the committee could n't defend itself by making the documents public because that would violate <unk> rules 
 but the chairman and other committee members stressed that the notification guideline was n't imposed on the white house by a <unk> congress 
 instead both congressional and administration officials agreed it grew out of talks about <unk> in panama that were initiated by the administration in july N and stretched into last october 
 the guideline was n't a law but a joint interpretation of how the u.s. might operate during foreign coups in light of the longstanding presidential order banning a u.s. role in assassinations 
 in fact yesterday the administration and congress were still <unk> on what had been agreed to 
 one administration official said notification was required even if the u.s. gets wind of somebody else 's coup plans that seem likely to endanger a dictator 's life 
 but a congressional source close to the panel said the rule only covered coup plans directly involving the u.s. 
 although the notification guideline was n't carried out in this month 's coup attempt some administration officials argue that it may have led to <unk> and uncertainty on the part of u.s. intelligence and military <unk> in panama 
 one senior administration official called the guideline <unk> and said it could make u.s. <unk> reluctant to even listen to coup plans for fear they may get into legal trouble 
 the issue came to a head last year officials recalled partly because the reagan administration had sought unsuccessfully to win committee approval of funding for new panama coup efforts 
 in addition both administration and congressional officials said the need for guidelines on coups and assassinations was partly spurred by a white house desire to avoid nasty overseas surprises during the election campaign 
 though the assassination ban is a white house order that congress never voted on the intelligence committees can exercise influence over its interpretation 
 last week central intelligence agency director william webster publicly called on congress to provide new <unk> of the assassination order that would permit the u.s. more freedom to act in coups 
 the administration has reacted to criticism that it <unk> the latest coup attempt by seeking to blame congress for restrictions the white house said have hampered its freedom of action 
 however last week mr. webster 's two top cia deputies said congressional curbs had n't hampered the spy agency 's role in the coup attempt in panama 
 nevertheless the administration 's criticisms appeared to have made some <unk> with sens. boren and cohen after their oct. N meeting with the president 
 the three men agreed to rewrite the guidelines without changing the basic assassination ban to clear up any <unk> that may have hampered u.s. encouragement of coups against <unk> leaders 
 the new argument over the notification guideline however could sour any atmosphere of cooperation that existed

 all these consultants kept coming around telling us we should concentrate on high technology electronics or biotechnology and get out of mature basic industries mr. andersson recalls 
 yet under its 45-year-old president trelleborg moved aggressively into those <unk> base industries first strengthening its existing rubber and plastics division later adding mining as well as building and construction materials 
 it was a <unk> move for a <unk> executive fired after only two months as president of his previous company 
 but going against the grain has never bothered mr. andersson 
 <unk> his trademark white <unk> during a recent interview the <unk> <unk> <unk> it turned out to be lucky for us 
 if the whole market thinks what you 're doing is crazy you do n't have much competition 
 mr. andersson is anxious to strengthen trelleborg 's balance sheet 
 <unk> he did n't waste much time getting started 
 on tuesday trelleborg 's directors announced plans to spin off two big divisions minerals processing and building and distribution as separately quoted companies on stockholm 's stock exchange 
 at current market prices the <unk> public offerings to be completed next year would add an estimated N billion swedish kronor $ N million to trelleborg 's <unk> analysts say 
 the board had also been expected to approve a <unk> billion international offering of new trelleborg shares 
 but that share issue intended to make trelleborg better known among international investors was postponed until market conditions stabilize people familiar with the situation say 
 trelleborg 's internationally traded <unk> series stock plunged <unk> $ N to <unk> $ N in volatile trading monday in stockholm 
 tuesday the shares regained <unk> closing at <unk> 
 mr. andersson says he is confident that taking parts of the company public will help <unk> the conglomerate <unk> that has held down trelleborg 's share price 
 trelleborg plans to remain the dominant shareholder with stakes of slightly less than N N of both units 
 the spinoff should solve a problem for the parent 
 a family foundation set up by late founder henry <unk> controls N N of trelleborg 's voting shares outstanding 
 but the foundation <unk> require the entire trelleborg stake to be sold in the open market if control drops below N N 
 that possibility had <unk> closer as repeated new share offerings to finance trelleborg 's rapid growth steadily diluted the foundation 's holding 
 that growth is the result of mr. andersson 's shopping spree during which he has bought and sold more than N companies during the past five years 
 most of the new additions were barely profitable if not outright loss makers 
 applying <unk> gained during earlier <unk> at <unk> maker ab <unk> mr. andersson and a handful of loyal <unk> aggressively stripped away dead wood and got quick results 
 the treatment turned trelleborg into one of <unk> 's biggest and fastest-growing industrial concerns 
 between N and N sales <unk> more than N times and pretax profit surged almost <unk> 
 many analysts expect mr. andersson who owns N N of the company to be named trelleborg 's new chairman when ernst <unk> steps down next year 
 but the promotion is n't likely to alter a management style mr. andersson describes as being the driving force leading the troops not managing by sitting back with a <unk> waiting for people to bring me ideas 
 last month in his <unk> move yet mr. andersson and trelleborg joined forces with canada 's noranda inc. in a joint $ N billion hostile takeover of another big canadian mining concern falconbridge ltd 
 industry analysts suggest that the <unk> of falconbridge could vault trelleborg from a regional <unk> success story to a <unk> mining concern 
 trelleborg is n't in the same league yet as mining giants such as <unk> corp. or <unk> corp. says mike <unk> a mining analyst at james capel & co. london 
 but we certainly like what we 've seen so far 
 but trelleborg still must clear some tough hurdles 
 mr. andersson acknowledges that the company 's mining division will be busy for a while <unk> its recent expansion 
 booming metals prices have fueled trelleborg 's recent profit surge raising mining 's share of pretax profit to N N this year from a big loss two years earlier 
 but analysts caution an expected fall in metal prices next year could slow profit growth 
 mining is likely to remain trelleborg 's main business 
 analysts say its chances of success will likely <unk> on how well trelleborg manages to cooperate with noranda in the falconbridge venture 
 noranda and trelleborg each came close to winning falconbridge alone before the successful joint bid 
 some analysts say noranda would prefer to break up falconbridge and that the <unk> relatively <unk> in international mining operations could have problems holding their own with a much bigger partner like noranda operating on its home turf 
 mr. andersson insists that trelleborg and noranda have n't discussed a falconbridge <unk> 
 falconbridge he says will continue operating in its current form 
 we 'd be reluctant to accept N ownership in a manufacturing company 
 but such partnerships are common in mining where there are n't problems or conflict of interest or risk of cheating by a partner trelleborg 's president says 
 perhaps more important both companies share mr. andersson 's belief in the coming renaissance of base industries 
 if the 1980s were a decade of consumption the <unk> will be the investment decade mr. andersson says 
 the whole of europe and the industrialized world is suffering from a breakdown in infrastructure investment he says 
 that 's beginning to change 
 and investment is the key word for base metals and most other businesses trelleborg is in

 potential buyers mostly foreign companies are reluctant to take a <unk> stake in a company that by the government 's own <unk> needs some $ N million in new capital for rehabilitation

 the <unk> states institute is glad to see such a high official as mexico 's undersecretary of finance view his country 's reforms in the context of a larger world-wide process of <unk> change toward free-market economics especially in the <unk> countries 
 having said that we must caution against an apparent tendency to <unk> the case 
 it is not quite true for example that the mexican government has privatized <unk> de <unk> as mr. ortiz claims 
 in the same sentence he <unk> himself when he reports that the government still retains N N of the total equity of the airline 
 how can a company be considered privatized if the state is so heavily represented in it 
 true the mexican government has granted control over the airline to a new private consortium but its <unk> to take back what it gives is too well known to permit one to be <unk> 
 <unk> too mr. ortiz resorts to the familiar numbers game when he boasts that fewer than N state enterprises currently remain in the public sector down from the N public entities that existed in N 
 but the enterprises still in state hands include the biggest and most economically powerful ones in mexico indeed they virtually constitute the economic infrastructure 
 i refer essentially to petroleum electric power banking and newsprint 
 those enterprises however are not going to be privatized 
 they are officially considered strategic and their privatization is prohibited by the mexican constitution 
 in language that <unk> the issue mr. ortiz writes the divestiture of <unk> and <unk> public enterprises is an essential element of president carlos salinas 's plan to modernize mexico 's economy 
 yet clearly modernization must <unk> its key industries before it can be said to have caught the privatization <unk> 
 the bottom line however is not economic but political reform 
 a long succession of mexican presidents <unk> <unk> whatever industry they took a fancy to without having to answer to the public 
 to guarantee that <unk> de <unk> and other companies will really be privatized mexico needs a <unk> political system that will ensure democracy and hence accountability

 a labor-management group is preparing a revised buy-out bid for united airlines parent ual corp. that would transfer majority ownership to employees while leaving some stock in public hands according to people familiar with the group 
 the group has been discussing a proposal valued in a range of $ N to $ N a share or $ N billion to $ N billion 
 but to avoid the risk of rejection the group does n't plan to submit the plan formally at a ual board meeting today 
 instead the group is raising the proposal <unk> to try to test the board 's reaction 
 people familiar with the company say the board is n't likely to give quick approval to any offer substantially below the $ 300-a-share $ N billion buy-out bid that collapsed last week after banks would n't raise needed loans and after a key partner british airways plc dropped out 
 in composite trading friday on the new york stock exchange ual closed at $ N a share down $ N 
 but the pilots union which has been pushing for a takeover since N appears to be pressing ahead with the revised bid to avoid further loss of momentum even though it has n't found a partner to replace british air 
 although the bidding group has n't had time to develop its latest idea fully or to discuss it with banks it believes bank financing could be obtained 
 after the collapse of the last effort the group does n't plan to make any formal proposal without <unk> commitments from banks covering the entire amount to be borrowed 
 under the type of transaction being discussed the <unk> group would borrow several billion dollars from banks that could then be used to finance a cash payment to current holders 
 those current holders would also receive minority interests in the new company 
 for example the group could offer $ N a share in cash plus stock valued at $ N a share 
 ual currently has N million shares fully diluted 
 the new structure would be similar to a recapitalization in which holders get a special dividend yet retain a controlling ownership interest 
 the difference is that current holders would n't retain majority ownership or control 
 the failed takeover would have given ual employees N N voting control of the nation 's second-largest airline with management getting N N control and british air N N 
 it was n't clear how the ownership would <unk> up under the new plan but employees would keep more than N N 
 management 's total could be reduced and the public could get more than the N N control that had been earmarked for british air 
 one option the board is likely to consider today is some sort of <unk> period 
 although the pilots are expected to continue to pursue the bid ual chairman stephen wolf may be asked to withdraw from the buy-out effort at least temporarily and to return to running the company full time 
 the board could eventually come under some pressure to sell the company because its members can be ousted by a majority shareholder vote particularly since one-third of ual stock is held by takeover stock speculators who favor a sale 
 the labor-management buy-out group plans to keep its offer on the table in an apparent attempt to maintain its bargaining position with the board 
 however the only outsider who has emerged to lead such a shareholder vote los angeles investor marvin davis who triggered the buy-out with a $ N billion bid in early august is hanging back apparently to avoid being blamed for contributing to the deal 's collapse 
 three top advisers to mr. davis visited new york late last week at least in part to <unk> with executives at citicorp 
 mr. davis had paid $ N million for citicorp 's backing of his last bid 
 but citicorp has lost some credibility because it also led the unsuccessful effort to gain bank loans for the labor-management group 
 on friday british air issued a statement saying it does not intend to participate in any new deal for the acquisition of ual in the foreseeable future 
 however several people said that british air might yet <unk> the bidding group and that the carrier made the statement to answer questions from british regulators about how it plans to use proceeds of a securities offering previously earmarked for the ual buy-out 
 also late last week ual flight attendants agreed to participate with the pilots in <unk> a revised offer 
 but the machinists union whose opposition helped scuttle the first buy-out bid is likely to favor a recapitalization with a friendly <unk> investor 
 one advantage the buy-out group intends to press with the board is that pilots have agreed to make $ N million in annual cost concessions to help finance a bid 
 speculation has also <unk> that the ual executive most closely identified with the failure to gain bank financing chief financial officer john pope may come under pressure to resign 
 however people familiar with the buy-out group said mr. pope 's departure would weaken the airline 's management at a critical time 
 despite the buy-out group 's failure to obtain financing ual remains obligated to pay $ N million in investment banking and legal fees to the group 's advisers lazard <unk> & co. salomon brothers inc. and paul weiss <unk> <unk> & garrison

 in east germany where humor has long been the only way to express political criticism they 're not laughing about their new leader egon krenz 
 mr. krenz is such a <unk> figure that nobody has even come up with any good jokes about him 
 you have to have clear feelings about someone before you can make jokes says an east german mother of two who <unk> <unk> political <unk> with her friends 
 with krenz we just do n't know what to expect 
 mr. krenz does n't seem to be the <unk> <unk> many initially thought he was when the <unk> politburo member was selected last week to succeed erich honecker 
 but he does n't appear to be ready to make broad changes either 
 according to east germany 's <unk> news agency mr. krenz spoke to soviet leader mikhail gorbachev by telephone over the weekend and acknowledged east germany could learn from moscow 's glasnost policies 
 already last week mr. krenz started <unk> east germany 's heavily <unk> and <unk> boring news media 
 on thursday a day after he took office east german television broke into regular programming to launch a talk show in which viewers call in questions for a panel of officials to answer 
 the regular <unk> news program and daily newspapers are also getting a visible injection of <unk> glasnost 
 it was quite a shock says a <unk> east german <unk> 
 for the first time in my life i was n't sure whether i was listening to our news or west german television 
 other changes including easing restrictions on travel for east germans are expected 
 but whether such moves can win back the confidence of east germans who have taken to the streets by the thousands in recent weeks to demand democratic changes depends largely on whether they feel they can trust mr. krenz 
 and that 's a problem 
 mr. krenz is not only closely identified with his <unk> mr. honecker but also blamed for ordering violent police action against protesters this month and for <unk> china for sending tanks against student demonstrators 
 i hope he grows with the job says <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> in east berlin 
 the most important thing is that he have a chance 
 although mr. krenz is dedicated to east germany 's conservative <unk> of communism there is much about his style that sets him apart from his party <unk> 
 unlike mr. honecker who <unk> to <unk> people about socialist values mr. krenz enjoys asking questions 
 indeed one of his first actions as leader was to visit a <unk> machine factory on the <unk> of berlin and <unk> among the workers a la gorbachev 
 he was later shown on television <unk> questions 
 at one point he asked a worker whether he thought east germans were <unk> the country because of restrictive travel policies 
 the worker 's <unk> <unk> it 's more than just travel 
 people have a sense the government is ignoring the real problems in our society 
 the exchange was all the more remarkable in that authorities released television <unk> to western news agencies 
 this same tendency toward openness impressed a group of visiting u.s. congressmen this spring 
 rather than trying to <unk> us says one congressional aide who attended the <unk> meeting mr. krenz wanted to listen 
 rep. <unk> <unk> d. ala. one of the members of the delegation says he was particularly impressed by mr. krenz 's ready admission that east germany needed to change 
 he 's a very tough man but one who 's also open to arguments adds an aide to west german chancellor helmut kohl 
 but there 's another side to mr. krenz 
 born in a <unk> town in an area which is now part of poland he has dedicated his life to the party <unk> 
 he moved quickly through the ranks with the help of his <unk> mr. honecker and emerged as the heir apparent 
 barbara <unk> an expert on east germany at radio free europe in <unk> says mr. krenz may project a smooth image but she doubts he 's a true <unk> 
 even if he is she adds he appears to have only limited room for maneuver within the communist party 's ruling politburo 
 against this background the new east german leader must move quickly to shore up his government 's standing 
 the sudden growth of the opposition movement together with the steady <unk> of citizens <unk> through poland and hungary has plunged the country into its <unk> political crisis since an <unk> workers ' <unk> in N 
 he does n't have any <unk> period says a western diplomat based in east berlin 
 but if he 's sharp and quick he has a chance 
 the diplomat adds that mr. krenz has several things going for him 
 the east german economy is strong compared with other east bloc nations 
 and his relative youth could help him project a more <unk> image <unk> with the perception of mr. honecker as an <unk> old man 
 for average east germans mr. krenz remains a <unk> 
 either he was n't being real in the past or he is n't being real right now says a <unk> east german doctor 
 either way i have a problem with how quickly he 's changed 
 the doctor was among dozens of people <unk> through east berlin 's <unk> church saturday morning 
 the walls of the church are covered with <unk> news <unk> and <unk> notes associated with the country 's political opposition 
 i have to come here to read the walls says the doctor because it 's information i still ca n't get through the newspapers 
 meanwhile east germany 's growing openness may even allow the state-controlled news media to display a <unk> sense of humor 
 television last week carried a new report on east berlin 's main <unk> factory and the need to boost production 
 east germans remember a comment a few years ago by kurt <unk> the government 's top <unk> that just because a neighbor hangs new <unk> there 's no reason to change your own 
 his point was there is no reason for east germany to copy <unk> changes 
 it 's hard to know whether it was intended to be funny says the east berlin <unk> but everyone i know <unk> about it 
 the list of laboratories claiming to be producing <unk> amounts of heat from cold fusion experiments is slowly growing 
 but the experiments continue to be plagued by lack of firm evidence that the extra heat is coming from the <unk> of <unk> atoms 
 new experiments at some of the big national laboratories are still unable to find hints of nuclear fusion reactions leaving only the finding of tritium in a texas experiment to support university of utah <unk> ' claim of <unk> <unk> fusion at room temperatures 
 the latest developments in cold fusion research were presented in N reports delivered at the fall meeting here of the <unk> society the first scientific meeting in five months to hear formal reports on cold fusion experiments 
 the meeting offered stark evidence of a dramatic fall in scientific interest in cold fusion research 
 of the N <unk> registered for the society 's <unk> meeting fewer than N sat through the day and a half of cold fusion <unk> at week 's end 
 this was in contrast with the society 's meeting last may at the <unk> of the controversy when more than N scientists along with scores of reporters and tv crews crowded into a los angeles hotel <unk> for a tumultuous special night session on the subject 
 neither of the two <unk> whose utah experiments triggered the cold fusion <unk> martin fleischmann and b. stanley pons were at the meeting 
 but some members of an ad <unk> expert committee set up by the department of energy to evaluate the cold fusion research were in the audience 
 the committee is to recommend at the end of the month whether <unk> should support cold fusion research 
 most of the two dozen scientists taking the <unk> reported results with new more sophisticated variations of the seemingly simple <unk> experiments described last march by messrs. fleischmann and pons 
 the experiments involve <unk> a thin rod of palladium metal with a wire of platinum and plunging the two <unk> into heavy water in which the <unk> atoms are a <unk> heavy form known as <unk> 
 when an electric current is applied to the palladium and platinum <unk> the heavy water did begin to break up or <unk> 
 ordinarily the <unk> or breakup of the water would consume almost all of the electrical energy 
 but messrs. fleischmann and pons said their experiments also produced large amounts of heat 
 the heat energy plus the energy consumed by the breakup of the water <unk> added to far more energy coming out of the <unk> than electrical energy going in they reported 
 because they also detected tritium and indications of nuclear radiation they asserted that the excess heat energy must be coming from energy released by the nuclear fusion of <unk> atoms inside the palladium rod 
 as of last weekend a dozen labs also have reported measuring excess heat from similar <unk> experiments although amounts of such heat vary widely 
 one of the seven reports presented here of excess heat production was given by richard a. <unk> professor of chemical engineering at the university of minnesota 
 mr. <unk> said his skepticism of the utah claims was initially confirmed when his first experiments last spring failed to produce results 
 but he then borrowed a palladium rod from <unk> at texas <unk> who said they were getting excess heat 
 the results were <unk> he said 
 on the fourth run with the borrowed rod the experiment began producing excess heat 
 the experiment was stopped briefly to change an instrument 
 when it was <unk> heat output really took off and produced excess heat for several hours before dying down he said 
 typical of other experiments mr. <unk> said his experiment was very <unk> 
 it would go along doing nothing but <unk> the heavy water and then at totally <unk> times it would begin producing excess heat for as long as N or N hours before <unk> down 
 the excess heat was N N to N N more than the energy involved in the <unk> of water 
 mr. <unk> said the heat bursts were too large and too long to be explained by the sudden release of energy that might have slowly accumulated during the experiments ' <unk> times as some scientists have suggested 
 there is a reality to the excess energy he said 
 other scientists said they also were getting sporadic bursts of excess heat lasting several hours at a time 
 the bursts often occur they said after they <unk> the experiments by raising or lowering the amount of electric current being applied or switching the current off and on 
 one <unk> privately suggested this hinted that some <unk> chemical reactions might be producing the heat 
 one reason questions <unk> the heat experiments is that they involve unusually <unk> measurements 
 typically the input energy ranges from a third of a <unk> to one <unk> and the excess energy is measured in <unk> of a <unk> 
 one exception is a continuing experiment at stanford university where as much as N watts of energy are being put into the <unk> cells 
 a cell filled with heavy water is producing N to N watts more heat than an identical <unk> cell filled with ordinary water next to it reported <unk> m. <unk> an associate of materials scientist robert a. <unk> head of the stanford experimental team 
 one of the few hints the excess heat might be produced by fusion came from brief remarks by <unk> john <unk> of texas <unk> university 
 mr. <unk> previously reported getting bursts of excess heat and of <unk> increasing amounts of tritium forming in the heavy water 
 he said that within the past few days he 's gotten evidence that there is a weak <unk> between the time the heat bursts occur and the production of tritium 
 there is n't any way to <unk> measure the amount of tritium in the heavy water so it 's been difficult to tell whether the tritium formation is related to the heat bursts or some other phenomenon 
 increasingly careful attempts to measure neutrons which would be strong evidence of fusion reactions continue to be negative 
 messrs. fleischmann and pons initially reported indirect evidence of neutrons being produced in their experiment but later conceded the measurements were questionable 
 researchers at <unk> national laboratories in <unk> n.m. reported they went so far as to take a cold fusion experiment and three <unk> detectors into a tunnel under N feet of <unk> to shield the detectors from <unk> <unk> 
 a number of times they detected neutrons in one sometimes two of the three detectors but only once during N hours of the experiment did they detect a <unk> burst in all three detectors and they think that was a <unk> event 
 <unk> <unk> of los <unk> national laboratory said researchers there detected a burst of neutrons from an early cold fusion experiment last april but decided not to announce it until they could confirm it 
 in subsequent experiments one of two <unk> detectors occasionally indicated a burst of neutrons but <unk> bursts were never recorded in both detectors at the same time 
 they concluded the indications of neutrons stemmed from <unk> in the detectors rather than from the cold fusion experiment 
 at the lawrence berkeley laboratory in california new experiments indicated that the <unk> added to the heavy water so it will conduct a current can produce previously <unk> electrical effects on the surface of the palladium rod which messrs. fleischmann and pons might have <unk> reported philip ross from the california laboratory 
 dow jones & co. announced wall street journal advertising rates for N 
 the rates which take effect jan. N include a N N increase for national edition advertising 
 the journal also will offer expanded volume and frequency discounts 
 the increase for national edition advertising is less than the inflation rate and compares with a N N increase in N 
 newsprint and <unk> prices this year have not gone up said peter r. <unk> president of dow jones 
 we have invested in improved editorial quality and expanded our quality audience without substantially increasing our costs 
 fundamental fairness and a sense of responsibility lead us to share operating <unk> with our customers 
 advertising rates for the eastern midwest western and southwest editions will increase an average N N and rates for <unk> advertising editions will increase N N 
 rates for the wall street journal reports will remain unchanged 
 a one-time <unk> <unk> <unk> in the wall street journal national edition will cost $ N 
 advertising rates for the wall street <unk> published in brussels and printed in the netherlands and switzerland will increase N N 
 rates for the asian wall street journal published and printed in hong kong and also printed in singapore and tokyo will rise N N 
 rates for the asian wall street journal weekly published in new york for north american readers will rise N N 
 dow jones also publishes barron 's magazine other <unk> and community newspapers and operates electronic business information services 
 it owns N N of telerate inc. a leading supplier of computerized financial information on global markets 
 reflecting the impact of lower semiconductor prices and cuts in defense spending texas instruments inc. said third-quarter net income fell N N and sales dropped slightly from a year earlier 
 net fell to $ N million or N cents a common share from $ N million or $ N a share a year ago 
 sales fell N N to $ N billion from $ N billion 
 for the nine months the electronics and defense concern had net of $ N million or $ N a share down N N from $ N million or $ N a share in the year-ago period 
 sales were $ N billion up N N from $ N billion 
 jerry <unk> chairman president and chief executive officer said sluggish <unk> sales reduced demand for semiconductors 
 that coupled with lower semiconductor prices and higher <unk> expense contributed to the decline in sales and profit 
 in addition cost increases related to fixed-price defense contracts and a $ N million charge to reduce the work force of texas instruments ' <unk> division also reduced net 
 however the quarter results included $ N million in royalty income from patent licenses up from $ N million in the year-earlier period 
 the nine months include $ N million of royalty income up from $ N million last year 
 mr. <unk> was n't optimistic about the short-term outlook <unk> that further <unk> reductions may be needed 
 we expect near-term <unk> in the electronics market he said and we will take ongoing <unk> actions as necessary to keep operations aligned with demand 
 further he said an internal reorganization to combine several divisions into the information technology group is expected to affect fourth-quarter results by an undisclosed amount 
 lynch corp. said its lynch telephone corp. subsidiary completed the acquisition of western new mexico telephone co. for $ N million plus assumption of $ N million of debt 
 western new mexico telephone silver city had net income of $ N million on revenue of about $ N million last year 
 it is an independent phone company with a service area of N square miles in southwest new mexico 
 it is also a partner in the <unk> cellular franchise covering most of western new mexico 
 the transaction represents lynch 's entry into the telephone business 
 the company which has interests in television trucking services and <unk> and <unk> equipment said it plans to make other acquisitions in the telephone industry 
 nelson <unk> hunt 's attempted corner on silver a decade ago is still <unk> the market in this metal 
 silver now trading around $ N an ounce surged to an <unk> peak of $ N an ounce in january N from around $ N in <unk> 
 mr. hunt 's attempt to squeeze the silver market N years ago is still indirectly to blame for today 's market depression says <unk> edgar managing director of <unk> <unk> ltd. london bullion brokers 
 while some N million ounces of silver once held by mr. hunt and middle eastern associates are n't hanging over the market anymore the price surge of N <unk> an expansion of mine production and scrap recovery and encouraged silver consumers to <unk> on silver use mr. edgar says 
 photographic developers for example bought equipment to recover silver from spent photographs <unk> and processing solutions 
 meanwhile the photographic industry which accounts for N N of silver consumption continues to look for <unk> 
 japanese and u.s. photographic firms are beginning to produce electronic cameras and <unk> that do n't require silver dealers say 
 silver 's history of volatility is also discouraging investors dealers say 
 even in the present uncertain investment climate investors are <unk> quality assets such as treasury bills and bonds to gold silver and platinum dealers say 
 although prices rallied briefly following the tumble on world stock markets earlier this month and the related decline of the dollar precious metals are out of favor for the moment because of high interest rates and a determination by industrial nations to curb inflation dealers say 
 silver however is in a deeper slump than are gold and platinum 
 some analysts contend that silver is cheap now that prices are <unk> at levels last seen in the mid-1970s 
 bargain <unk> believe that silver offers the best value <unk> precious metals says frederick r. demler analyst at drexel burnham lambert inc 
 a further decline in prices will lead to mine production cuts in the u.s. he says 
 scrap merchants are converting smaller quantities of metal into silver while low prices are discouraging exports from india and the soviet union 
 silver prices could also be boosted by strikes in leading producing nations peru and mexico mr. demler says 
 meanwhile total fabrication demand for silver has risen six years in a row he says 
 japanese demand grew by N N in the first half of this year and the nation plans an issue of a silver <unk> coin that will require N million ounces 
 compared with huge annual surpluses of more than N million ounces in the first half of the 1980s world silver supplies and consumption are now nearly in balance mr. demler says 
 despite <unk> rallies in the past few years improvements in the <unk> balance have n't managed to push silver prices into a higher range 
 there 's just too much silver around says tom butler an analyst at samuel <unk> & co. a london bullion house 
 a huge silver <unk> at exchanges refiners <unk> industries and government warehouses of at least N million ounces is the market <unk> says shearson lehman hutton inc. in a report 
 this year alone inventories at the commodity exchange of new york jumped by a staggering N million to N million ounces because of producer deliveries <unk> by <unk> and sales by <unk> investors says <unk> o'connell london-based precious metals analyst at shearson lehman hutton 
 silver production is also in an <unk> upward trend ms. o'connell says 
 moreover while asian and middle eastern investors <unk> gold and help <unk> its price silver does n't have the same <unk> dealers say 
 investors have gotten burned on silver so often that they are far more partial to gold says <unk> <unk> senior vice president at union bank of switzerland 
 yet if gold prices improve silver prices could rally sharply he says 
 however dealers caution that any increase would be $ N to $ N at most

 livestock and <unk> 
 analysts expect the prices of live cattle futures contracts to rise in trading today in the wake of a government quarterly census that found <unk> cattle on feedlots 
 after the close of trading friday the agriculture department reported that feedlots in the N biggest ranch states held N million cattle on oct. N down N N from that date a year earlier 
 most analysts had expected the government to report a N N decline 
 feedlots <unk> young cattle for <unk> so a decline signals a tightening supply of beef 
 the government reported that the number of young cattle placed on feedlots during the quarter dropped N N compared with the year-earlier quarter 
 many industry analysts had been projecting a N N decline in <unk> for the quarter 
 in the N quarter many farmers were forced to sell their cattle to <unk> operators because the drought <unk> out the <unk> on their <unk> 
 the number of cattle moving onto feedlots in the recent quarter was also lower because <unk> cattle is less profitable 
 a shortage of young cattle has made them more expensive for <unk> operators to buy 
 the agriculture department also said that the number of <unk> cattle <unk> in the quarter dropped by N N from the N quarter which was in line with projections by analysts 
 energy 
 friday 's <unk> price drop to $ N in the <unk> november contract for west texas intermediate crude may well set the tone for trading this week in petroleum futures on the new york mercantile exchange 
 most traders and analysts attributed the decline to technical factors associated with the contract 's going off the board 
 others said that the drop continued the downward correction that 's been due in the petroleum pits and that such a trend could well continue in the next several trading sessions 
 barring any <unk> news events trading in the days ahead should further test recent projections by oil economists and other market watchers that strong fourth-quarter demand will keep prices firm 
 copper 
 copper prices fell sharply friday afternoon 
 for example copper for december delivery settled N cents lower at $ N a pound 
 pressure came from several developments including the settlement of two long-term strikes 
 on friday one analyst said <unk> workers ratified a new labor agreement ending a three-month strike at the highland valley mine in british columbia 
 in mexico the analyst added employees at the cananea mine who have been out of work since late august when the mine was declared bankrupt by the government accepted a N N cut in the <unk> work force 
 the mine is expected to return to production in about a week 
 on friday selling dominated the afternoon curb session in london which takes place at noon edt 
 the premium of cash copper to the three-month forward offerings narrowed indicating weaker demand for cash copper 
 long-term support for the december contract was believed to be at $ N a pound 
 a technical analyst said there were a number of stop-loss orders under that level that were touched off when the contract 's price fell below it 
 that brought in considerable fund selling which continued until the close of trading 
 in general it was a bearish close said ben <unk> a copper trader at rudolph <unk> & co. a major commodities trading and brokerage firm 
 but whether this price break has implications for this week he said we will know more when the london metal exchange copper stock levels are released monday morning 
 another analyst said he expected <unk> inventories to be down by about N tons when the weekly report is issued 
 bernard savaiko senior commodities analyst at painewebber inc. said that when traders saw the market was n't reacting <unk> to the forecasts of lower <unk> stocks they perceived a bearish sign 
 he also noted that the japanese who had been buying at prices just above the $ N level apparently pulled back from the market on friday 
 mr. savaiko said he sees a possibility of the december contract dropping to $ N a pound 
 hewlett-packard co. will announce today a software program that allows computers in a network to speed up computing tasks by sending the tasks to each other 
 called task broker the program acts something like an <unk> among a group of computers <unk> together 
 if a machine has a big computing task task broker asks other computers in the network for bids on the job 
 it then <unk> which machine is free to do the task most quickly and sends the task to that machine 
 hewlett-packard claims that the software allows a network to run three times as many tasks as conventional networks and will run each task twice as fast 
 the new hewlett-packard program said analyst john <unk> at <unk> research inc. a <unk> research company is a key building block as people move to this new model of distributed processing 
 in today 's computer networks some machines often sit idle while others are <unk> 
 with the hewlett-packard program he said you get more bang for the buck you 've spent on computers 
 the program which will be shipped in january N runs on the unix operating system 
 hewlett-packard will charge $ N for a license covering N users 
 the program now works on all hewlett-packard and <unk> workstations and on computers made by <unk> computer inc. of <unk> conn 
 hewlett-packard said it will sell versions later next year that run on sun microsystems inc. and digital equipment corp. machines 
 the task broker <unk> from other programs that spread computing tasks around a network 
 a previously available program called network computing system developed by hewlett-packard 's <unk> division for instance takes a task and <unk> it up into parts <unk> up those parts to several computers in a network for simultaneous processing 
 but programs in individual computers must be revised in order to work with that system 
 applications wo n't have to be <unk> to work with task broker hewlett-packard said and the user of a computer wo n't be able to tell that another machine is doing the work 
 the task broker turns that network into as far as the user is concerned one giant computer said bill <unk> general manager of hewlett-packard 's workstation group 
 price wars between the fast-food giants are starting to <unk> the fast-food little guys the franchisees 
 when <unk> start fighting <unk> get killed says murray <unk> <unk> of national restaurants a new york franchisee for pizza hut roy rogers and other chains 
 as <unk> and pizza outlets <unk> one area after another franchisers are struggling desperately for market share slashing prices and stepping up costly promotions 
 the fight is putting a tight squeeze on profits of many threatening to drive the smallest ones out of business and <unk> relations between the national fast-food chains and their franchisees 
 the chains used to offer discounts during winter when business was slow but in the last year or so discounting has become a 12-month thing says donald <unk> president of <unk> group inc. a new york franchisee of grand metropolitan plc 's burger king chain 
 though <unk> 's sales are up slightly this year mr. <unk> says profits will be flat or lower 
 and bill <unk> a <unk> ariz. <unk> of mcdonald 's corp. who is chairman of the company 's national operators advisory board says some fast-food outlets could be in serious trouble based on the amount of discounting that seems to be going on 
 until recently the huge fast-food industry with sales of about $ N billion last year kept <unk> to a minimum 
 but early this year pepsico inc. 's <unk> bell unit and wendy 's international inc. slashed prices and stepped up promotions says john <unk> an analyst for wertheim schroder & co 
 that brought a chain reaction in the industry 
 the situation was further <unk> early this month when mcdonald 's set plans to heat up the discounting by offering coupons 
 it also decided to go national with pizza which it has been <unk> 
 now <unk> deals on pizza are common so are <unk> <unk> on <unk> normally priced twice as high 
 the discounting say fast-food operators occurs on a scale and with a frequency they have n't seen before 
 the result is that some franchisees are running hard just to stay even laying off middle managers and working harder to make less 
 joe mack a district manager for <unk> enterprises inc. a burger king operator in omaha neb. says discounting is so <unk> that we have to serve N N to N N more customers to keep sales level 
 it 's almost as if you 're doing extra work to give away the food he says 
 alan <unk> president of <unk> 's inc. an operator of arby 's restaurants in omaha says all we 're doing is keeping the customers coming but we are n't increasing sales 
 with fast-food outlets on every corner he like many does n't think he has a choice in the price war our customers say that they wo n't go into a fast-food store unless they get a coupon 
 if the battle continues much longer many fast-food businesses will close or merge predicts vincent <unk> who owns a string of kentucky fried chicken stores in the midwest 
 the industry is overbuilt he says 
 fast-food franchisers have managed to squeeze in stores into every corner available 
 the national restaurant association says <unk> restaurant units in the u.s. rose N N to N between N and N the last year for which figures are available 
 with the market so crowded says a spokesman for wendy 's in columbus ohio if you 're doing well you 're doing well at someone else 's expense 
 simply put there is n't enough business for every store to grow 
 according to mr. <unk> inflation-adjusted <unk> sales at company-owned wendy 's units in the u.s. have trailed year-earlier levels throughout N except for august 
 mcdonald 's has also been running negative all year the analyst says 
 spokesmen for wendy 's and mcdonald 's criticized mr. <unk> 's calculations 
 jack greenberg executive vice president and chief financial officer of mcdonald 's says the company does n't <unk> much less disclose inflation-adjusted <unk> sales 
 he adds that short-term comparisons can be very misleading because of differences in timing of marketing programs from year to year 
 profit margins at company-owned mcdonald 's outlets in the u.s. are holding up quite <unk> says mr. greenberg 
 profits of franchisees have n't been higher since the mid-1970s he adds 
 but mr. greenberg 's <unk> outlook is n't matched by many fast-food industry observers 
 smaller chains and <unk> operators will be the first to fail many in the industry predict 
 big franchise groups can ride out the storm a lot longer says mr. <unk> the burger king operator in new york 
 the prolonged price pressures are driving a wedge between some franchisers and their franchisees 
 mr. <unk> the kentucky fried chicken franchisee notes that most franchise owners must absorb increases in expenses without any cut in the royalties or portion of sales that they must pay franchisers 
 franchisees ca n't be forced to go along with a <unk> 's discounting 
 but once a franchisee agrees to a promotional program the <unk> can demand full participation to the very end says <unk> <unk> a principal of <unk> & <unk> a chicago law firm with franchise industry clients 
 he says courts have held that antitrust considerations are <unk> in such cases by the need to protect consumers from deceptive marketing 
 in any case many franchisees in order to stay on good terms with franchisers routinely go along with promotions 
 says mr. <unk> of national restaurants if you resisted on prices maybe you would never get that telephone call about a new franchise

 <unk> jackson the retired baseball star has found another use for them 
 mr. jackson who won the <unk> mr. october for his world series <unk> is selling some of his canceled checks to <unk> collectors through a dealer for as much as $ N each 
 dealers say the <unk> trade in mr. jackson 's canceled checks is unusual 
 i do n't know of any living <unk> that 's ever done it says jack <unk> a dealer in <unk> iowa and a recognized expert in the field of baseball <unk> 
 an initial batch of mr. jackson 's checks was on sale at a <unk> show held in san francisco over labor day weekend 
 mr. jackson showed up at the affair to sign <unk> for a fee as well 
 for someone who has everything else <unk> 's jersey cap and cards his checks might be a nice addition says william <unk> owner of bill 's sports <unk> in denver who examined the checks at the san francisco card show 
 for years the canceled checks of a small number of well-known baseball players have been bought and sold 
 but these players were dead 
 maybe three years ago there were a lot of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> and <unk> back there were <unk> ruth checks says mr. <unk> 
 however the thought of a living player selling his checks <unk> some people the wrong way 
 maybe i 'm a little <unk> but i would n't sell them <unk> bob <unk> owner of <unk> 's sports cards in menlo park calif 
 who knows how much they 'll be worth N years from now 
 and mr. <unk> does n't believe they 're worth all that much now 
 i do n't think the checks are worth $ N apiece he says 
 why mr. jackson who could n't be reached for comment has made some of his checks available for sale is n't clear 
 he probably has n't done it for the cash 
 i would say he 's definitely not in need of money says <unk> <unk> an agent of mr. jackson 's based in new york 
 he has good investments 
 and mr. jackson probably has opened new checking accounts too 
 or at least he should 
 i assume those accounts are closed says mr. <unk> referring to the accounts of the canceled checks 
 i do n't think he 'd want to give out his current account numbers 
 usx corp. and its japanese partner kobe steel ltd. agreed to form a joint venture to build a new plant to produce hot-dipped galvanized sheet products mainly for the automotive market 
 terms were n't disclosed for the plant which will have annual capacity of N tons 
 the move by the nation 's largest steelmaker follows a string of earlier announcements by other major steel companies 
 bethlehem steel corp. ltv corp. and armco inc. all have plans to build additional lines for such coated <unk> steel 
 the surge in production analysts say raises questions about capacity <unk> demand 
 they note that most of the new plants will come on line in N when the current import trade restraint program ends which could result in more imports 
 there 's too much capacity contended charles bradford an analyst with merrill lynch capital markets 
 i do n't think there 's anyone not building one 
 he does add however that <unk> japanese car makers are boosting the levels of <unk> steel in their autos instead of relying heavily on imported steel 
 that trend could increase demand for hot-dipped galvanized sheet 
 the hot-dipped galvanized segment is one of the fastest-growing and most profitable segments of the steel market <unk> by all major integrated steelmakers wanting to maintain an edge over smaller minimills and <unk> mills those spun off to employees 
 indeed usx said it expects the market for coated sheet steel to reach N million tons annually by N compared with N million tons shipped in N 
 for the first eight months of N analysts say shipments of hot-dipped galvanized steel increased about N N from a year earlier while overall steel shipments were up only N N 
 usx and kobe steel hope to reach a definitive agreement establishing the N partnership by the end of the year with construction tentatively slated for the spring of N and production by N 
 usx already has six lines in existing plants producing hot-dipped galvanized steel but this marks the first so-called <unk> plant for such production 
 moreover it will boost by N N usx 's current hot-dipped capacity of N tons 
 the company said it does n't expect the new line 's capacity to <unk> affect the company 's existing hot-dipped <unk> lines 
 steelmakers have also been adding capacity of so-called <unk> steel which is another way to make coated <unk> steel 
 one of the advantages of the hot-dipped process is that it allows the steel to be covered with a <unk> <unk> of <unk> more quickly 
 once you make up your mind about an investment the rest is easy right 
 you just call your broker and say buy or sell 
 dream on 
 there are all sorts of ways to give buy and sell instructions to a broker and just as many ways to get burned if you do n't know what you 're doing 
 so here 's a <unk> of the most common types of market orders permitted by the stock and commodity exchanges 
 two things to keep in mind not all exchanges accept every type of order 
 and even when a specific order is acceptable to an exchange a brokerage firm can refuse to enter it for a customer 
 market order this is probably the most widely used order and the one most open to abuse by unscrupulous floor brokers since it imposes no price restrictions 
 with a market order an investor tells a broker to buy or sell at the market 
 it 's like saying get me in now or get me out now 
 for example if wheat is being offered at $ N and bid at $ N a market order to buy would be filled at the higher price and a market order to sell at the lower price 
 a recent indictment alleges that some floor brokers at the two largest chicago commodity exchanges used market orders to fill customers ' orders at unfavorable prices by arranging trades with fellow brokers 
 profits realized from these trades would then be shared by the conspiring brokers 
 limit order limit orders are used when investors want to restrict the amount they will receive or pay for an investment 
 investors do this by <unk> a minimum price at which the investment may be sold or the maximum price that may be paid for it 
 <unk> an investor wants to sell a stock but not for less than $ N 
 a limit order to sell could be entered at that price 
 one risk investors may regret the restriction if the stock reaches N and then falls 
 unless the market goes at least one <unk> the smallest price <unk> permitted beyond the limit price investors are n't assured of having their orders filled because there may not be sufficient trading volume to permit filling it at the specified price 
 stop order stop orders tell a floor broker to buy or sell an investment once the price reaches a certain level 
 once the price reaches that level a stop order turns into a market order and the order is filled at whatever price the broker can get 
 stop orders are sometimes called stop-loss orders because they are frequently used to protect profits or limit losses 
 while stop orders sound similar to limit orders there is a difference sell stops must be entered at a price below the current market price and buy stops above 
 in contrast sell limit orders must be placed above the market price and buy limit orders are placed below 
 the crash in october N and last friday 's sell-off painfully taught some investors exactly what stop orders will and wo n't do 
 an investor who may have placed a stop-loss order at $ N under a stock that was trading at $ N a share on the friday before the crash was stunned to discover that the order was filled at $ N when the stock opened at that price on monday 
 <unk> order <unk> orders turn into limit orders when an investment trades at the price specified in the order 
 unlike stop orders which are filled at the market price when the stop price is hit <unk> orders demand that the trades be made only at the specified price 
 if it ca n't be made at that price it does n't get filled 
 investors who wish to be out of a position without the risk of receiving a <unk> price from a market order may use this type of order to specify the price at which the order must be filled 
 but if the market moves quickly enough it may be impossible for the broker to carry out the order because the investment has passed the specified price 
 <unk> order <unk> orders are like stop orders in that they become market orders if a specified price is reached 
 however unlike a <unk> order a buy <unk> order is entered at a price below the current price while a sell <unk> order is entered at a price above it 
 as soon as the market trades at the specified price the floor broker will fill it at the best possible price 
 <unk> order the <unk> order is one of several associated with the timing of trades 
 it <unk> a broker to buy or sell an investment at the specified price or better 
 but if the investment ca n't be bought or sold immediately the order is automatically canceled 
 gregory <unk> who came in second in the stock division of the recently completed u.s. trading championship says he uses <unk> orders almost exclusively when trading options 
 i like to use them to feel out the market he says 
 if they do n't fill it immediately then i can start over at a new price or try again with the same price 
 <unk> order this is another timing order 
 it is a market order that allows floor brokers to take more time to buy or sell an investment if they think they can get a better price by waiting 
 <unk> orders which are also known as <unk> the tape orders are always done at the customer 's risk 
 <unk> order this is really two orders in one generally for the same security or commodity <unk> floor brokers to fill whichever order they can first and then cancel the other order 
 in a <unk> market it prevents an investor from getting stuck with having made two trades on the same security 
 <unk> order this type of order couples many of the orders described above with instructions that the order must be carried out at or by a certain time 
 on the close can be added to many types of orders 
 for example <unk> orders must be filled during the last few minutes of trading for the day at a price that is within the official closing range of prices as determined by the exchange 
 <unk> orders are stop orders that only become active during the closing minutes of trading 
 day orders expire at the end of the day on which they are entered <unk> orders have no expiration date 
 most brokers assume that all orders are day orders unless specified otherwise 
 on oct. N N some investors learned the consequences of entering <unk> limit orders and then <unk> about them 
 they found they had bought stock from limit orders that they might have entered weeks or months earlier and had forgotten to cancel 
 it is always the responsibility of investors to keep track of the orders they have placed 
 investors who change their mind about buying or selling after an order has been filled are usually stuck with the consequences 
 mr. <unk> writes on the options and commodities markets for the wall street journal 
 in <unk> up the risks of stock-market investments there 's probably no starting place better than beta 
 but investors better not ignore its limitations either 
 beta is a handy gauge that measures the volatility of a stock or stock mutual fund 
 for any given move in the overall market it suggests how <unk> that particular issue might rise or fall 
 beta figures are widely available and easy to interpret 
 the beta of the broad market typically defined as the standard & poor 's 500-stock index is always N 
 so a stock with a beta of N is half as volatile one at N is N N more volatile and so on 
 cautious investors should generally go with stocks that have low <unk> 
 go with <unk> stocks to get the biggest <unk> from a bet on a bull market 
 remember though that beta also has important limitations 
 beta is only part of the risk in a stock says william f. <unk> the stanford university <unk> professor who developed the measure 
 there is risk that is not associated with market moves and the beta does n't tell you the magnitude of that 
 in particular beta does n't measure the company and <unk> risk associated with an individual stock 
 that business risk is very significant for an investor with only a few stocks but it virtually disappears in a large and <unk> portfolio 
 beta is also a poor indicator of the risk in stock groups that march to their own <unk> 
 in particular the prices of gold and other <unk> stocks shoot up and down but the stocks tend to have low <unk> because their moves are not <unk> 
 concern that investors could <unk> such <unk> led the american association of individual investors to eliminate beta figures for <unk> funds in the N edition of its mutual-fund guide 
 our fear was people would look just at the beta of a gold fund and say here is an investment with very low risk says john <unk> director of research for the chicago-based group 
 in reality it 's very volatile but the movements are not because of market movements 
 ready to review the <unk> of your investment portfolio 
 first a pop <unk> 
 when you think of the words risk and investment what 's the specific <unk> that comes to mind 
 pencils down 
 if you 're like most people you said it 's a holding that goes completely sour maybe a bond that defaults or a stock whose value disappears in a bankruptcy proceeding 
 people tend to see risk primarily on that one <unk> says timothy <unk> national director of personal financial planning for accountants deloitte haskins & sells 
 but <unk> lies another aspect of investment risk the hazard of shaping your portfolio to avoid one or more types of risk and being <unk> by others 
 this is clearly not good news to all you people who sleep like <unk> every night <unk> by <unk> of your money sitting <unk> in six-month cds 
 risk wears many <unk> and investments that are low in one type of obvious risk can be <unk> high in other less obvious kinds 
 u.s. treasury bonds for example are <unk> when it comes to returning money at maturity 
 but their value as investments can be <unk> by inflation which <unk> the purchasing power of bonds ' <unk> interest payments 
 risk is also a function of time 
 when financial professionals measure risk <unk> they usually focus on the volatility of short-term returns 
 stocks are much riskier than treasury bills for example because the range in performance from the best years to the worst is much wider 
 that is usually measured by the standard deviation or divergence of annual results from the average return over time 
 but investors who are <unk> with short-term fluctuations may be paying too little attention to another big risk not generating enough money to meet long-term financial and <unk> goals 
 for instance some investors have sworn off stocks since the N market crash last friday 's debacle only reinforced those feelings 
 but the stock market despite some <unk> declines has far outperformed other securities over extended periods 
 by retreating to the apparent security of say money-market funds investors may not be earning enough investment return to pay for a comfortable retirement 
 that 's the biggest risk of all the risk of not meeting your objectives says steven b. <unk> a new york financial planner with seidman financial services 
 as a result financial advisers say they take several steps when evaluating the <unk> of clients ' portfolios 
 they estimate the return a person 's current portfolio is likely to generate over time along with a standard deviation that suggests how much the return will vary year by year 
 they try to figure out the long-term results the person needs to meet major goals 
 and they <unk> types of risk that are not easily <unk> 
 the portfolios of two hypothetical families one a couple at retirement age and another a <unk> couple at age N illustrate several types of risk that investors need to consider 
 for instance the insured municipal bonds that dominate the older couple 's portfolio were probably selected in large part for their low repayment risk 
 but they <unk> the holders to a lot of inflation risk and interest-rate risk 
 the younger couple 's <unk> involve more risk than a diversified stock portfolio because the bulk of the money is in a single issue 
 note that the younger couple 's portfolio has a higher expected annual return N N vs. N N as calculated by seidman financial services which is the <unk> affiliate of <unk> seidman 
 that largely reflects the heavy <unk> 
 but one price paid for the higher expected return is greater short-term volatility as reflected in the higher standard deviation that seidman estimates for the younger couple 's portfolio 
 here 's how to interpret a standard deviation figure take the expected return and add one standard deviation to it 
 then take the expected return and <unk> one standard deviation 
 in two of three years the actual result should fall within that range if all the assumptions were accurate 
 then add and <unk> two standard <unk> to get a wider range 
 there 's a N N probability any year 's result will fall in the range 
 of course the greater volatility of the younger couple 's portfolio does n't necessarily mean those investments are riskier in terms of meeting the holders ' long-term goals 
 indeed the older couple 's portfolio could actually be riskier in that sense if the expected return wo n't generate enough dollars to meet their spending plans 
 they may feel <unk> secure now because they are not heavily in the stock market says john h. <unk> a financial planner with <unk> armstrong <unk> inc. in washington 
 but they may pay a price N or N years in the future 
 ms. <unk> reports on personal finance from the wall street journal 's new york bureau 
 when it comes to investing trying to weigh risk and reward can seem like throwing <unk> <unk> investors do n't know the actual returns that securities will deliver or the ups and <unk> that will occur along the way 
 looking to the past can provide some clues 
 over several decades for instance investors who put up with the stock market 's gyrations earned returns far in excess of those on bonds and cash investments like treasury bills 
 but while history can suggest what is reasonable to expect there 's no guarantee that the past will repeat itself 
 for instance some analysts believe bond returns and volatility have moved permanently closer to those of the stock market 
 and returns on cash investments may continue to exceed inflation by a wider margin than they did over the long-term past

 a letter from senator john kerry <unk> us today for <unk> that he had <unk> on manuel noriega

 it meant to convey our hope that the senator and other members of the congressional left are <unk> their dislike of noriega to include other notorious central american drug <unk> 
 the sandinistas of nicaragua for example also are part of the <unk> <unk> <unk> 
 in his letter and on the basis of his losing vote tuesday against u.s. aid for the nicaraguan opposition senator kerry makes clear he has not made that intellectual leap 
 we were wrong 
 throughout the 1980s investors have been looking for creative alternatives to traditional <unk> of financial planning 
 capital has been <unk> and people want in 
 too often however small investors are left with the same <unk> solutions that appealed to previous generations of fiduciary strategists 
 now a startling new approach is available to building your financial portfolio without <unk> risk without extensive planning and without hurting your life style one bit 
 this is particularly good news for those who hate risk who are <unk> of doing extensive amounts of planning and who refuse to see their life styles hurt in any way 
 you know who you are 
 my revolutionary system is also useful for those who have tried <unk> forms of growing their currency cushion 
 like all americans seeking <unk> prosperity i do find it necessary to plunge certain funds into conservative monetary tools if only to <unk> my <unk> who believes in such things 
 so throughout the decade i have maintained my share of individual retirement accounts and cds and <unk> with stocks bonds and mutual funds as well as preserving my necessary position in the residential real-estate market 
 return on this fine portfolio has been modest when it has not been negative 
 figure N demonstrates the performance of those businesses i 've invested in during this <unk> decade see accompanying illustration wsj oct. N N 
 <unk> properties suffered a huge decline until i <unk> myself of all such stocks in N at which point the industry while not lighting up any christmas trees began a slow recovery 
 likewise mutual funds remained relatively flat until i made what was for me a serious investment 
 by N these properties were in a tailspin causing my broker at <unk> to remark that she 'd never seen anything like it 
 concerned for her state of mind i dropped them and the market instantly began its steady climb back to health 
 perhaps most dramatic was the performance of the metropolitan new york real-estate market which was booming until i entered it in late N at which time it posted the first negative compound annual growth rate in years 
 <unk> i cast around for a different way to plan my asset distribution and with hardly any heavy breathing the answer struck me i was doing it already 
 we 've all got money to spend some of it clearly disposable since we keep <unk> of it 
 bank it 
 not really 
 <unk> it away in long-term instruments 
 nonsense 
 daily living is the best possible investment 
 your priorities may be different but here in figure N is where i 've chosen to build for the future personal space automotive <unk> children 's toys <unk> equipment <unk> and <unk> and finally entertainment perhaps the best investment of all 
 all have paid off for me in double-digit annual growth and continue to provide significant potential 
 at least according to my calculations 
 personal space figure N has grown N N annually over the course of the decade a performance that would compare <unk> with an investment in say <unk> products for the <unk> of <unk> vehicles which my <unk> got into and sort of regrets to this day 
 the <unk> of expensive children 's toys that i have purchased <unk> at a host of <unk> brokerage firms figure N has increased <unk> in total asset value far beyond any personal investment except perhaps for my record collection whose worth i think it 's safe to say is <unk> 
 continued investment in my N <unk> has been part of my strategy figure N with present annual contributions now equaling more than N N of the car 's original value 
 according to my calculations these outlays should have brought the value of my sedan to more than $ N on the open market figure N where i plan to offer it shortly 
 expansion of my living space has produced an obvious need for maintenance and construction of suitable <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> to its suburban <unk> 
 i have thus committed sufficient personal <unk> to ensure that my grounds and <unk> will never be short of greens and flowers 
 my initial stake in this <unk> enterprise has grown tenfold according to my conservative calculations 
 at the same time my share in a wide variety of entertainment <unk> has given perhaps the most dramatic demonstration of the benefits of creative personal financial planning 
 over the course of the decade for instance my return on investment in the area of <unk> alone figures <unk> and <unk> has been most impressive showing <unk> annual expansion with given the way my associates play no sign of <unk> into the 1990s and beyond 
 with this personal strategy firmly in place i look forward to years of fine <unk> investments and increasing widespread leverage 
 my kids ' college education looms as perhaps the greatest future opportunity for spending although i 'll probably have to cash in their toy portfolio to take advantage of it 
 but with every step i take i 'm building wealth 
 you can too if you like me refuse to <unk> the bullet 
 so go out there and eat that debt 
 you 're right there in the mainstream of american business building value on the back of <unk> expenditures 
 henry kravis watch out 
 mr. schwartz is a business executive and writer in new york 
 when james schwartz was just a <unk> his father gave him a piece of career advice 
 he told me to choose an area where just by being <unk> i could be great recalls mr. schwartz now N 
 he tried management consulting traded in <unk> for a while and even managed professional <unk> 
 now he has settled into a career that fits the bill financial planning 
 it should be noted that mr. schwartz who operates out of <unk> colo. is a <unk> sort who likes to give his colleagues the <unk> 
 but in this case the <unk> has a very sharp point 
 though it 's probably safe to assume that the majority of financial planners are honest and even reasonably competent the fact remains that as one <unk> puts it anybody who can <unk> a mirror can call himself a financial planner 
 planners now influence the investment of several hundred billion dollars but in effect they operate in the dark 
 there is no effective regulation of planners no accepted standard for admission into their ranks a dog got into one trade group no way to assess their performance no way even to know how many of them there are estimates range from N to N 
 all anyone need do is hang up a <unk> and start planning 
 so it should come as no shock that the profession if that 's what it is has attracted a lot of people whose principal <unk> seem to be <unk> away or <unk> stealing their clients ' money 
 alarmed state and federal authorities are trying to devise ways to <unk> and regulate planners 
 industry groups and reputable planners who are members of them want comprehensive standards too they 're tired of seeing practitioners <unk> <unk> in the business press as <unk> than <unk> and <unk> than a <unk> of <unk> 
 but reform has n't taken hold yet 
 the industry is still pretty much in its wild west days says scott <unk> director of investor education for the north american securities administrators association 
 an <unk> limited survey by <unk> whose members are state <unk> regulators found that between N and N fraud and abuse by financial planners cost N investors $ N million 
 the <unk> ' gallery of planners involved includes some convicted <unk> a <unk> <unk> or two various businessmen who had planned their own previous ventures right into bankruptcy and one man who <unk> his wife 's <unk> 
 what 's more the losses they and the others caused are just what we are <unk> over says mr. <unk> adding that the majority of <unk> probably go <unk> 
 so do just about all the losses that could be attributed to the sheer <unk> of <unk> planners 
 nobody can estimate the toll but john <unk> a tampa fla. planner and head of one trade group the international association of registered financial planners thinks the danger to investors from <unk> is <unk> far greater than that from <unk> 
 his group like others wants minimum standards applied to all who call themselves financial planners 
 <unk> all this some people now think the best planner might be no planner at all 
 for most investors the benefits just are n't worth the risks says barbara roper who follows <unk> issues for the consumer federation of america a <unk> organization based in washington 
 she concedes that such a position is unfair to the thousands of <unk> and qualified people <unk> the trade but as a consumer advocate she feels <unk> to take it 
 she says her group used to give tips on <unk> planners check educational and experience credentials <unk> regulators and better business bureaus but found that even some people who took these steps were still getting <unk> off 
 the bad news however has n't been bad enough to kill the growing demand for financial planning 
 the tax reform act of N which eliminated many tax shelters <unk> by planners and the stock market crash the next year did cause a sharp slump in such demand and many planners had to make an <unk> exit from the business 
 but membership in the international association of financial planners iafp the industry 's biggest trade group is still nearly triple what it was in N and it 's believed that the ranks of planners who do n't belong to any group have soared as well 
 an estimated N million americans are now using financial planners and the pool of capital they influence is enormous 
 a survey of N of them conducted by the iafp in april showed that these practitioners alone had controlled or <unk> the investment of $ N billion of their clients ' money in the previous N months 
 the sheer number of planners makes the business extremely difficult if not impossible to regulate 
 even the minority of them who must register with the securities and exchange commission as investment advisers people who are in the business of counseling others on the buying and selling of securities specifically have been enough to <unk> the agency 's capacity 
 the sec has only about N staffers assigned to keep <unk> on investment advisers about the same as in N even though the number of advisers has tripled to about N over the past decade 
 currently a registered investment adviser can expect an sec audit only once every N years 
 a lot of bad things can happen in N years 
 it does n't take a rocket scientist to figure out our problem says <unk> <unk> director of the sec 's division of investment management 
 so the sec has proposed to congress that much of the job of oversight be turned over to an <unk> <unk> organization <unk> on the national association of securities dealers which operates in the brokerage business 
 such an organization could among other things set minimum standards for <unk> ethics and finances and punish those investment advisers who broke the rules 
 the proposal has set off a <unk> debate within an industry that was far from united to begin with 
 mr. schwartz the <unk> planner from <unk> colo. says that allowing the business to police itself would be like putting <unk> in charge of the blood bank 
 mr. <unk> the tampa planner who heads one trade group favors simply assessing the industry and giving the money to the sec to hire more staff 
 mr. <unk> 's views are not greeted with wild enthusiasm over at the iafp the major industry organization 
 when the iafp recently assembled other industry groups to discuss common standards that might be applied to planners mr. <unk> 's group was excluded 
 that may be because mr. <unk> <unk> at what he considered <unk> on his membership standards made by the rival group <unk> his dog <unk> as a member of the iafp 
 then he sent the <unk> 's picture with the certificate of membership it was made out to <unk> <unk> <unk> to every newspaper he could think of 
 the states have their own ideas about regulation and <unk> 
 <unk> the organization of state securities regulators is pushing for a model regulatory statute already adopted in eight states 
 it requires financial planners to register with states pass <unk> tests and reveal to customers any conflicts of interest 
 the most common conflict involves compensation 
 <unk> estimates that nearly N N of planners receive some or all of their income from sales commissions on securities insurance and other financial products they recommend 
 the issue is the planner putting his clients into the best investments or the ones that <unk> the biggest commissions 
 in N the new york attorney general 's office got an order from a state court in albany <unk> down first meridian corp. an albany <unk> firm that had invested $ N million on behalf of nearly N investors 
 in its notice of action the attorney general said the company had promised to put clients into balanced investment portfolios instead the attorney general alleged the company consistently <unk> <unk> customers into high-risk investments in paintings coins and florida <unk> 
 those investments paid big commissions to first meridian payments investors were never told about the attorney general alleged 
 investors were further assured that only those with a <unk> net worth would be accepted 
 in practice the attorney general alleged in an affidavit if an investor had access to cash the chances of being turned down by first meridian were about as probable as being rejected by the <unk> club 
 and the attorney general added first meridian 's president roger v. <unk> portrayed himself as a financial expert when his <unk> largely <unk> of a high-school <unk> work as a real-estate and insurance salesman and a <unk> as supervisor at a highway toll <unk> 
 first meridian and its officials are currently under investigation for possible criminal wrongdoing according to a spokeswoman for the attorney general 
 harry <unk> mr. <unk> 's attorney says his client denies any wrongdoing and adds that the attorney general 's <unk> about first meridian 's business practices are incorrect 
 as for mr. <unk> 's <unk> the <unk> attorneys for the state of new york decided mr. <unk> was n't qualified because he did n't have a harvard degree says mr. <unk> 
 civil suits against planners by clients seeking recovery of funds are increasingly common 
 two such actions both filed earlier this year in georgia state court in atlanta could be particularly embarrassing to the industry both name j. chandler peterson an atlanta financial planner who is a founder and past chairman of the iafp as defendant 
 one suit filed by more than three dozen investors charges that mr. peterson <unk> much of the $ N million put into a limited partnership that he operated and <unk> spending some of it to pay his own legal bills and to invest in other companies in which he had an interest 
 those companies in turn paid mr. peterson commissions and fees the suit alleges 
 the other suit was filed by two men in a dispute over $ N investments each says he made with mr. peterson as part of an effort to purchase the bank of <unk> in <unk> <unk> 
 one plaintiff a doctor testified in an affidavit that he also gave mr. peterson $ N to join a sort of investment club which essentially gave the physician the privilege of making additional investments with mr. peterson 
 in affidavits each plaintiff claims mr. peterson promised the bank purchase would be completed by the end of N or the money returned 
 mr. peterson took the plaintiffs ' and other investors ' money to a meeting of the bank 's directors 
 wearing a business suit and western-style hat and <unk> he opened up his <unk> and dumped $ N million in cash on a table in front of the directors says <unk> <unk> the bank 's president 
 he said he wanted to show the color of his money recalls mr. <unk> 
 bank officials however showed him the door and the sale never came off 
 according to the suit mr. peterson has yet to return the plaintiffs ' investment 
 they want it back 
 mr. peterson declines to comment on specific allegations in the two suits saying he prefers to save such responses for court 
 but he does say that all of his activities have been entirely proper 
 on the suit by the limited partners he says he is considering a <unk> suit against the plaintiffs 
 the suit he adds is almost in the nature of a <unk> by a handful of <unk> people 
 <unk> the suit over the bank bid mr. peterson says it is filled with <unk> language and half <unk> 
 he declines to go into <unk> 
 mr. peterson says the suits against him are less a measure of his work than they are a sign of the times in which people generally are more prone to sue 
 i do n't know anybody in the industry who has n't experienced litigation he says 
 mr. peterson also says he does n't consider himself a financial planner anymore 
 he now calls himself an investment banker 
 in many scams or alleged scams involving planners it 's plain that only a <unk> of common sense on the part of the investors would have kept them out of harm 's way 
 using it would n't a <unk> hesitate to pay tens of thousands of dollars just for a chance to invest <unk> planner 
 other cases go to show that an old saw still applies if it sounds too good to be true it probably is 
 certificates of deposit do n't pay N N a year for example but that did n't give <unk> to clients of one alabama planner 
 now they 're losers and he 's in jail in mobile county 
 cds yielding N N are even more <unk> especially when the issuing bank in the marshall islands is merely a mail drop watched over by a local <unk> operator but investors fell for that one too 
 and the colorado planner who promised to make some of his clients <unk> on investments of as <unk> as $ N 
 never mind 
 you already know the answer 
 mr. <unk> is a staff reporter in the wall street journal 's los angeles bureau

 welcome to that <unk> of <unk> known as newport beach 
 this city of more than N is known for <unk> <unk> and rich residents 
 it is also known as the fraud capital of the u.s. dubbed by investigators and the media as the <unk> de fraud 
 how does a community famous for its high living end up as a haven for <unk> 
 clearly the existence of the former <unk> the latter 
 the places <unk> for breeding <unk> like the miami neighborhood known as the <unk> mile and las vegas 's flashy strip of casinos invariably offer fast cars high <unk> glamorous women and lots of <unk> 
 you do n't hear much about unusual <unk> of fraud in green bay or <unk> 
 con men hate snow 
 newport beach fits the <unk> artists ' specifications perfectly 
 what more could a con man in search of the easy life ask for 
 nothing seems hard here 
 the <unk> are soft the waves <unk> gently and the palm trees <unk> <unk> 
 <unk> is <unk> 
 moreover <unk> is <unk> 
 the median price of homes is $ N more than N vessels fill what the chamber of commerce calls the nation 's largest <unk> harbor 
 <unk> cocaine and <unk> <unk> mr. <unk> 
 that 's what they 're after 
 the rich image of newport beach also helps lend the con artists ' operation an air of respectability 
 one reason they use newport beach is that it sounds <unk> than most addresses says david katz a u.s. attorney who until recently headed a <unk> southern california fraud task force 
 newport beach is known in <unk> island for having a lot of rich people 
 no wonder all kinds of big-time scams have <unk> here from phony <unk> <unk> sales to <unk> car dealers to <unk> <unk> traders 
 but above all this is the national headquarters for <unk> operators those <unk> <unk> salesmen who use the telephone to extract money from the <unk> and the greedy and then <unk> 
 because only a fraction of them are ever prosecuted nobody really knows how much money <unk> <unk> operators really harvest 
 i 've heard that there is $ N billion taken in nationwide by boiler rooms every year mr. <unk> says 
 if that 's true orange county has to be at least N N of that 
 and most of the truly big scams in orange county seem to <unk> in newport beach or one of the other <unk> communities that <unk> this <unk> city that <unk> around a point of land on the california coast south of los angeles 
 in fact sophisticated <unk> <unk> scams are known <unk> among law-enforcement types as newport beach operations 
 that contrasts with the <unk> sales of things such as <unk> sets and office supplies that are known as hollywood scams 
 newport beach <unk> concentrate on precious metals and <unk> deals that typically cost thousands of dollars a shot 
 the investors range from elderly <unk> to affluent professionals 
 in one <unk> recent example of a newport beach boiler room prospective investors in capital trust inc. were allegedly told that their investment in precious metals was insured against losses caused by employees due to dishonesty destruction or disappearance according to an indictment handed up by a federal grand jury in los angeles last month 
 thus <unk> <unk> investors sent $ N million to the newport beach company most of which was diverted to unauthorized uses the indictment charges 
 douglas jones an attorney representing richard o. kelly sr. the chairman and president of capital trust says his client denies that there was any attempt to <unk> investors 
 there were some business deals that went bad mr. jones says but no intent to <unk> 
 newport beach operations differ from the hollywood boiler rooms in style as well as in dollars 
 traditionally boiler rooms operate on the cheap since few if any customers ever visit their offices 
 indeed the name <unk> from the tendency among <unk> <unk> to rent cheap <unk> space near the boiler room 
 but says mr. katz the u.s. attorney the interesting thing about newport beach operations is that they give themselves the <unk> of beautiful offices with <unk> <unk> 
 when we go there it 's quite different from these hollywood places where the <unk> are spread out on the table and the people are picking their <unk> 
 the newport beach operators also tend to <unk> themselves privately 
 investigators cite the case of <unk> <unk> who is currently serving a <unk> sentence at <unk> federal prison for his role in <unk> investment corp. which promised investors returns of as much as N N on precious metals 
 mr. <unk> who pleaded guilty to five counts of fraud in federal court in los angeles drove a leased mercedes and lived in an expensive home on <unk> <unk> an island in newport 's harbor according to investigators 
 with the $ N million received from investors he took frequent <unk> with friends to exotic <unk> and leased an expensive <unk> for his girlfriend whom he met at the shop where he got his <unk> suits 
 it 's amazing the amount of money that goes up their nose out to the dog track or to the tables in las vegas mr. katz says 
 all this talk of boiler rooms and fraud is <unk> to the city 's legitimate business element 
 vincent <unk> <unk> regional manager of property management systems insists he does n't know of any <unk> <unk> operating in the N million square feet of office space around fashion island that his company leases for irvine co. the owner and developer of the project 
 mr. <unk> has rejected a few prospective tenants who provided incomplete financial information and acknowledges that <unk> operators are not easily <unk> 
 investigators stress that building owners are victims too since boiler rooms often leave without paying rent 
 richard <unk> president of the newport harbor area chamber of commerce calls boiler rooms a negative we wish we could get rid of 
 actually we do n't get much negative publicity about this he insists except for the press who write about it 
 mr. lancaster is deputy chief of the wall street journal 's dallas bureau 
 you went to college and thought you got an education 
 now you discover that you never learned the most important lesson how to send your kids to college 
 true when you went to college there was n't that much to learn 
 stick some money in an <unk> account and watch it grow 
 now investment salesmen say it 's time to take some risks if you want the kind of returns that will buy your <unk> a ticket to prestige <unk> in N years 
 in short throw away the <unk> and go for the glory 
 the reason is cost 
 nothing in the <unk> of tuition <unk> parents for the 1980s 
 <unk> at private colleges rose N N in the N years ended in june of this year that 's twice the N N increase in consumer prices for the same period 
 a year at harvard now goes for $ N 
 by N when this year 's <unk> hit campus a four-year ivy league <unk> will cost $ N give or take a few <unk> at <unk> time 
 stanford mit and other <unk> will cost no less 
 so what 's a parent to do 
 some investment advisers are suggesting in effect a bet on a start-up investment pool maybe even on margin 
 others prefer <unk> zero-coupon bonds 
 still others say why not take a chance on a <unk> growth fund 
 you 're not going to make it in a N N bank account says james <unk> director of mutual funds at t. rowe price 
 to get the necessary growth adds murray <unk> a marketing official at the financial programs mutual-fund group you need to go to the stock market 
 in other words a little volatility never hurt 
 it never hurt anyone that is unless the growth funds do n't grow when you need them to 
 or the zero-coupon bonds turn out not to have been discounted deeply enough to pay your kid 's tuition 
 that 's the dilemma for today 's parent 
 although many experts are advising risk no one has a good answer for you if the risk does n't pay off 
 help may be on the way 
 the antitrust division of the justice department is investigating the oddly similar tuition charges and increases among the top schools 
 fear of the price police could help cool things off in the 1990s 
 and then there 's always state u 
 but parents ' <unk> for a <unk> education for their children is growing like their taste for fancy wheels and vintage wine 
 <unk> aware of public concern lawmakers and financial middlemen are working overtime to create and sell college savings and investment schemes 
 their message explicit or implicit is that a good college will cost so much by whenever you want it that the tried and true wo n't do anymore 
 forget about treasury bills or a money-market fund 
 the latest wave of marketing is <unk> 
 several <unk> including the financial programs franklin and t. rowe price mutual-fund groups and the edward d. jones brokerage house are advertising college planner tables and charts that tell you how much you need to put aside regularly 
 the calculations generally rely on an after-tax rate of return of N N annually a rate historically <unk> by the individual in only one place the stock market 
 most of the <unk> are free but <unk> financial programs sells for $ N a version <unk> to the age of the child and the college of choice 
 the figures are <unk> 
 to build a <unk> egg that would pay for stanford when a current <unk> reaches college age parents would need to set aside $ N a month for N years 
 they can cut this to $ N a month if the investing keeps up through college 
 and they can further reduce the monthly amount if they start saving earlier when mother and child come home from the hospital 
 <unk> a cheaper college into the <unk> still does n't generate an installment most people can live with 
 using a recent average <unk> cost of about $ N a year t. rowe price 's planner <unk> $ N monthly if the plan begins when the child is six 
 since the formula assumes an N N <unk> return in a mutual fund there would also be $ N in taxes to pay over the N years 
 not everyone is so pessimistic 
 people are basically peddling a lot of fear says arthur <unk> a consultant to the american council on education in washington 
 he takes issue with projections that do n't factor in students ' own contribution which reduces most parents ' burden substantially 
 still he says it 's no bad thing if all the marketing <unk> people into putting aside a little more 
 the situation you want to avoid is having somebody not save anything and hope they 'll be able to do it out of current income he says 
 that 's crazy 
 his advice do n't panic 
 parents he says should aim at whatever regular investment sum they can afford 
 half the amount that the investment tables suggest might be a good goal he adds 
 that way parents will reduce borrowings and outlays from current income when the time comes to pay tuition 
 mr. <unk> <unk> that the best investment choice is mutual funds because they are managed and over time have nearly kept up with the broad stock averages 
 he favors either an <unk> fund or a balanced fund that <unk> both stocks and bonds 
 in their anxiety however parents and other student <unk> are <unk> to new schemes 
 they have laid out about $ N billion for so-called <unk> zero-coupon municipal bonds so far offered by connecticut illinois virginia and eight other states 
 and they have bought about $ N million in <unk> plans offered in michigan florida and wyoming 
 the prepaid plans take payment today usually at current <unk> or at a slight discount for a promise that tuition will be covered tomorrow 
 the <unk> bonds tax-free offered in small denominations and usually containing a provision that they wo n't be called before maturity seem to be <unk> for college <unk> 
 like other <unk> they pay all their interest at maturity meaning that buyers can time things so that their bonds pay off just when junior graduates from high school 
 their <unk> effect is also <unk> 
 in june virginia sold bonds for $ N that will pay $ N in N 
 but richard anderson head of the forum for college financing alternatives at columbia university a research group partly financed by the federal government says <unk> are particularly <unk> 
 their price falls further than that of other bonds when inflation and interest rates kick up 
 that wo n't matter if they are held to maturity but if for any reason the parents need to sell them before then there could be a severe loss of principal 
 had <unk> been available in N and had parents bought a face amount equal to four years ' tuition at the time aiming for their children 's N <unk> they would have been left with only enough to pay for two years mr. anderson figures 
 most other bonds however would probably not have fared much better 
 the prepaid plans may be a good bet provided the guarantee of future tuition is secure 
 issuing states generally limit the guarantees to <unk> institutions however and buyers get refunds without much interest if the children do n't attend the specified schools 
 two private groups are seeking securities and exchange commission approval for plans that could be more broadly <unk> 
 mr. anderson wants the prestige colleges to sponsor such a plan 
 the issue here may be the <unk> of the guarantee 
 prepayments much like mutual-fund purchases are <unk> for investment 
 sponsors are naturally counting on their ability to keep ahead of tuition inflation with investment returns 
 but buyers are essentially betting on a start-up investment fund with no track record and some have been encouraged to borrow to do so 
 one problem is that the internal revenue service has decided that the investment earnings and gains of the sponsors ' funds are taxable 
 the colleges as educational institutions had hoped that would n't be the case 
 based on historical rates of return mr. anderson <unk> a N N stock portfolio <unk> to the market would have kept up with tuition and taxes in the 20th century 
 but sponsors might not pick the stocks that will match the market 
 and they 're <unk> more toward fixed income whose returns after tax have trailed tuition increases 
 i 'm not sure they 're going to make it work says mr. anderson 
 what happens if the sponsors do n't have the cash to pay the <unk> 
 florida and wyoming have backed up their guarantees with the full faith and credit of the state governments meaning that taxpayers will pick up any slack 
 not so michigan 
 its plan is set up as an independent agency

 among the <unk> farmers in the <unk> delta land of <unk> county <unk> allen d. tharp of <unk> was one of the best known and most <unk> 
 he sold <unk> <unk> to stock other farmers ' <unk> and he bought back <unk> <unk> that he <unk> to market along with his own <unk> crop 
 and he nearly always bought and sold for cash 
 along the way mr. tharp omitted a total of $ N million from his receipts reported on federal tax returns for three years 
 the returns landed in the hands of an internal revenue service criminal investigator samuel james baker 
 mr. baker interviewed or wrote to hundreds of <unk> farmers <unk> and processors throughout the south before coming up with detailed estimates of purchases and sales in pounds and dollars by mr. tharp and others 
 unknown to mr. tharp he had <unk> his net on a special irs project to catch <unk> farmers and <unk> inclined to <unk> on their taxes 
 confronted with the evidence mr. tharp pleaded guilty to one charge of filing a false return and was fined $ N and sentenced to N months in prison 
 he also owes a lot of back taxes interest and civil fraud penalties 
 a lot of taxpayers out there are n't as <unk> as one might think 
 federal and state tax enforcers develop many group targets for investigation on the basis of <unk> high income type of income or some other characteristic that may signal an opportunity or tendency to hide income or <unk> deductions 
 many <unk> long have seemed to be targets because of the exotic or <unk> efforts of some members to offset high income with fake losses from phony tax shelters <unk> who invested in <unk> dubbed foreign films or airline pilots who raised <unk> on their days off 
 mail-order ministers have been <unk> 
 now television and radio <unk> are under scrutiny 
 the irs recently won part of its <unk> battle with the church of <unk> over <unk> when the u.s. supreme court held that members ' payments to the church were n't deductible because the members received services in return 
 irs statistics show that the more persistent <unk> of income among sole <unk> of businesses include <unk> dealers entertainment producers <unk> <unk> and taxi owners 
 small businesses in general account for almost N N of <unk> personal income the irs has said 
 once such abuses become so pervasive the irs builds another factor into its secret computer formula for <unk> returns for audit and does n't need special projects for them 
 san <unk> have a much higher <unk> of audits than average because more of them score high under that formula not because irs agents envy their life styles 
 many <unk> for mass cheating such as questionable tax shelters and home offices have <unk> so broadly that congress has passed <unk> laws to close them 
 deductions of charitable gifts of highly valued art now must be accompanied by <unk> 
 and laws requiring the reporting of more <unk> of transactions have enabled the irs to rely on computers to <unk> out discrepancies with returns and to generate <unk> inquiries to taxpayers 
 <unk> <unk> income can be spotted by computer because a <unk> of <unk> who gets a deduction must report the former spouse 's social security number 
 <unk> applicants now must give social security numbers enabling the irs to see whether americans living abroad are filing required u.s. returns 
 but while irs computers focus routinely on target groups like these the agency has assigned many agents to special projects that need more personal attention 
 in most cases the irs says these projects are local or regional rather than national and arise because auditors in an area detect some pattern of abuse among say factory workers claiming that having a <unk> of dependents <unk> them from tax <unk> or <unk> owners <unk> losses from sideline charter businesses 
 the national office currently has N <unk> audit projects according to marshall v. <unk> deputy assistant commissioner for examination 
 auditors involved in <unk> projects ca n't send anyone to jail but they can make life <unk> in other ways for one by imposing some of the N different civil penalties for negligence failure to file a return and the like 
 the targeted audit groups include direct sellers people who sell cosmetics <unk> and other items door to door or at home parties and employers who label workers as independent contractors instead of employees to avoid the employer share of payroll taxes 
 other projects look for offenders among <unk> who get cash tips people who engage in large cash transactions and people whose returns show they sold a home for a profit without <unk> the capital gain in another home by the end of the same year the gain must be rolled over within two years to defer tax 
 and now that returns must show dependents ' social security numbers the irs wants to see which dependents show up on more than one return and which dependents turn out to be <unk> 
 impetus for the <unk> project came from a congressional hearing some years back 
 it prompted an irs study that found many sellers were <unk> income and treating large amounts of <unk> travel and other personal expenses as business costs mr. <unk> says 
 the study provided criteria for <unk> out returns of potentially <unk> taxpayers who report low income and large expenses from a <unk> business 
 the tax court recently denied business deductions by mr. and mrs. peter s. rubin of cherry hill n.j. who both were <unk> distributors of <unk> products in addition to their regular jobs as sales people in other fields 
 for N they reported gross income of $ N from <unk> sales offset by expenses totaling $ N including car costs of $ N and travel and entertainment costs of $ N 
 the tax court did n't believe that the <unk> who earned $ N in their regular jobs treated the sideline as a real business and derived merely <unk> elements of recreation and other personal pleasure and benefits from it 
 the direct selling association a trade group points out that its members which include <unk> corp. cooperate with the irs to distribute <unk> material to sales people and are helping to prepare a <unk> television program on the subject 
 the <unk> project which began in N involves about N irs agents 
 in the fiscal nine months ended june N reports raymond p. keenan assistant commissioner for collection they examined about N employers assessed more than $ N million in <unk> employment taxes and <unk> about N workers as employees instead of self-employed contractors 
 the number of <unk> workers may be in the millions mostly paid by small firms 
 many workers especially professionals want to remain independent to avoid tax <unk> and to continue to <unk> many expenses that employees ca n't 
 but many others who want to qualify for employee benefits and unemployment compensation become <unk> for the irs says jerry <unk> who manages the irs project 's force of nine agents in north and central florida from <unk> 
 firms that are paying employment taxes also provide leads to competitors that are n't he says 
 in his area mr. <unk> continues the <unk> employers most commonly are in construction doing <unk> <unk> <unk> and similar work 
 but a medical clinic with about N employees <unk> listed all of them including physicians and <unk> as independent contractors 
 the irs assessed the clinic $ N in back payroll taxes 
 it assessed nearly $ N against a <unk> company that carried about N <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and other employees as self-employed <unk> 
 <unk> states also are becoming more aggressive <unk> of tax <unk> and perhaps none tracks them down with more <unk> than does new york since it acquired an $ N million computer system in N 
 the state 's tax enforcers have <unk> data bases from other new york agencies that license or register professionals and businesses from exchange agreements with the irs N other states and two canadian provinces and even from <unk> yellow pages 
 thus armed for massive matching of documents by computer they single out <unk> groups looking primarily for people who have n't filed new york income-tax returns 
 the state has <unk> through records relating to architects stockbrokers lawyers in the new york city area construction workers from out of the state and homeowners who claim to be residents of other states especially florida which has no personal income tax 
 soon to feel the glare of attention are lawyers elsewhere in the state doctors <unk> and accountants says frederick g. <unk> director of the <unk> division that develops the <unk> programs 
 the department has collected over $ N million from brokers so far and recommended more than N of them for criminal prosecution 
 in the early stage of checking people with incomes exceeding $ N who were filing <unk> returns it squeezed $ N million out of a man who was <unk> as a florida resident 
 we think we can reclaim hundreds of millions of dollars just through the <unk> project mr. <unk> declares 
 mr. <unk> is editor of the wall street journal 's tax report column 
 in finding good news in berkeley 's new freshman <unk> plan the <unk> class editorial sept. N you 're reading the headline but not the story 
 the plan indeed raises from N N to N N the number of <unk> applicants admitted strictly by academic criteria 
 but that does n't mean half of the students attending berkeley will be admitted this way 
 the plan is talking about applicants admitted not students who <unk> 
 since the yield from this top <unk> of applicants is relatively low boosting admits from N N to N N will boost <unk> from about N N to N N of the class 
 in addition perhaps N N of <unk> will come from a new category consisting of applicants whose academic credentials narrowly missed gaining them admission in the first category 
 but against that combined increase of N N in students chosen by academic criteria the plan <unk> a large category in which <unk> now are based on grades test scores and supplemental points for factors such as high-school <unk> <unk> <unk> and an <unk> 
 this category now accounts for about N N of admits and N N of <unk> 
 the plan thus will decrease by N N for a net loss of N N the number of students admitted primarily by academic criteria 
 who will take over these places 
 the plan creates a new category of students from <unk> <unk> backgrounds a concept not yet defined and gives them about N N of the class 
 one of the plan 's authors has defended the <unk> disadvantage category as perhaps making more sense than the current <unk> preferences based on race 
 perhaps it does 
 but the new category does not replace or reduce berkeley 's broad racial preferences 
 nor will students from <unk> groups who are admitted through the new category be counted against the <unk> target for their group 
 the plan thus places a large new <unk> program based on <unk> disadvantage on top of the existing program based on race 
 the role of academic criteria in choosing berkeley 's <unk> can only decline as a result

 this is a story about <unk> 
 most of us know a <unk> 
 many of us are <unk> 
 but what we may not know is just what makes somebody a <unk> 
 what makes people <unk> out their credit-card numbers to a caller they 've never heard of 
 do they really believe that the number is just for <unk> and is simply a <unk> on the road to being a <unk> winner 
 what makes a person buy an oil well from some <unk> knocking on the screen door 
 or an interest in a retirement community in nevada that will knock your <unk> off once it is built 
 because in the end these people always wind up asking themselves the same question how could i be so stupid 
 there are unfortunately plenty of answers to that question and <unk> artists know all of them 
 these people are very skilled at finding out what makes a person <unk> says kent neal chief of the <unk> unit of the <unk> county state attorney 's office in fort <unk> fla. a major haven for boiler rooms 
 once they size them up then they know what <unk> to push 
 john <unk> agrees and he ought to know 
 he used to be a <unk> salesman peddling investments in oil and gas wells and rare coins 
 there 's a <unk> psychology of the sale and different <unk> you pitch different ways he says 
 the most obvious pitch of course is the lure of big returns 
 we 're all a little greedy 
 everyone is vulnerable says charles harper associate regional administrator for the securities and exchange commission in miami 
 these guys <unk> on human <unk> 
 while the promises of big profits ought to set off warning bells they often do n't in part because <unk> <unk> have become <unk> in american <unk> 
 the overnight success story is part of our culture and our society puts an emphasis on it with <unk> and ed <unk> making <unk> out of people says michael <unk> an associate professor of psychology at the university of kentucky in louisville

 adds spencer <unk> branch chief for enforcement at the sec in fort worth texas why do people play the <unk> when the odds are great against them 
 people are shooting for a dream 
 clearly though <unk> artists have to be a bit more <unk> than simply promising millions the psychology of <unk> is n't simply the psychology of the greedy 
 there 's also for instance the need to be part of the <unk> 
 so one popular <unk> is to make a prospective investor feel like an insider joining an exclusive group that is about to make a killing 
 between N and N for instance <unk> oil in winter haven fla. sold interests in oil wells to a very select group of local residents while turning away numerous other eager investors 
 the owner of the company stephen smith who has since pleaded guilty to state and federal fraud charges <unk> to investors that he had a secret agreement with amoco oil co. and said the location of his wells was confidential according to a civil suit filed in a florida state court by the florida comptroller 's office 
 neither the amoco agreement nor the wells existed the suit alleged 
 such schemes says tony <unk> chief of the <unk> unit of the federal bureau of investigation in washington d.c. appeal to investors ' desire to believe this is really true and that they are part of a chosen group being given this opportunity 
 at times salesmen may <unk> the inside information with the notion that this is some slightly <unk> slightly illegal investment the person is being included in says mr. <unk> 
 in appealing to those with a bit of <unk> in their hearts the fraud artist can insist that a person keep an investment secret <unk> himself from being discovered and keeping his victim from consulting with others 
 it also adds to the mystery of the venture 
 mr. <unk> the <unk> veteran believes that for many investors the <unk> scams carry a <unk> element of excitement 
 once people got into it i was allowing them to live a dream he says 
 he <unk> them with <unk> on the investment such as funny things that happened at the well that week he says

 for some investors it 's the appearances that leave them <unk> 
 the <unk> of success go a long way wearing the right clothes doing the right things says paul <unk> an associate professor of psychology at harvard 
 conservative appearances make people think it 's a conservative investment 
 people <unk> lose money on risky investments that they did n't realize were a <unk> he says 
 paul <unk> a phoenix ariz. attorney says a promise of <unk> returns would have made him leery 
 but mr. <unk> who says he lost $ N in one <unk> deal and $ N in another says a salesman used a <unk> approach with him sending investment literature a contract limiting the firm 's liability and an insurance policy 
 when he visited the company 's office he says it had all the <unk> of legitimacy 
 still others are <unk> by a desire to do both well and good says douglas watson commanding officer of the los angeles police department 's <unk> division 
 <unk> <unk> are the most visible targets of unscrupulous <unk> investment pitches 
 but hardly the only ones the scams promise among other things to help save the environment feed <unk> families and prevent the disappearance of children 
 <unk> say isolated people who do n't discuss their investments with others are particularly at risk for fraud 
 <unk> artists seek out such people or try to make sure that their victims <unk> themselves 
 for instance salesmen may counter a man 's <unk> that he wants to discuss an investment with his wife by asking who wears the <unk> in your family 
 or an investor who wants his <unk> 's advice may be told you seem like a guy who can make up his own mind 
 often con artists will try to <unk> their victims by <unk> <unk> between them

 fox hunting has been defined as the <unk> in pursuit of the <unk> but at least it 's exercise 
 at least it has a little <unk> 
 most of us have to spend our time on <unk> that afford neither <unk> duties rather than <unk> 
 like trying to buy life insurance for instance an <unk> notably lacking in <unk> 
 call it the <unk> <unk> after the <unk> 
 but sooner or later most of us have to think about life insurance just as we often have to think about having <unk> work 
 and my time has come 
 i 'm N married no children and employed in writing stories like this one 
 in times past life-insurance salesmen targeted heads of household meaning men but <unk> is a <unk> family and accustomed to it 
 so if anything happened to me i 'd want to leave behind enough so that my <unk> husband would be able to pay off the mortgage and some other debts though not i admit enough to put any potential second wife in the <unk> of luxury 
 figuring that maybe $ N to $ N would do but having no idea of what kind of policy i wanted i looked at the <unk> products of a dozen companies and plunged into a <unk> of <unk> 
 over the past decade or two while i was thinking about fox hunting the insurance industry has spawned an incredible number of products variations on products and variations on the variations 
 besides term life and whole life the old <unk> we now have universal life universal <unk> life flexible adjustable universal life policies with <unk> bonuses policies <unk> with exotic riders living benefit policies and on and on 
 what to do 
 first <unk> 
 <unk> of all their riders special provisions and other bells and <unk> insurance policies can still be <unk> under two broad categories so-called pure insurance which <unk> no cash value in the policy and pays off only upon death and permanent insurance which provides not only a death benefit but also a cash value in the policy that can be used in various ways while the insured is still alive 
 if all you want is <unk> coverage pure insurance a term policy gives you maximum bang for your buck within limits 
 it 's much cheaper than permanent insurance bought at the same age 
 but term means just that the policy is written for a specific time period only and must be renewed when it expires 
 it may also <unk> that the insured must pass another medical <unk> before renewal if you <unk> which means you need insurance more than ever you may not be able to buy it 
 even if you 're healthy and can renew your premium will go up sharply because you 're that much older 
 so term insurance may not be as cheap as it looks 
 there are all sorts of variations on term insurance policies structured to pay off your mortgage debt term riders tacked on to permanent insurance and many others 
 one <unk> that appealed to me at first was the money smart term life policy offered by amex life insurance co. the american express unit to the parent company 's credit-card holders 
 upon examination however i <unk> whether the plan made a lot of sense 
 amex said it would charge me $ N a year for $ N of coverage and would pay me back all the premiums i put in if i canceled the policy after N years 
 sounds great or does it 
 first if i canceled i 'd have no more insurance a not <unk> consideration 
 second the $ N i 'd get back would be much diminished in purchasing power by N years of inflation amex not i would get the benefit of the investment income on my money income that would have exceeded the inflation rate and thus given the company a real profit 
 third and most important amex would charge me a far higher premium than other reputable companies would on a straight term policy for the same amount i 'd be paying so heavily just to have the option of getting my premiums back that i 'd almost have to cancel to make the whole thing <unk> 
 that would be all right with amex which could then lock in its investment profit but it does n't add up to a smart money move for me 
 which goes to show that the first law applies in insurance as in anything else there is no free lunch there is only marketing 
 and the second law unique to insurance 
 if i die early i win a <unk> victory since i ca n't enjoy it and if i live long the insurer wins 
 always 
 this is worth <unk> when insurers and their salesmen try to sell you permanent insurance the kind that <unk> cash value 
 the word death can not be escaped entirely by the industry but salesmen dodge it wherever possible or <unk> it in <unk> <unk> to talk about savings and investment instead 
 the implication is that your <unk> policy is really some kind of cd or mutual-fund account with an added feature 
 that is <unk> the <unk> 
 the fact is that as a savings or investment vehicle insurance generally runs a poor second to any direct investment you might make in the same things the insurance company is putting your money into 
 that 's because you have to pay for the insurance portion of the policy and the effort required to sell and service the whole package 
 again no free lunch 
 this is reflected in a <unk> mortality cost in effect your share of the company 's estimated liability in paying off beneficiaries of people who had the <unk> to die while under its protection 
 and in most cases a huge <unk> of your premium in the initial year or two of the the policy is in effect paying the salesman 's commission as well investment returns on most policies are actually negative for several years largely because of this 
 so view permanent insurance for what it is a compromise between pure insurance and direct investment 
 the <unk> most traditional form of permanent insurance is the straight whole life policy 
 you pay a set premium for a set amount of coverage the company invests that premium in a portfolio of its choosing and your cash value and dividends grow over the years 
 one newer <unk> so called <unk> life you pay for the whole policy at once has been <unk> popular in recent years for tax reasons the insured could extract cash value in the form of policy loans and none of the proceeds were taxable even though they included gains on investment 
 congress closed this <unk> last year or thought it did 
 however <unk> capital corp. of <unk> mass. has developed a combination plan of annuity and insurance coverage that it says does not violate the new regulations and that allows policy loans without tax consequences 
 but the percentage of your cash reserve that you can borrow tax-free is very small 
 i 'm not prepared in any case to put that much money into a policy immediately so i look into the broad category called universal life 
 <unk> popular it is far more flexible than straight whole life 
 i can adjust the amount of insurance i want against the amount going into investment i can pay more or less than the so-called target premium in a given year and i can even <unk> payments if my cash reserves are enough to cover the insurance portion of the policy 
 in looking at these and other policies i learn to ask pointed questions about some of the assumptions built into policy <unk> the rows of numbers that show me the buildup of my cash values over the years 
 they commonly give two scenarios one is based on interest rates that the company guarantees usually N N to N N and the other on the rate it is currently getting on investment often N N or more 
 projecting the latter over several decades i find my cash buildup is impressive but can any high interest rate prevail for that long 
 not likely i think 
 also some policy <unk> assume that mortality costs will decline or that i will get some sort of dividend bonus after the <unk> year 
 these are not certain either 
 companies are n't comfortable playing these games but they realize they 're under pressure to make their policies look good says timothy <unk> an <unk> consultant at <unk> a unit of towers <unk> co. the big new york consulting firm 
 another factor to consider some of the companies currently earning very high yields are doing so through substantial investment in junk bonds and you know how nervous the market has been about those lately 
 there are seemingly endless <unk> to universal life and it pays to ask questions about all of them 
 at a <unk> <unk> for example a friend boasts that she 'll only have to pay premiums on her john hancock policy for seven years and that her death benefits will then be guaranteed 
 i call her agent david <unk> 
 yes he says premiums on such <unk> coverage can be structured to <unk> after a certain period but usually only if interest rates stay high enough to generate sufficient cash to cover the annual cost of insurance protection 
 if interest rates plunge the insurer may be knocking on my door asking for <unk> premium payments to maintain the same amount of protection 
 i do n't like the sound of that 
 some insurers have also started offering <unk> bonuses such as extra dividends or a marginally higher interest yield if the policy is maintained for N years 
 but glenn daily a new york-based financial consultant warns that many of these bonuses are just <unk> because most are n't guaranteed by the companies 
 and the feature is so new he adds that no insurer has yet established a track record for actually making such payments 
 so-called <unk> provisions also merit a close inspection 
 offered by insurers that include <unk> life insurance co. jackson national life insurance co. and national travelers life insurance co. these policy riders let me tap a portion of my death benefits while i 'm still alive 
 some provisions would let me collect a percentage of the policy 's face value to pay for long-term care such as <unk> stays others would allow payments for catastrophic <unk> and conditions such as cancer heart <unk> <unk> failure and kidney transplants 
 but the catastrophic events for which the <unk> can collect are narrowly defined vary from policy to policy and generally permit use of only a small fraction of the face amount of insurance 
 also financial planners advising on insurance say that to their knowledge there has not yet been a tax ruling <unk> these advance payments from taxes 
 and considering the extra cost of such provisions some figure that people interested in say paying for extended <unk> care would be better off just buying a separate policy that provides it 
 i 'm more <unk> impressed by <unk> life even though it turns out to be <unk> life 
 <unk> selling these policies market them directly to the public or otherwise do n't use commissioned salesmen there is still a load annual administrative fees and initial <unk> charges but i figure that the lack of commission and of surrender fees for dropping the policy early still <unk> me a lot 
 i compared one universal policy for $ N face amount from such an insurer american life insurance corp. of lincoln neb. with a similar offering from equitable life assurance society of the u.s. which operates through N commissioned salesmen 
 after one year i could walk away from the <unk> policy with $ N but <unk> get only $ N from the equitable 
 the difference is magnified by time too 
 at age N when i 'd stop paying premiums the <unk> offering would have a projected cash value $ N higher than the other even though the equitable 's policy illustration assumed a fractionally higher interest rate 
 did i buy it 
 well not yet 
 i 'm thinking about using the $ N annual premium to finance a trip to paris first 
 a person can do some heavy thinking about insurance there and shop for something more exciting while she 's doing it 
 rorer group inc. will report that third-quarter profit rose more than N N from a year earlier though the gain is wholly due to asset sales robert <unk> chairman president and chief executive officer said 
 his projection indicates profit in the latest quarter of more than $ N million or N cents a share compared with $ N million or N cents a share a year ago 
 mr. <unk> said in an interview that sales will show an increase from a year ago of somewhat less than N N 
 through the first six months of N sales had grown about N N from the year-earlier period 
 growth of N N would make sales for the latest quarter $ N million compared with $ N million a year ago 
 mr. <unk> said the profit growth in the latest quarter was due to the sale of two rorer drugs 
 <unk> an <unk> was sold to <unk> plc london 
 <unk> a drug used to <unk> bleeding was sold to jones medical industries inc. st. louis 
 he said rorer sold the drugs for nice prices and will record a combined pretax gain on the sales of $ N million

 if you think you have stress-related problems on the job there 's good news and bad news 
 you 're probably right and you are n't alone 
 a new <unk> poll study commissioned by the new york business group on health found that a full N N of the work force at companies may suffer from anxiety disorders or a stress-related illness with about N N suffering from depression 
 the study surveyed a national group of medical directors personnel managers and employee assistance program directors about their perceptions of these problems in their companies 
 it is one of a series of studies on health commissioned by the new york business group a <unk> organization with about N members 
 the stress study was undertaken because problems related to stress are much more <unk> than they seem said leon j. <unk> executive director of the business group 
 in <unk> the study late last week dr. <unk> estimated the cost of these types of disorders to business is substantial 
 <unk> <unk> related to anxiety depression and stress costs about $ N a case in terms of worker 's compensation 
 in terms of days lost on the job the study estimated that each affected employee loses about N work days a year because of stress anxiety or depression 
 he added that the cost for stress-related compensation claims is about twice the average for all injury claims 
 we hope to <unk> employers to recognize the problems so they can do something about them dr. <unk> said 
 early intervention into these types of problems can apparently save businesses long-term expense associated with <unk> which sometimes results when these problems go <unk> for too long 
 even the courts are beginning to recognize the link between jobs and stress-related disorders in compensation cases according to a survey by the national council on compensation insurance

 it is n't true that a <unk> old <unk> on a mission of <unk> to a disaster area on christmas day can fly free 
 but his circumstances are among the few that can qualify for the handful of really cheap airline tickets remaining in america 
 in recent years carriers have become much more <unk> about who can fly on the cheap 
 but there still are a few ways today 's <unk> can qualify under the airline 's many restrictions 
 one of the best deals though may mean <unk> christmas dinner with the <unk> 
 this week many carriers are announcing <unk> fares designed to get people to fly on some of the most <unk> and <unk> days of the year including christmas 
 in recent years the airlines had waited until the last moment to court christmas season <unk> with bargain fares 
 that approach <unk> last christmas day a usair group inc. <unk> jetliner flew about seven passengers from chicago to pittsburgh

 continental a texas air corp. unit recently unveiled a marketing program offering free companion tickets to <unk> and <unk> passengers on international flights

 imagine a widow who wants to maintain her standard of living at the same level she had before she had to pay the catastrophic <unk> 
 although this widow earns only twice the minimum wage largely due to the earnings limit she would have to earn an additional $ N to offset her catastrophic <unk> of $ N 
 eliminating the earnings limit would greatly help seniors and reduce the deficit 
 repeal would generate more in new taxes than the government would lose in increased social security benefit payments

 when his seventh avenue fur business here was flying high N years ago jack <unk> had N workers and a large factory 
 now his <unk> employees work in an <unk> shop that he says is smaller than his old storage room 
 he also says he is losing money now 
 he blames imports 
 but just down seventh avenue where about N N of u.s. fur <unk> are made larry rosen has acquired two retail outlets <unk> his <unk> line and expanded into leather 
 he credits imports 
 the difference lies in how the two entrepreneurial furriers reacted to the foreign competition and <unk> of their industry over the past N years 
 one stuck to <unk> business <unk> while the other embraced the change 
 the small good fur salon is not what it used to be says mr. <unk> N years old 
 we make the <unk> product in the world and the americans are being kicked around 
 mr. rosen though believes imports have <unk> the industry in which he has worked for most of his N years 
 you 've got some minds here that wo n't think <unk> he says 
 import competition for u.s. furs has risen sharply since furriers started aggressively marketing <unk> mink and similar <unk> imported furs in recent years 
 merchants discovered a consumer largely ignored by <unk> furriers the younger woman even in her late <unk> who never thought she could buy a mink 
 the new market helped boost u.s. fur sales to about $ N billion a year now triple the level in the late 1970s 
 it also opened the door to furs made in south korea china hong kong and other countries 
 <unk> furs a large south korean maker says it operates N retail outlets in the u.s. and plans to open N more by the end of next year 
 mr. <unk> and other <unk> furriers call many of the the imports <unk> and poorly made 
 high-end u.s. furriers say these imports have n't squeezed them 
 but <unk> and <unk> furriers like mr. <unk> who once <unk> the <unk> seventh avenue fur district say imports have cut their sales 
 a woman who once would have saved for two or three seasons to buy a <unk> mink can now get an imported mink right away for less than $ N 
 yet mr. rosen has turned the import phenomenon to his advantage 
 early in the decade he saw that fur workers in many foreign countries were willing to work longer hours at lower wages than their american counterparts and were more open to innovation 
 in N he started a factory in greece 
 two years later he opened one in west germany 
 he also noticed that foreign makers were introducing many variations on the traditional fur and he decided to follow suit 
 by combining his strengths in innovation and quality control with the lower costs of production abroad he says he has been able to produce high-quality goods at low cost 
 to maintain control over production and avoid <unk> on foreign sources he says he still makes most of his furs in the u.s. 
 but six years ago he also began importing from the far east 
 inspired by imports mr. rosen now makes fur <unk> hats and <unk> 
 this year he produced a men 's line and offers <unk> furs in red cherry red <unk> royal blue and forest green 
 he has leather jackets from turkey that are lined with <unk> skin and topped off with <unk> <unk> 
 from asia he has mink jackets with <unk> patterns made by using different <unk> furs 
 next he will be testing <unk> <unk> called <unk> made in the far east 
 he plans to <unk> the <unk> to the backs of mink coats and jackets 
 besides adding to sales <unk> also attract retailers who may buy furs later he adds 
 other furriers have also benefited from <unk> 
 seymour <unk> the <unk> owner of <unk> <unk> furs inc. <unk> the reverse side of a persian <unk> to produce a <unk> <unk> <unk> 
 he says it accounts for N N of total sales 
 mr. rosen is also pushing retail sales 
 this year he bought two stores one in brooklyn and one in <unk> 
 other furriers have also placed more weight on retailing 
 golden <unk> furs inc. began retailing aggressively eight years ago and now retail sales account for about N N of gross income 
 in other moves mr. rosen says he bought a truck three years ago to reach more retailers 
 since then he has expanded his fleet and can now bring his furs to the front door of retailers as far away as the midwest 
 small retailers who ca n't afford to travel to his new york showroom have become fair game 
 such moves have helped mr. rosen weather the industry slump of recent years 
 the industry enjoyed six <unk> years beginning in N but since N sales have <unk> at their $ N billion peak 
 large furriers such as <unk> inc. fur vault inc. and evans inc. all reported losses in their latest fiscal years 
 <unk> of the N stock market crash head the list of reasons 
 in addition competition has <unk> the market with both <unk> and coats driving prices down 
 the <unk> movement has n't helped sales 
 warm <unk> over the past two years have trimmed demand too furriers complain 
 and those who did n't move some production overseas suffer labor shortages 
 the intensive labor needed to manufacture furs in the u.s. is not as available as it was says mr. <unk> who is starting overseas production 
 but even those who have found a way to cope with the imports and the slump fear that furs are losing part of their <unk> 
 people are promoting furs in various ways and taking the <unk> out of the fur business says stephen <unk> <unk> merchandise manager for marshall field 's department store in chicago 
 you ca n't make a commodity out of a luxury insists mr. <unk> the new york <unk> 
 he contends that chasing consumers with <unk> imports will harm the industry in the long run by reducing the prestige of furs 
 but mr. rosen <unk> whatever people want to buy i 'll sell 
 the name of the game is to move goods

 in a speech prepared for delivery to london 's financial community mr. lawson <unk> up current economic policy as a battle to <unk> inflation out of the british economy using high interest rates as the essential instrument to carry out the campaign 
 two weeks after boosting base rates to N N he pledged that rates will have to remain high for some time to come 
 mr. lawson also made it clear that he would be watching exchange rates carefully 
 a sinking pound makes imports more expensive and increases businesses ' expectations of future inflation he argued 
 in an apparent warning to currency traders who have lately been selling the british currency he stated that the exchange rates will have a major role in the assessment of monetary conditions 
 in <unk> the current monetary policy of using high interest rates to fight inflation and shore up the pound mr. lawson dismissed other approaches to managing the economy 
 he said he monitors the <unk> figures but does n't give them paramount importance as some private and government economists have suggested 
 mr. lawson also dismissed the possibility of imposing direct credit controls on britain 's financial system 
 mr. lawson 's speech delivered at the lord mayor of london 's annual dinner at mansion house came on the heels of a <unk> period for the u.k. economy 
 two weeks ago in a campaign to blunt inflation at home and arrest a world-wide plunge in the pound he raised base rates a full percentage point to N N 
 despite the increase the british currency slid below a perceived <unk> of three marks early last week 
 it was quoted at N marks in late new york trading wednesday 
 leading up to the speech was a <unk> of economic statistics suggesting that the british war on inflation will be more <unk> than previously assumed 
 unemployment in september dropped to N the lowest level since N 
 while lower <unk> is generally good news the hefty drop last month indicates that the economy is n't slowing down as much as hoped despite a doubling of interest rates over the last N months

 specifically he pointed out that compared with the u.s. market the u.k. has far fewer highly leveraged junk-bond financings

 c. olivetti & co. claiming it has won the race in europe to introduce computers based on a powerful new microprocessor chip unveiled its <unk> computer yesterday 
 the product is the first from a european company based on intel corp. 's new <unk> <unk> microprocessor which works several times faster than previously available chips 
 hewlett-packard co. became the first company world-wide to announce a product based on the chip earlier this month but it wo n't start shipping the computers until early next year 
 an olivetti spokesman said the company 's factories are already beginning to produce the machine and that it should be available in europe by december 
 what this means is that europeans will have these machines in their offices before americans do the spokesman said 
 the new chip is a very big step in computing and it is important that olivetti be one of the first out on the market with this product said <unk> <unk> davis an analyst at james capel & co. in london 
 executives at olivetti whose earnings have been steadily sliding over the past couple of years have acknowledged that in the past they have lagged at getting new technology to market 
 ms. davis said the new machines could steal some sales away from olivetti 's own minicomputers but would bring new sales among professionals such as engineers stockbrokers and medical doctors 
 although olivetti 's profits tumbled N N in the first half of this year she believes olivetti 's restructuring last fall and its introduction of new products will begin to bear fruit with an earnings rebound next year especially if it can fulfill its promise to deliver the new machines by december 
 we think the worst is over in the european <unk> market she said 
 depending on the type of software and peripherals used the machines can serve either as the main computer in a network of many terminals a role usually filled by a <unk> as a technical workstation or as a very fast personal computer 
 it 's the missing link in olivetti 's product line between small personal computers and <unk> minicomputers the olivetti spokesman said 
 he added that olivetti will continue making its <unk> <unk> line 
 the machines will cost around $ N on average in europe 
 the intel N chip can process N million instructions per second or mips while intel 's previous N chip could handle only N to N mips 
 olivetti also plans to sell the <unk> computer in the u.s. starting next year through olivetti usa and through its <unk> <unk> unit which specializes in <unk> <unk> networks

 <unk> houses are expected to report earnings increases of about N N on average for the third quarter despite sales increases of less than N N analysts say 
 to offset sluggish sales growth companies have been cutting staff mostly through <unk> and slowing the growth in research and development spending 
 sales growth in the quarter was slowed by mounting pressure from groups of buyers such as hospitals to hold down prices 
 suppliers were also hurt by the stronger u.s. dollar which makes sales abroad more difficult

 these figures are n't seasonally adjusted

 dec shares rose $ N to $ N apiece in consolidated new york stock exchange trading yesterday

 some cut their earnings estimates for the stock this year and predicted more efforts to control costs ahead

 dec said its overseas business which now accounts for more than half of sales improved in the quarter

 colgate <unk> co. reported third-quarter net income rose N N bolstered by strong sales in its latin american business and surprisingly healthy profits from u.s. operations 
 colgate said net income for the quarter rose to $ N million or $ N a share on sales that increased N N to $ N billion 
 in the year-earlier period colgate posted net income of $ N million or N cents a share 
 last year 's results included earnings from discontinued operations of $ N million or N cents a share 
 <unk> mark chairman and chief executive officer of colgate said earnings growth was fueled by strong sales in latin america the far east and europe 
 results were also bolstered by a very meaningful increase in operating profit at colgate 's u.s. business he said 
 operating profit at colgate 's u.s. household products and personal care businesses which include such well-known brands as colgate <unk> and <unk> <unk> detergent jumped more than N N the company said 
 mr. mark attributed the improvement to cost savings achieved by consolidating manufacturing operations <unk> together two sales organizations and more carefully focusing the company 's promotional activities 
 we 've done a lot to improve u.s. results and a lot more will be done mr. mark said 
 improving profitability of u.s. operations is an extremely high priority in the company 
 colgate 's results were at the high end of the range of analysts ' forecasts 
 the scope of the improvement in the u.s. business caught some analysts by surprise 
 the company 's domestic business especially its household products division has performed poorly for years 
 analysts say the earnings improvement came from cutting costs rather than increasing sales 
 for the nine months net increased N N to $ N million or $ N a share 
 sales rose N N to $ N billion 
 the company earned $ N million or $ N a share in the year-earlier period 
 colgate 's N net income included $ N million or N cents a share from discontinued operations

 <unk> which is nearly <unk> by sam and charles <unk> of dallas said it will distribute proceeds from the sale to unit holders as a <unk> dividend as soon as possible 
 the <unk> franchise system which generates about $ N million in sales annually represented substantially all of the partnership 's assets

 the company said it believes the suit is without merit 
 american telephone & telegraph co. unveiled a sweetened pension and <unk> program for management that it hopes will enable it to save $ N million in the next year 
 at&t also said net income rose N N in the third quarter 
 at&t said its amended pension program will nearly double to N the number of managers eligible to retire with immediate pension payments 
 at&t said that based on studies of other companies that have offered retirement plans it expects about one-third of its eligible managers to retire under the new program 
 at&t said third-quarter net income grew despite stiff competition in all of the company 's markets 
 net income rose to $ N million or N cents a share from the year-earlier $ N million or N cents a share 
 revenue edged up to $ N billion from $ N billion 
 the latest period 's net was reduced $ N million or nine cents a share for a change in depreciation method and <unk> changes in estimates of <unk> lives and net salvage for certain telecommunications equipment 
 the results roughly matched estimates of securities analysts who were encouraged by at&t increasing its operating margin to N N from N N a year ago because of continued cost-cutting efforts 
 sales of long-distance services an extremely competitive market rose N N 
 but the growth was partly offset by lower equipment sales and <unk> and price cuts on some products 
 under the amended pension program at&t managers who have at least five years of service will have five years added to their age and length of service for pension purposes 
 managers who retire dec. N will have an additional N N added to their monthly pension for as long as five years or age N whichever comes earlier 
 an at&t spokeswoman said the company would likely replace about one-third of its managers who choose to retire with new employees 
 analysts hailed the sweetened pension package which they said had been the subject of rumors for several months 
 this tells you at&t is serious about continuing to manage their cost structure and is committed to <unk> earnings growth said jack <unk> an analyst with painewebber inc 
 but other analysts expressed disappointment that the cost-cutting move wo n't result in even greater earnings growth 
 this is a good move but it only gets you to where people 's expectations already are in terms of earnings growth said joel d. gross an analyst with donaldson lufkin & jenrette 
 mr. gross said he had hoped that a cost savings of $ N million would result in even greater growth than the N N annual earnings increase at&t has told analysts it expects in the future 
 at&t said the special retirement option will increase fourth-quarter expenses 
 but the company said the amount ca n't be determined until it knows how many managers <unk> to retire 
 at&t said the expense increase will be largely offset by a gain from its previously announced plan to swap its holdings in <unk> c. olivetti & co. for shares in cie <unk> <unk> an italian holding company 
 for the nine months at&t said net income was $ N billion or $ N a share up N N from $ N billion or $ N a share 
 revenue gained N N to $ N billion from $ N billion

 when it comes to buying and selling shares westridge capital management inc. takes a back seat to no one 
 every dollar 's worth of stock in the los angeles money manager 's portfolio is traded seven or eight times a year the firm estimates 
 that makes it the most active trader among all the nation 's investment advisers according to securities and exchange commission filings 
 but wait a second 
 westridge capital is an index fund the type of <unk> long-term investor whose goal is to be nothing more than average 
 westridge capital 's <unk> trading reflects the changes sweeping through the previously <unk> world of indexing 
 indexing for the most part has involved simply buying and then holding stocks in the correct mix to mirror a stock market barometer such as standard & poor 's 500-stock index and match its performance 
 institutional investors have poured $ N billion into stock and bond indexing as a cheap and easy form of investment management that promises to post average market returns 
 these big investors have <unk> to indexing because relatively few active stock pickers have been able to consistently match the returns of the s&p N or other <unk> much less beat it 
 and the fees investors pay for indexing run a few pennies for each $ N of assets a fraction of the cost of active managers 
 that 's because computers do most of the work and low trading activity keeps a lid on commission costs 
 but today indexing is moving from a passive investment strategy to an increasingly active one 
 because <unk> managers are no longer satisfied with merely being average they have developed enhanced indexing strategies that are intended to outperform the market as much as three percentage points 
 indexing has been the most single successful investment concept in the last decade but the index money has been just sort of sitting there says <unk> m. lynn president of <unk> core investors inc. an <unk> based in <unk> n.y 
 now the interest is in what else can i do with that money 
 among the <unk> indexing strategies <unk> portfolios can be built around thousands of stocks or just a few dozen rather than being restricted to the s&p N companies 
 they can ignore the s&p N stocks altogether and focus on particular types of stocks such as smaller companies those paying high dividends or companies in a particular industry state or country 
 with today 's computer-driven program trading techniques index funds can trade back and forth between stock-index futures and the actual stocks making up indexes such as the s&p N 
 futures and options also make it possible to build synthetic index funds that do n't actually own a single share of stock but can produce returns that match or exceed the broad stock market 
 one reason for these <unk> is that indexing 's rapid growth is slowing particularly for those plain <unk> funds that mirror the s&p N 
 there is n't a <unk> of big investors out there still waiting to get into indexing says p. james <unk> vice president of <unk> investment management co. chicago which offers both indexing and active management services 
 after <unk> in size in the past five years index funds now hold about N N of the stock owned by pension funds 
 a further problem is <unk> profits 
 <unk> funds have become so <unk> that fees they can charge have plunged to almost nothing and in some cases are just that 
 to land customers for their <unk> stock <unk> business big banks sometimes will throw in basic indexing services for free 
 it 's like getting a free <unk> when you open an account says <unk> core 's mr. lynn 
 as a result <unk> have been looking for ways to give investors something more than the average for their money 
 and many have been successful as in the case of the index fund operated by <unk> westridge capital 
 westridge capital has used enhanced indexing techniques to beat the s&p N 's returns by N to N percentage points over the past four years with the same risk level as holding the s&p N stocks according to james <unk> the firm 's president 
 strategies vary for westridge capital which has $ N million under management 
 the firm sometimes buys s&p N futures when they are selling at a discount to the actual stocks and will switch back and forth between stocks and stock-index futures to take advantages of any <unk> price <unk> 
 mr. <unk> also goes through periods when he buys stocks in <unk> with options to boost returns and protect against declines 
 and in some months he buys stock-index futures and not stocks at all 
 by their nature our trades are very short-term and are going to create high turnover mr. <unk> adds 
 the more turnover the better for our clients 
 big <unk> bankers trust co. also uses futures in a strategy that on average has added one percentage point to its enhanced fund 's returns 
 j. thomas allen president of <unk> advanced investment management inc. agrees it 's a good idea to jump between the s&p N stocks and futures 
 you 're buying the s&p and you always want to hold the cheapest form of it he says 
 but some <unk> make little or no use of futures saying that these instruments present added risks for investors 
 if the futures markets have a problem then those products could have a problem says john <unk> managing director of prudential insurance co. of america 's investment index technologies inc. unit 
 prudential currently is seeking approval to offer a new fund offering a return equal to the s&p N index plus N of a percentage point 
 an added feature is that the <unk> improved return would be guaranteed by prudential 
 there are many other strategies to bolster the returns of index funds 
 they include 
 limited risk funds 
 these guarantee protection against stock market declines while still passing along most gains 
 here a fund may promise to pay back say $ N of every $ N invested for a year even if the market goes much lower 
 the fund could invest $ N for one year in treasury bills yielding N N to return the guaranteed $ N 
 that leaves $ N which could be used to buy s&p N options that will nearly match any gain in the s&p index 
 manager <unk> funds 
 say a big investor is interested in growth stocks 
 instead of hiring one of the many active managers specializing in growth stocks <unk> can design a portfolio around the same stocks the portfolio will be maintained by computer reducing both fees and in theory risk because of the large number of stocks 
 we see a lot of interest in those kind of things says frank <unk> a vice president of bankers trust 
 people comfortable with the passive approach are using them for other strategies 
 tilt funds 
 this is an index fund with a bet 
 instead of <unk> the s&p N or some other index exactly some stocks are <unk> or <unk> in the portfolio 
 one simple approach is to exclude s&p N companies considered bankruptcy candidates this can avoid weak <unk> but also can hurt when a company like chrysler corp. <unk> 
 another approach an investor with $ N million might use $ N million to buy the s&p N index and spend the other $ N million on a favorite group of stocks 
 specialized funds 
 indexes can be constructed to serve social goals such as eliminating the stocks of companies doing business in south africa 
 other funds have been designed to concentrate on stocks in a geographic area in order to encourage local investment 
 pennsylvania state employees retirement system for example has about $ N million invested in a fund of N companies that are either <unk> or have N N of their work forces in the state 
 short interest on the new york stock exchange declined for the second consecutive month this time N N while the american stock exchange reported its third consecutive record month of short interest 
 the big board reported that short interest dropped to N shares as of oct. N from N shares in <unk> 
 amex short interest climbed N N to N shares from N shares 
 for the year-earlier month the big board reported N shares indicating a N N year-to-year rise while the amex reported N shares a N N leap 
 amex short interest has been heading upward since <unk> with increases in each month since then except at <unk> 
 traders who sell short borrow stock and sell it betting that the stock 's price will decline and that they can buy the shares back later at a lower price for return to the lender 
 short interest is the number of shares that have n't yet been purchased for return to lenders 
 although a substantial short position reflects heavy speculation that a stock 's price will decline some investors consider an increase in short interest bullish because the borrowed shares eventually must be bought back 
 <unk> in short interest of certain stocks also may be caused partly by <unk> 
 the figures occasionally include incomplete transactions in restricted stock 
 the level of negative sentiment measured by the big board short interest ratio slipped to N from last month 's N 
 the ratio is the number of trading days at the exchange 's average trading volume that would be required to convert the total short interest position 
 some analysts suggest however that the ratio has weakened in value as an indicator because options and other products can be used to hedge short positions 
 <unk> corp. led the big board list of largest short volumes with N shares 
 <unk> has proposed to acquire <unk> corp. consisting of the auto parts division and some debt of <unk> corp. for $ N million of cash and securities 
 chemical waste management posted the biggest increase in short volume on the new york exchange up N shares to N

 transcanada pipelines ltd. led the percentage decliners dropping to N shares from N 
 the amex short interest volume leader again was texas air corp. rising to N shares from N 
 <unk> pharmaceutical co. posted the largest volume increase N shares to N 
 the company is under an investigation concerning procedures to gain food and drug administration approval of generic drugs 
 <unk> has denied any wrongdoing

 the company is facing a takeover proposal from the financier sir james goldsmith

 your oct. N editorial <unk> <unk> presidency <unk> states that i was critical of the bush administration 's failure to have any plan in place to respond in a timely fashion to the opportunities to oust manuel noriega presented by the attempted military coup on oct. N 
 you are absolutely wrong however in <unk> that this position is some kind of <unk> something newly arrived at as a result of reading the opinion polls 
 my position is one founded on both the facts and the law 
 although you may have forgotten public opinion about gen. noriega is where it is in large measure because of my investigation of his years of involvement in narcotics <unk> and simultaneous work as a u.s. <unk> 
 the public made up its mind about gen. noriega largely as a result of the hearings i <unk> in the subcommittee on terrorism and narcotics of the foreign relations committee on feb. N N N and N N and again on april N N 
 it was during those hearings that the nation first learned the <unk> and <unk> of gen. noriega 's <unk> and of his <unk> relationships with a variety of u.s. government agencies 
 those hearings also <unk> how gen. noriega was able to use his relationships with these agencies to delay u.s. action against him and to exploit the administration 's <unk> with <unk> the sandinistas to protect his own <unk> 
 as former ambassador to costa rica francis j. <unk> testified before the subcommittee the reagan administration knew that gen. noriega was involved with narcotics but made a decision in the summer of N to put gen. noriega on the shelf until nicaragua was settled 
 as the report issued by the subcommittee concluded our government did nothing regarding gen. noriega 's drug business and substantial criminal involvement because the first priority was the contra war 
 this decision resulted in at least some drugs entering the united states as a hidden cost of the war 
 unfortunately this problem continued even after gen. noriega 's indictment 
 throughout N and this year i and others in congress have pressed the u.s. to develop a plan for pushing this <unk> out of panama

 for vietnamese these are tricky often <unk> times 
 after years of <unk> economic and political reform was embraced at the end of N but ringing <unk> have yet to be translated into much action 
 vietnam is finding that turning a <unk> socialist order into a dynamic free market does n't come easy 
 here is how three vietnamese are coping with change 
 the tire king 
 nguyen van chan is living proof that old ways die hard 
 mr. chan used to be an <unk> in <unk> a private entrepreneur 
 his business success made him an official target in <unk> days 
 mr. chan now N years old invented a <unk> <unk> he and his family produced from plastic waste 
 later he marketed <unk> 
 both products were <unk> popular 
 for his troubles mr. chan was jailed three times between N and N 
 though his operation was registered and used only scrap he was accused of conducting illegal business and <unk> illegal materials 
 once he was held for three months without being charged 
 things were supposed to change when vietnam 's economic reforms gathered pace and for <unk> they did 
 after years of <unk> mr. chan produced a <unk> bicycle tire that <unk> its <unk> rival 
 by N he was selling thousands of tires 
 newspapers published articles about him and he was hailed as the tire king 
 his efforts earned a gold <unk> at a national exhibition and attracted renewed attention from local authorities 
 district police in N <unk> on his suburban home which he and his large family used as both residence and factory and demanded proof the house and equipment were his 
 he produced it 
 that was the first time they lost and i won he says 
 he was further questioned to determine if he was a real working man or an <unk> 
 says mr. chan when i showed it was from my own brain they lost for the second time 
 but a few days later the police accused him of stealing electricity acquiring rubber without permission and buying stolen property 
 warned he was to be jailed again he fled to the <unk> 
 his family was given three hours to leave before the house and <unk> were confiscated 
 with only the clothes they were wearing family members moved to a home owned by one of mr. chan 's sons 
 after six months on the run mr. chan learned the order for his arrest had been canceled 
 he <unk> his family in january N and began the long struggle for justice pressing everyone from <unk> municipal officials to national assembly deputies for restoration of his rights 
 he and his family kept afloat by <unk> <unk> selling fruit and doing odd jobs 
 mr. chan achieved a <unk> in N and became a minor celebrity again when his story was published in a weekly newspaper 
 in N N months after the sixth congress formally endorsed <unk> private enterprise district authorities allowed mr. chan to resume work 
 by late last year he was invited back as the tire king to display his products at a national exhibition 
 national leaders stopped by his stand to <unk> his <unk> 
 mr. chan now produces N bicycle and <unk> tires a month and N <unk> of <unk> <unk> in the son 's small house 
 <unk> people pack the house 's two rooms the <unk> four of their N children with spouses and eight of N <unk> 
 most sleep on the floor 
 come <unk> eight family members and two other workers <unk> a sheet of raw rubber that covers the floor of the house and <unk> out onto the street 
 the <unk> operations also burst out the back door into a small <unk> where an ancient press <unk> rubber solution into a flat strip and newly made tires are cooled in a <unk> filled with water 
 mr. chan talks <unk> of expanding maybe even moving into the <unk> field 
 first however he has <unk> business 
 when district authorities allowed him to resume manufacturing they released only one of his machines 
 they did n't return the rubber stocks that represent his capital 
 nor did they return his house and <unk> which he values at about $ N 
 he wants to recover more than just his property though 
 i want my dignity back he says 
 the editor 
 nguyen <unk> seemed an obvious choice when the vietnamese writers association was looking for a new editor to reform its weekly newspaper van <unk> 
 after the sixth congress journalists seized the opportunity provided by the <unk> to probe previously <unk> subjects 
 mr. <unk> N years old had solid <unk> credentials he had lost his official position in the association in he early 1980s because he questioned the <unk> of politics into literature 
 appointed editor in chief in july N mr. <unk> rapidly turned the <unk> van <unk> into vietnam 's hottest paper 
 circulation soared as the weekly went way beyond standard literary themes to cover vietnamese society and its <unk> 
 readers were <unk> by the paper 's <unk> and <unk> by the dark side of life it uncovered 
 one article <unk> a <unk> struggle by a <unk> <unk> to prove officially he was alive 
 another described how <unk> officials in <unk> <unk> province one night <unk> through homes and confiscated rice from <unk> <unk> 
 the newspaper also ran a series of controversial short stories by nguyen <unk> <unk> a former history teacher who <unk> debate over his interpretation of vietnamese culture and took a <unk> <unk> <unk> at writers who had blocked his entry into their official association 
 van <unk> quickly made influential enemies 
 those who manage <unk> and a large number of writers reacted badly to the <unk> paper says <unk> nguyen an a literary critic 
 after months of internal <unk> mr. <unk> was fired last december 
 his dismissal triggered a furor among intellectuals that continues today 
 under mr. <unk> van <unk> protected the people instead of the government says nguyen <unk> a <unk> who is the paper 's bureau chief for southern vietnam 
 the paper reflected the truth 
 for the leadership that was too painful to bear 
 the billionaire 
 nguyen thi thi is vietnam 's entrepreneur of the 1980s 
 her challenge is to keep her fledgling empire on top in the 1990s 
 mrs. thi did n't wait for the reforms to get her start 
 she charged ahead of the government and the law to establish <unk> city food co. as the biggest rice dealer in the country 
 her success which included <unk> an urban food shortage in the early 1980s helped persuade <unk> to take the reform path 
 her story is becoming part of local <unk> 
 a <unk> revolutionary with little education who fought both the french and the <unk> <unk> regime she switched <unk> to commerce after the war 
 her <unk> were <unk> despite her background 
 as she rode over regulations only her friendship with party leaders including nguyen van <unk> then <unk> <unk> <unk> city party secretary kept her out of jail 
 following mr. <unk> 's appointment as <unk> of the party at the sixth congress mrs. thi has become the <unk> of <unk> <unk> the vietnamese version of perestroika 
 the authorities have <unk> foreign reporters to her office to see an example of the new way of thinking 
 foreign publications have responded with articles declaring her vietnam 's <unk> woman 
 some people call me the communist billionaire she has told visitors 
 actually <unk> mrs. thi is about as poor as almost everyone else in this <unk> land 
 she has indeed turned <unk> city food into a <unk> conglomerate but the company itself remains state-owned

 the revenue will be regained in the current period he added 
 there are no plans to <unk> a common stock dividend mr. johnson said explaining that the board continues to believe shareholders are best served by <unk> excess cash 
 mr. johnson said the first-quarter loss also heavily reflected a rapid change in graphics technology that left <unk> channels with too many of the old computer graphics boards and too few new monitors compatible with the new graphics boards 
 western digital does n't make the monitors 
 an accelerating move by personal computer manufacturers ' to include advanced graphics <unk> as standard equipment further <unk> <unk> purchases of western digital 's equipment

 domestic lending for real estate and property development was the source of bank bumiputra malaysia <unk> 's most recent spate of financial troubles the institution 's executive chairman <unk> basir <unk> said 
 speaking to reporters this week after bank bumiputra 's shareholders approved a rescue plan <unk> sri basir said heavy lending to the property sector rocked the bank when property prices in malaysia plummeted in N 
 he said the bank could n't wait any longer for prices to recover and for borrowers to service their loans 
 so the bank 's board decided to make N billion <unk> dollars us$ N million in provisions for interest payments from loans previously recorded as revenue but never actually received by the bank and to submit a bailout package to <unk> the bank 's <unk> capital 
 the <unk> he added was similar to the hong kong N <unk> collapse which exposed the involvement of bank bumiputra 's former subsidiary in the colony in the largest banking scandal in malaysia 's history 
 the subsidiary bumiputra malaysia finance ltd. was left with m$ N billion in bad loans made to hong kong property speculators

 now she leads a <unk> abortion-rights campaign in <unk> county for pro-choice democratic gubernatorial candidate james florio 
 this is one where i cross party lines she says rejecting the anti-abortion stance of rep. florio 's opponent <unk> rep. james courter 
 people my age thought it was n't going to be an issue 
 now it has especially for people my age 
 polls bear out this warning but after a decade of increased republican influence here the new politics of abortion have contributed to a world turned upside down for mr. courter 
 unless he closes the gap republicans risk losing not only the <unk> but also the assembly next month 
 going into the 1990s the gop is paying a price for the same conservative social agenda that it used to <unk> democrats in the past 
 this change comes less from a shift in public opinion which has n't changed much on abortion over the past decade than in the <unk> of the debate 
 new jersey 's own highest court remains a liberal <unk> against major restrictions on abortion but the u.s. supreme court ruling webster vs. missouri has engaged voters across the nation who had been <unk> from the issue 
 before july pro-choice voters could <unk> make political decisions without focusing narrowly on abortion 
 now the threat of further restrictions adds a new <unk> bringing an <unk> in political activity by abortion-rights forces 
 a recent pro-choice rally in <unk> drew thousands and in a major reversal congress is <unk> a presidential veto and demanding that medicaid abortions be permitted in cases of rape and incest 
 if webster had n't happened you would n't be here linda <unk> tells a reporter in the <unk> office of the national organization for women 
 we could have shouted from the <unk> about courter and no one would have heard us 
 new jersey is a proving ground for this aggressive <unk> movement this year

 a matching <unk> star <unk> poll last month showed a complete reversal 
 voters in the same age group backed democrat florio N N to N N over republican courter 
 abortion alone ca n't explain this shift but new jersey is a model of how so personal an issue can become a baseline of sorts in judging a candidate 
 by a <unk> ratio voters appear more at ease with mr. florio 's stance on abortion and polls indicate his lead widens when the candidates are specifically linked to the issue 
 the times are my times says mr. florio 
 the <unk> county congressman still carries himself with a trademark <unk> intensity but at a <unk> in newark 's columbus day parade recently he was <unk> with his wife in the middle of the avenue in the city 's old <unk> ward 
 after losing by fewer than N votes in the N governor 's race he has prepared himself <unk> for this moment including deciding in recent years he could no longer support curbs on federal funding for medicaid abortions 
 if you 're going to be consistent and say it is a <unk> protected right he asks how are you going to say an upscale woman who can drive to the hospital or clinic in a nice car has a constitutional right and someone who is not in great shape financially does not 
 mr. courter by comparison seems a shadow of the confident <unk> who defended oliver north before national cameras at iran-contra hearings two years ago 
 looking back he says he <unk> by <unk> his personal opposition to abortion instead of <unk> voters that he would n't impose his views on policy as governor 
 it is a <unk> that <unk> neither side in the debate 
 he does n't know himself <unk> <unk> of the abortion rights league says of mr. courter 's position 
 even abortion opponents however angry with mr. florio ca n't hide their frustration with the republican 's <unk> 
 he does n't want to lead the people says richard <unk> president of new jersey right to life 
 moreover by stepping outside the state 's pro-choice tradition mr. courter <unk> fears that he is too conservative as well on more pressing concerns such as auto insurance rates and the environment 
 he hurt himself further this summer by bringing homosexual issues into the debate and by <unk> on this issue and abortion he has weakened his credibility in what is already a <unk> campaign on both sides 
 elected to congress in N the <unk> mr. courter is part of a generation of young conservatives who were once very much in the lead of the <unk> shift under mr. reagan 
 like many of his colleagues he did n't serve in vietnam in the 1960s yet embraced a <unk> defense and foreign policy even voting against a N resolution critical of the u.s. mining of nicaraguan harbors 
 jack kemp and the writers irving <unk> and george <unk> were influences and mr. courter 's own conservative credentials proved useful to the current new jersey gop governor thomas kean in the N republican primary here 
 the same partnership is now crucial to mr. courter 's fortunes but the abortion issue is only a reminder of the gap between his record and that of the more moderate pro-choice gov. kean 
 while the warren county congressman pursued an <unk> <unk> agenda in washington gov. kean was <unk> increased income and sales taxes at home and overseeing a near doubling in the size of new jersey 's budget in his eight years in office 
 kean forces play down any differences with mr. courter but this history makes it harder for the conservative to run against government 
 mr. courter 's free-market plan to bring down auto insurance rates met criticism from gov. kean 's own insurance commissioner 
 mr. courter is further <unk> by a record of votes opposed to government regulation on behalf of consumers 
 <unk> in spanish from his days in the peace corps mr. courter actively courts minority voters but seems oddly over his head

 consumer prices rose a surprisingly moderate N N in september pushed up mostly by a jump in clothing costs the labor department reported 
 energy costs which drove wholesale prices up sharply during the month continued to decline at the retail level pulling down transportation and helping to ease housing costs 
 the report was the <unk> news the financial markets had seen since before the stock market plunged more than N points last friday 
 the dow jones industrial average rallied on the news closing N points higher at N 
 bond prices also jumped as traders appeared to read the data as a sign that interest rates may fall

 we 've had <unk> declines in consumer energy prices in each of the past three months and at the wholesale level those are fully behind us now said jay <unk> chief domestic economist at bankers trust co. in new york 
 because wholesale energy prices shot up by a steep N N last month many analysts expected energy prices to rise at the consumer level too 
 as a result many economists were expecting the consumer price index to increase significantly more than it did 
 but retail energy prices declined N N in september 
 though analysts say competition will probably hold down increases in retail energy prices many expect some of the wholesale rise to be passed along to the consumer before the end of the year 
 still some analysts insisted that the worst of the inflation is behind 
 it increasingly appears that N was a temporary inflation <unk> and not the beginning of a cyclical inflation problem argued edward <unk> chief economist at prudential-bache securities inc. in new york 
 in both N and N consumer prices rose N N 
 a <unk> in world oil prices last winter sent consumer prices soaring at a N N annual rate in the first five months of this year but the subsequent decline in energy prices has pulled the annual rate back down to N N 
 mr. <unk> predicted that world business competition will continue to restrain prices 
 the bottom line is it seems to me that the economic environment has become very very <unk> for a lot of businesses he said 
 back in N business was operating at fairly tight capacity so businesses felt they could raise prices 
 now he said a slowdown in economic activity has <unk> demand 
 the mild inflation figures renewed investors ' hopes that the federal reserve will ease its interest-rate stance 
 the steep climb in producer prices reported last friday <unk> <unk> about lower interest rates and contributed to the stock market 's N N plunge that day 
 in the past several days however the u.s. 's central bank has allowed a key interest rate to fall slightly to try to stabilize the markets 
 analysts say fed policy makers have been wary of <unk> credit too much because they were still uncertain about the level of inflation in the economy 
 excluding the volatile categories of energy and food leaving what some economists call the core inflation rate consumer prices still rose only N N in september 
 transportation costs actually fell N N and housing costs gained only N N 
 apparel prices <unk> up N N but that was after three months of declines 
 medical costs continued their steep <unk> rising N N after four consecutive months of N N increases 
 car prices another area that contributed to the steep rise in the wholesale index last month still showed declines at the consumer level 
 they dropped N N as dealers continued to offer rebates to attract customers 
 food prices rose N N for the second month in a row far slower than the monthly rises earlier in the year

 most people think if you slip you 'll wind up in a body cast 
 the ad campaign represents an unusual spirit of cooperation among resorts and ski equipment makers normally they only run ads <unk> their own products and facilities 
 but in these crunch times for the ski industry some resorts such as the <unk> fire red river and <unk> ski areas in new mexico have even started <unk> skiers to each other 's <unk> and next year plan to sell tickets good for all local <unk> 
 many resorts also are focusing more on the service side of their business 
 since N N of skiers are parents many <unk> are building <unk> expanding ski schools and adding entertainment for kids 
 <unk> colo. now has a <unk> that looks like an old mining town kids can ski through and pan for fool 's gold 
 for $ N they can enjoy their own <unk> entertainment with dinner without mom and <unk> 
 a few years ago parents usually had to hire a <unk> or take turns skiing while one spouse stayed with the children 
 most parents who had to go through that never came back says michael shannon president of <unk> associates inc. which owns and operates the <unk> and nearby <unk> creek resorts 
 to make skiing more convenient for <unk> visitors several resorts are buying or starting their own travel agencies 
 in one phone call ski <unk> can make hotel and restaurant reservations buy lift tickets rent ski equipment and sign up for <unk> 
 and resorts are adding other <unk> such as <unk> restaurants health <unk> and vacation packages with a twist 
 during winter carnival week for example visitors at sunday river in maine can take a <unk> balloon ride 
 people these days want something else to do besides ski and sit in the bar says don <unk> executive director of <unk> fire n.m. 's chamber of commerce 
 the ski industry hopes to increase the number of skiers by N million to about N million in the next five years with its latest ads and promotions 
 but some think that 's being overly optimistic 
 for one thing it may be tough to attract people because skiing is still expensive a lift ticket can cost up to $ N a day and equipment prices are rising 
 and most <unk> still prefer a warm climate for their winter <unk> 
 an american express co. survey of its travel agents revealed that only N N believe their clients will pick a trip this winter based on the availability of winter sports as opposed to N N who think that <unk> sports will be the deciding factor 
 even if they could bring in that many new skiers i do n't know if the industry could handle that kind of an increase says i. william berry editor and publisher of the ski industry letter in <unk> n.y 
 most people will come on the weekend the <unk> will be <unk> and then these new skiers wo n't come back 
 they did n't play the third game of the world series on tuesday night as scheduled and they did n't play it on wednesday or thursday either 
 but you knew that did n't you 
 they are supposed to play the game next tuesday in candlestick park here 
 the theory is that the stadium damaged by tuesday 's earthquake will be repaired by then and that people will be able to get there 
 like just about everything else that remains to be seen 
 aftershocks could intervene 
 but at least the law of averages should have swung to the favorable side 
 it may seem <unk> to worry about the world series amid the destruction to the bay area <unk> by tuesday 's quake but the name of this column is on sports so i feel obliged to do so 
 you might be interested to know that baseball not survival appeared to be the first thought of most of the crowd of <unk> that had gathered at candlestick at N p.m. tuesday a half-hour before game time when the quake struck 
 as soon as the tremor passed many people <unk> arose and cheered as though it had been a novel kind of <unk> show 
 one fan <unk> several rows in front of the open <unk> <unk> press section where i was <unk> faced the assembled <unk> and <unk> shouted we arranged that just for you guys 
 i thought and i 'm sure others did you should n't have bothered 
 i 'd <unk> through my only previous <unk> with natural disaster a <unk> N or so <unk> ago near <unk> city mich. so i was <unk> for one reaction to such things the urge to talk about them 
 perhaps <unk> by the daily diet of radio and tv reporters <unk> <unk> into people 's faces and asking how they feel about one <unk> or another fellow reporters and <unk> who <unk> my press <unk> were eager to <unk> 
 it felt like i was on a station platform and a train went by said one man describing my own reaction 
 a women said she saw the park 's light standards <unk> 
 a man said he saw the upper <unk> <unk> 
 i saw neither 
 <unk> of good sense to the contrary not <unk> the general <unk> was to believe that the <unk> would be brief and that ball would be played 
 i was near the top of the stadium and saw a steel <unk> <unk> six feet from where i sat but i stayed put for N or N minutes confessed a friend 
 i guess i thought this is the world series and i 'm not <unk> <unk> <unk> out 
 here in the global village though folks do not stay <unk> for long 
 electrical power was out in <unk> candlestick park but <unk> <unk> and television sets were <unk> 
 within a few minutes the true extent of the catastrophe was becoming clear 
 its richter scale measurement was reported as N then N then N 
 a section of the bay bridge had collapsed as had a part of interstate highway N in oakland 
 people had died 
 at N p.m. scheduled game time having passed some fans <unk> let 's play ball 
 no longer innocent they qualified as <unk> 
 the stadium was ordered <unk> soon afterward the announcement made over police <unk> cited the power <unk> but it later was revealed that there also had been damage of the sort reported by my friend 
 outside i spotted two young men <unk> blocks of concrete 
 pieces of candlestick they said 
 the crowd remained good <unk> even <unk> 
 tv reporters interviewed fans in the parking lots while a few feet away others watched the interviews on their portable tvs 
 the only frenzy i saw was commercial <unk> selling world series <unk> <unk> and dated <unk> were besieged by fledgling speculators who saw future profit in the items 
 the traffic <unk> out of the park was <unk> 
 it took me a half-hour to move N feet from my parking spot in an outer lot to an <unk> and an additional hour to reach an inner roadway a <unk> away 
 the <unk> trip to my airport hotel that had taken N minutes earlier in the day took more than three hours 
 at my hotel the <unk> power was out some interior <unk> had broken loose and there had been water damage but little else 
 with <unk> <unk> a hotel across the street the <unk> had been hit harder a large sheet of its concrete <unk> and several window <unk> were torn away 
 the <unk> staff had <unk> set out <unk> <unk> in the <unk> prepared a <unk> buffet and passed around <unk> and <unk> 
 i fell <unk> on the lobby floor next to a man wearing a chicago cubs <unk> 
 i expected him to say i told you so but he already was <unk> 
 the <unk> consensus was that the earthquake made the world series seem <unk> 
 my response was that sports rarely are important only <unk> and the quake merely <unk> that fact 
 should the rest of the series be played at all 
 sure 
 the quake and baseball were n't related unlike the massacre of athletes that attended the N olympics 
 that heavily <unk> event learned nothing from the <unk> experience and seems doomed to repeat it 
 two <unk> <unk> 
 this has been widely dubbed the bart series after the local subway line and the bay bridge series 
 flags fly at <unk> for the death of bart <unk> the late baseball commissioner and now the bay bridge lies in <unk> 
 a series that was shaping up as the <unk> since the <unk> <unk> diego go of N has become <unk> in the least <unk> way 
 still its edge is lost 
 it now will be played mostly for the record and should be <unk> up as quickly as possible without off days 
 and i will never again complain about a <unk> 
 the disarray in the junk-bond market that began last month with a credit crunch at campeau corp. has offered commercial banks a golden opportunity to play a greater role in financing billion-dollar takeovers 
 but two big new york banks seem to have kicked those chances away for the moment with the embarrassing failure of citicorp and chase manhattan corp. to deliver $ N billion in bank financing for a leveraged buy-out of united airlines parent ual corp 
 for more than a decade banks have been pressing congress and banking regulators for expanded powers to act like securities firms in playing wall street 's lucrative takeover game from giving mergers advice all the way to selling and trading high-yield junk bonds 
 those expanded powers reached their zenith in july when bankers trust new york corp. provided mergers advice an equity investment and bank loans for the $ N billion leveraged buy-out of northwest airlines parent nwa inc 
 one of the major selling points used by los angeles financier alfred <unk> in getting the takeover approved was that the deal did n't include any junk bonds 
 that was seen as an advantage in lobbying airline employees and washington regulators for approval of the contested takeover 
 all $ N billion in debt for the deal was supplied by banks 
 charles nathan <unk> of mergers and acquisitions at salomon brothers inc. says it is natural for banks to try to expand beyond their bread-and-butter business of providing senior debt for buy-outs 
 but the ual collapse he says may tell you it 's not going to work that easily 
 david <unk> a mergers adviser in la jolla calif. who aided los angeles investor marvin davis on the bids which put both ual and nwa in play as takeover candidates this year says that banks have been preparing to play a larger and larger role in acquisition financing 
 mr. <unk> says that in the past banks would normally have <unk> N N of a total buy-out price with the loans secured by the target company 's assets 
 another N N of the borrowed funds would come from the sale to investors of junk bonds which offer less security and typically carry higher yields than bank loans 
 mr. <unk> 's purchase of nwa mr. <unk> notes was probably the most aggressive to date with bank debt at N N of the purchase price 
 but mr. <unk> says that citicorp 's failure to deliver on its promise to raise the ual bank debt for a labor-management buy-out group is very <unk> to potential users of a <unk> letter from commercial banks 
 his client mr. davis used just such a letter from citicorp in pursuing ual citicorp later agreed to work with a competing ual buy-out group 
 executives of citicorp and chase manhattan declined to comment on either the ual situation or on the changing nature of banks ' role in financing takeovers 
 in the wake of campeau 's problems prices of junk bonds tumbled throwing into doubt the ability of corporate <unk> to finance large takeovers with the help of junk bond sales 
 mark <unk> senior managing director at manufacturers hanover trust co. says the <unk> in junk bonds may yet open new business opportunities to banks in <unk> takeovers 
 but he warns that banks will have to have enough discipline not to make loans that are too risky 
 in fact manufacturers hanover said in its third-quarter earnings report that fees from <unk> loans to other banks dropped N N to $ N million 
 we did n't take part in a lot of deals because their credit quality was poor says a bank spokesman 
 james b. lee head of <unk> and private <unk> at chemical banking corp. said he believes banks can still make a credible offer of <unk> shopping for takeover finance 
 as evidence he cites yesterday 's arrangement for the final financing of a $ N billion bid for american medical international inc. in which chemical served as both the lead bank and an equity investor 
 beyond the current weakness in the junk bond market banks have another advantage over investment banks in financing contested takeovers 
 arthur <unk> jr. a takeover lawyer at fried frank harris <unk> & jacobson notes that a political and emotional bias has developed against junk bonds 
 one hostile bidder who deliberately avoided using junk bonds was paramount communications inc. in its initial offer to acquire time inc. for $ N billion or $ N a share 
 a paramount spokesman says that decision was based on the financial not political <unk> of junk bonds 
 but some observers believe paramount chairman martin davis wanted to avoid the possible <unk> of being perceived as a corporate raider in his controversial bid for time 
 in the end mr. davis used junk bonds so that he could raise paramount 's bid to $ N a share 
 some <unk> <unk> said the initial lower bid without junk bonds was a factor in his losing the company 
 time <unk> paramount by acquiring warner communications inc 
 the success of the nwa financing and the failure of the ual deal also seem to highlight the important new role in takeover financing being played by japanese banks 
 japanese banks accounted for N N of the nwa bank debt according to a report by transportation secretary samuel skinner 
 but it was <unk> rejection by japanese banks that helped seal the fate of the attempt to buy ual 
 citicorp and chase are attempting to put together a new lower bid 
 <unk> <unk> chief economist of the institute for financial affairs inc. a tokyo research center on finance and economics says the junk bond market became very jittery and there 's a fear of a coming recession and the possible bankruptcy of lbo companies 
 <unk> inc. filed suit in federal court here alleging that a group that holds N N of its stock made false deceptive and misleading statements in recent regulatory filings and public announcements 
 <unk> 's complaint claims that the group led by investor malcolm i. glazer violated securities laws by failing to disclose plans to purchase N N of the company 's shares outstanding and that when the required hart-scott-rodino filing eventually was made it did n't disclose the group 's alleged earlier violation of the so-called <unk> requirements of the law 
 mr. glazer could n't immediately be reached to comment 
 but when <unk> last week publicly questioned the <unk> of the group 's filing procedures the rochester n.y. investor said we <unk> with every law and he denied any wrongdoing 
 the glazer group said in a securities and exchange commission filing in early october that it may seek a controlling interest in <unk> or seek representation on the company 's board 
 <unk> has said it does n't intend to be acquired by the glazer group or any other party 
 inland steel industries inc. battered by lower volume and higher costs posted a N N drop in third-quarter earnings 
 the nation 's <unk> steelmaker earned $ N million or N cents a share compared with $ N million or $ N a share a year earlier when the industry was enjoying peak demand and strong pricing 
 sales fell to $ N million from $ N billion 
 the earnings also mark a significant drop from the second quarter 's $ N million or $ N a share 
 moreover the earnings were well below analysts ' expectations of about $ N a share 
 in composite trading on the new york stock exchange inland closed yesterday at $ N a share down $ N 
 the company attributed the earnings drop to lower volume related to seasonal demand and the soft consumer durable market especially in the automotive sector 
 however the company also lost orders because of prolonged labor talks in the second quarter 
 third-quarter shipments slipped N N from the year-ago period and N N from this year 's second quarter 
 profit of steel shipped for the company 's steel segment slid to $ N a ton from $ N a ton a year earlier and $ N a ton a quarter earlier 
 analysts noted that the disappointing results do n't reflect lower prices for steel products 
 charles bradford an analyst with merrill lynch capital markets said higher prices for galvanized and <unk> products offset lower prices for bar <unk> and structural steel 
 structural steel which primarily serves the construction market was especially hurt by a N N price drop mr. bradford said 
 the company said its integrated steel sector was also hurt by higher raw material repair and maintenance and labor costs 
 the increased labor costs became effective aug. N under terms of the four-year labor agreement with the united steelworkers union 
 meanwhile the company 's service center segment which saw operating profit drop to $ N million from $ N million a year ago experienced much of the same demand and cost problems as well as start-up costs associated with a <unk> processing facility in chicago and an upgraded computer information system 
 inland chairman frank w. <unk> said the company 's short-term outlook is <unk> by uncertainties in the economy and financial markets 
 however he noted that steel mill bookings are up from early summer levels and that he expects the company to improve its cost performance in the fourth quarter 
 in the first nine months profit was $ N million or $ N a share on sales of $ N billion compared with $ N million or $ N a share on sales of $ N billion a year earlier 
 the seismic activity of a financial market bears a <unk> to the seismic activity of the earth 
 when things are quiet low volatility the structures on which markets stand can be relatively inefficient and still perform their functions adequately 
 however when powerful forces start shaking the market 's structure the more <unk> it is the better its chance for survival 
 america 's financial markets do not yet have all the required modern features required to make them fully <unk> 
 investors lack equal access to the markets ' trading arena and its information 
 that structural lack is crucial because investors are the only source of market liquidity 
 and liquidity is what markets need to damp <unk> and aftershocks 
 in today 's markets specialists on the new york stock exchange and <unk> market makers in the over-the-counter market are the only market participants allowed to play a direct role in the <unk> process 
 when they halt trading all market liquidity is gone 
 and when any component of the market cash futures or options loses liquidity the price discovery system the way prices are determined becomes flawed or is lost entirely for a time 
 last friday the 13th as well as two years ago this week the markets became <unk> 
 when that happened seismic tremors of fear much like the shock waves created by an earthquake <unk> through the market and increased the market 's volatility 
 lack of important needed information can cause fear 
 fear is the father of panic 
 panic frequently results in <unk> behavior 
 and in financial markets <unk> behavior is sometimes translated into catastrophe 
 when market tremors start it is crucial that as much information about transaction prices and the <unk> curve buy and sell orders at various prices be made available to all not just to market makers 
 because of a lack of information and access many investors including the very ones whose buying power could restore stability and damp volatility are forced to stand on the sidelines when they are most needed because of their ignorance of important market information 
 to add <unk> power to america 's markets a modern electronic trading system should be implemented that permits equal access to the trading arena and the information that would automatically <unk> such access by investors particularly institutional investors 
 contrary to some opinions the trading activities of specialists and other market makers do not provide liquidity to the market as a whole 
 what market makers provide is <unk> a very valuable service 
 liquidity is not a service 
 it is a market attribute the ability to absorb selling orders without causing significant price changes in the absence of news 
 market makers buy what investors wish to sell their business is <unk> these unwanted positions as quickly as possible to other investors and at a profit 
 as a result while any one customer may purchase <unk> by selling to a market maker which is <unk> for the investor the market as a whole remains in the same circumstances it was before the transaction the unwanted position is still an unwanted position only the identity of the seller has changed 
 in fact it can be argued that increasing capital commitments by market makers a result of some <unk> crash studies also increases market volatility since the more securities are held by market makers at any given time the more selling pressure is <unk> the market 
 in an open electronic system any investor <unk> to pay for <unk> access to the trading arena through a registered broker-dealer would be able to see the entire <unk> curve buy and sell orders at each price entered by dealers and investors alike and to enter and execute orders 
 current quotations would reflect the combined financial judgment of all market participants not just those of <unk> who become extremely <unk> during times of crisis 
 investors and professionals alike would compete on the level playing field congress sought and called a national market system not yet achieved almost N years ago when it passed the securities reform act of N 
 last friday 's market gyrations did not result in severe aftershocks 
 were we smart or just lucky 
 i 'm not certain 
 but i am sure we need to maximize our earthquake protection by making certain that our market structures let investors add their mighty <unk> power to our nation 's markets 
 mr. <unk> is chairman of his own consulting company in <unk> n.j 
 now you see it now you do n't 
 the recession that is 
 the economy 's <unk> steps leave investors wondering whether things are slowing down or speeding up 
 so often are government statistics revised that they seem to resemble a <unk> weather <unk> 
 for the past seven years investors have had the wind at their backs in the form of a generally growing economy 
 some may have forgotten and some younger ones may never have experienced what it 's like to invest during a recession 
 different tactics are called for as losing money becomes easier and making money becomes tougher 
 for those investors who believe or fear that N will be a recession year many economists and money managers agree on steps that can be taken to lower the risks in a portfolio 
 in a <unk> pros advise investors who expect a slowdown to hold fewer stocks than usual and to favor shares of big companies in defensive industries 
 a heavy <unk> of cash is prescribed along with a <unk> <unk> to bonds <unk> government bonds 
 it 's <unk> to think these defensive steps can be delayed until a recession is clearly at hand 
 but that may not be possible because recessions often take investors by surprise 
 they always seem to come a bit later than you expect 
 when they do hit they hit fast says david a. wyss chief financial economist at the data resources division of mcgraw-hill inc 
 though he himself does n't expect a recession soon mr. wyss advises people who do that the best thing to be in is long that is 20-year to 30-year treasury bonds 
 the reason is simple mr. wyss says interest rates almost always decline during recession 
 as surely as a <unk> <unk> falling interest rates force up the price of previously issued bonds 
 they are worth more because they pay higher interest than newly issued bonds do 
 that effect holds true for both short-term and long-term bonds 
 but short-term bonds ca n't rise too much because everyone knows they will be redeemed at a <unk> price fairly soon 
 long-term bonds with many years left before maturity swing more widely in price 
 but not just any bonds will do 
 corporate bonds are usually not a good bet in a recession mr. wyss says 
 as times get tougher investors <unk> about whether companies will have enough money to pay their debts 
 this <unk> the price of corporate bonds 
 also he notes most corporate bonds are callable 
 that means that a corporation after a specified amount of time has passed can buy back its bonds by paying investors the face value plus in some cases a <unk> 
 when interest rates have dropped it makes sense for corporations to do just that they then save on interest costs 
 but the investors are left <unk> with money to reinvest at a time when interest rates are <unk> 
 if corporate bonds are bad in recessions junk bonds are likely to be the worst of all 
 it 's an <unk> necessity to get out of junk bonds when a recession is in the <unk> says <unk> <unk> professor of finance at cornell university 
 such bonds are very sensitive to the downside and this could be a disaster 
 municipal bonds are generally a bit safer than corporate bonds in a recession but not as safe as bonds issued by the federal government 
 during an economic slump local tax revenues often go down raising the risks associated with at least some municipals 
 and like <unk> many municipal bonds are callable 
 but a few experts going against the consensus do n't think bonds would help investors even if a recession is in the <unk> 
 one of these is jeffrey l. beach director of research for <unk> <unk> & co. a brokerage house in houston who thinks that we 're either in a recession or about to go into one 
 what 's more he thinks this could be a <unk> recession than usual once the downturn comes it 's going to be very hard to reverse 
 investors he advises should be cautious holding fewer stocks than usual and also <unk> bonds 
 because he sees a N N to N N base rate of inflation in the economy he doubts that interest rates will fall much any time soon 
 instead mr. beach says investors probably should be carrying a very high level of cash by which he means such so-called cash equivalents as money-market funds and treasury bills 
 <unk> <unk> president of <unk> financial inc. in <unk> pa. also recommends that investors go heavily for cash 
 he is n't sure a recession is coming but says the other likely alternative <unk> inflation is just as bad 
 this late in an expansion the economy tends to <unk> off either into damaging inflation or into a recession mr. <unk> says 
 the federal reserve board 's plan for a soft landing he says requires the fed to <unk> an <unk> <unk> 
 a soft landing is n't something that can be achieved once and for all mr. <unk> adds 
 it has to be engineered over and over again month after month 
 he believes that the task facing fed chairman alan greenspan is so difficult that it resembles <unk> a <unk> <unk> and a <unk> saw 
 and in a sense that 's the kind of task individuals face in deciding what to do about stocks the mainstay of most serious investors ' portfolios 
 it comes down to a question of whether to try to time the market 
 for people who can ride out market waves through good times and bad stocks have been rewarding long-term investments 
 most studies show that <unk> investors historically have earned an annual return from stocks of N N to N N including both dividends and price appreciation 
 that 's well above what bonds or bank certificates have paid 
 moreover because no one knows for sure just when a recession is coming some analysts think investors should n't even worry too much about timing 
 trying to time the economy is a mistake says david katz chief investment officer of value <unk> management inc. in new york 
 mr. katz notes that some economists have been predicting a recession for at least two years 
 investors who <unk> and <unk> up on stocks have just hurt themselves he says 
 mr. katz adds that people who jump in and out of the stock market need to be right about N N of the time to beat a <unk> strategy 
 frequent trading runs up high commission costs 
 and the <unk> might miss the sudden <unk> that account for much of the stock market 's gains over time 
 still few investors are able to sit tight when they are convinced a recession is coming 
 after all in all five recessions since N stocks declined 
 according to <unk> davis president of <unk> davis research inc. in <unk> fla. the average drop in the dow jones industrial average was about N N and the decrease began an average of six months before a recession officially started 
 by the time a recession is official two consecutive quarters of declining gross national product much of the damage to stocks has already been done and in the typical case the recession is already half over 
 about six months before a recession ends stocks typically begin to rise again as investors anticipate a recovery 
 the average recession lasts about a year 
 unfortunately though recessions vary enough in length so that the average ca n't <unk> be used to guide investors in timing stock sales or purchases 
 but whatever their advice about timing none of these experts recommend <unk> stocks entirely during a recession 
 for the portion of an investor 's portfolio that stays in stocks professionals have a number of suggestions 
 mr. katz advocates issues with low price-earnings ratios that is low prices in <unk> to the company 's earnings per share 
 low <unk> stocks he says <unk> outperform others during a recession or bear market 
 in good times he says they lag a bit but overall they provide superior performance 
 prof. <unk> urges investors to <unk> stocks in small companies 
 <unk> shares typically fall more than <unk> stocks in a recession he says 
 and in any case he argues stocks of small companies are almost as <unk> as they were sept. N N just before the crash 
 for example mr. <unk> says stocks of small companies are selling for about N times cash flow 
 cash flow basically earnings plus depreciation is one common gauge of a company 's financial health 
 that ratio is <unk> close to the ratio of N that prevailed before the N stock-market crash mr. <unk> says 
 and it 's way above the ratio N times cash flow that bigger companies are selling for 
 another major <unk> in making a portfolio <unk> is choosing stocks in defensive industries 
 food tobacco drugs and utilities are the classic examples 
 recession or not people still eat smoke and take medicine when they 're sick 
 george <unk> iii editor of turnaround letter in boston offers one final tip for <unk> investors

 mr. dorfman covers investing issues from the wall street journal 's new york bureau 
 some industry groups consistently weather the storm better than others 
 the following shows the number of times these industries outperformed the standard & poor 's 500-stock index during the first six months of the past seven recessions 
 bond prices posted strong gains as investors went on a bargain hunt 
 but while the overall market improved the new-issue junk-bond market continued to count <unk> even as junk-bond prices rose 
 yesterday prudential-bache securities inc. said it postponed a $ N million senior subordinated debenture offering by york international corp 
 and donaldson lufkin & jenrette securities corp. scrambled to restructure and improve the potential returns on a $ N million debenture offering by chicago & north western acquisition corp. that was still being negotiated late last night 
 the issue by chicago & north western is one of the so-called good junk-bond offerings on the new-issue calendar 
 some analysts said the restructuring of the railroad concern 's issue shows how tough it is for underwriters to sell even the junk bonds of a company considered to be a relatively good credit risk 
 since last week 's junk-bond market debacle many new issues of high-yield high-risk corporate bonds have either been scaled back delayed or dropped 
 on wednesday drexel burnham lambert inc. had to slash the size of continental airlines ' junk-bond offering to $ N million from $ N million 
 salomon brothers inc. has delayed grand union co. 's $ N billion junk-bond offering while it <unk> the transaction 
 last week the grand union offering was sweetened to include warrants that allow bondholders to acquire common stock 
 prudential-bache said the york issue was delayed because of market conditions 
 everything is going through <unk> right now and chicago & north western is no exception said <unk> <unk> vice president high-yield research at citicorp 
 portfolio managers say <unk> like equity <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> may increasingly be required to sell junk-bond deals 
 dan baldwin managing director of high-yield investments at chancellor capital management said the chicago & north western offering was restructured in part because several large insurance buyers right now are demanding equity as part of the package 
 if you 're going to take the risk in this market you want something extra 
 mr. baldwin likes the offering 
 but several mutual-fund managers nervous about the deteriorating quality of their junk-bond portfolios and shy about buying new issues said they 're staying away from any junk security that is n't considered first rate for its class 
 while they consider the chicago & north western issue to be good they do n't view it as the best 
 to lure buyers to the chicago & north western bonds portfolio managers said donaldson lufkin sweetened the transaction by offering the bonds with a <unk> interest rate and a N N equity <unk> 
 the bonds are expected to have a N N N coupon rate 
 the equity arrangement apparently would allow bondholders to buy a total of N N of the stock of cnw corp. chicago & north western 's parent company 
 donaldson lufkin declined to comment on the restructuring 
 according to some analysts familiar with the negotiations the N N of equity would come directly from donaldson lufkin and a fund affiliated with the investment bank blackstone group which would reduce their cnw equity holdings by N N each 
 that would leave the blackstone fund with a N N stake and donaldson lufkin with N N 
 despite the problems with new issues high-yield bonds showed gains in the secondary or <unk> market 
 junk bonds ended about one-half point higher with so-called high-quality issues from rjr capital holdings corp. and <unk> gas service limited partnership rising one point 
 in the treasury market the benchmark 30-year bond rose <unk> point or $ N for each $ N face amount 
 the gain reflects fresh economic evidence that inflation is <unk> while the economy <unk> 
 that raised hopes that interest rates will continue to move lower 
 the labor department reported that consumer prices rose just N N last month slightly lower than some economists had expected 
 but there were also rumors yesterday that several japanese institutional investors were shifting their portfolios and buying long-term bonds while selling <unk> treasurys 
 short-term treasury securities ended narrowly mixed with two-year notes posting slight declines while three-year notes were slightly higher 
 yesterday the fed executed four-day matched sales a technical trading operation designed to drain reserves from the banking system 
 the move was interpreted by some economists as a sign that the fed does n't want the federal funds rate to move any lower than the N N N at which it has been <unk> around during the past week 
 the closely watched funds rate is what banks charge each other on overnight loans 
 it is considered an early signal of fed credit policy changes 
 the fact that they did four-day matched sales means they are not in a mood to ease aggressively 
 they are telling us that N N N is as low as they want to see the fed funds rate said robert <unk> at <unk> bank plc 
 treasury securities 
 the benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late at a price of N N to yield N N compared with N N to yield N N wednesday 
 the latest 10-year notes were quoted late at N N to yield N N compared with N N to yield N N 
 short-term rates rose yesterday 
 the discount rate on three-month treasury bills rose to N N from N N wednesday while the rate on six-month bills rose to N N from N N 
 meanwhile the treasury sold $ N billion of 52-week bills yesterday 
 the average yield on the bills was N N down from N N at the previous 52-week bill auction sept. N 
 yesterday 's yield was the lowest since N N on july N 
 here are details of the auction 
 rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value 
 thus higher bidding narrows the investor 's return while lower bidding widens it 
 the percentage rates are calculated on a <unk> year while the <unk> yield is based on a <unk> year

 dealers said junk bond issues on average were up by N to N point with so-called quality issues from rjr capital holdings corp. and <unk> gas service limited partnership posting <unk> gains 
 <unk> gas service 's N N N debentures traded at N after trading around par earlier this week and rjr 's N N N subordinated debentures of N were at N N after trading at below par earlier this week 
 investment-grade bonds were unchanged 
 municipals 
 activity was brisk in the high-grade general obligation market as a series of sell lists hit the street and capped upward price movement in the sector 
 traders estimated that more than $ N million of high-grade bonds was put up for sale via <unk> lists circulated by a handful of major brokers 
 there was speculation that the supply was coming from a commercial bank 's portfolios 
 according to market participants the bonds were met with decent bids but the volume of paper left high grades in the 10-year and under maturity range unchanged to N percentage point higher in yield 
 away from the general obligation sector activity was modest

 california expects to rely on federal emergency funds and its $ N billion in general fund reserves to meet the estimated $ N million to $ N billion in damages resulting from the quake according to a state official 
 it 's also unclear precisely how the state will rebuild its reserve said <unk> katz assistant director of california 's department of finance although she noted that a bond offering for that purpose is n't anticipated 
 meanwhile new issuance was slow 
 the largest sale in the competitive arena was a $ N million issue of school financing bonds from the virginia public school authority 
 a balance of $ N million remained in late <unk> according to the lead manager 
 mortgage-backed securities 
 mortgage securities generally ended N to N point higher but lagged gains in the treasury market because of a shift in the shape of the treasury yield curve and rumored mortgage sales by thrifts 
 premium government national mortgage association securities with coupon rates of N N and higher actually declined amid concerns about increased prepayments because of a plan being considered by congress to speed the refinancing of <unk> mortgages 
 ginnie mae N N securities were down about N at N N 
 if the refinancing plan clears congress there could be fairly heavy prepayments on the premium securities hurting any investor paying much above par for them 
 in the <unk> sector a shift in the treasury yield curve resulting from the better performance of <unk> issues over <unk> securities hurt major coupons because it will become more difficult to structure new derivative securities offerings 
 ginnie mae N N securities ended at N N up N and federal home loan mortgage corp. N N securities were at N N up N 
 the ginnie mae N N issue was yielding N N to a 12-year average life assumption as the spread above the treasury 10-year note widened N percentage point to N

 the <unk> approaches makes his pitch 
 it may be <unk> he wants money for food or <unk> <unk> his sister is at this very moment near death in <unk> he has lost his <unk> and has only $ N in change to put toward a bus ticket costing $ N and wo n't you give him the difference 
 no 
 well how about a loan he 'll take your name and address 
 figuring that their money would more likely go toward a bottle of night train express most people have little trouble saying no to <unk> like this 
 but healthy skepticism <unk> when they are <unk> by an organized charity to help fight cancer <unk> child abuse or what have you 
 most see little reason to doubt that their cash will go toward these noble goals 
 but will it 
 in a <unk> number of cases no 
 in fact the <unk> sometimes might be better off giving the money to the <unk> at least he has no overhead and he might even be telling the truth 
 last year more than $ N billion was donated to the nation 's N charities 
 while the vast bulk of it was indeed spent by reputable organizations on the good works it was raised for it 's equally true that a sizable <unk> was consumed in expenses claimed by other operators including fraudulent expenses 
 in many cases the costs claimed were so high that only a <unk> of cash was left for the <unk> beneficiaries 
 it 's impossible to say exactly how much of the total charity <unk> is <unk> by <unk> fund-raising costs <unk> operators and downright fraud 
 but the problem clearly is widespread and persistent 
 state law enforcers can barely keep up with charity scams and reports from <unk> groups such as the council of better business bureaus are not encouraging 
 the <unk> advisory service of the <unk> reviews hundreds of new charities every year measuring them against minimum standards for accountability for <unk> and honesty in solicitation and for percentage of funds actually going to work for which the charity was supposedly established 
 the service figures at least half of the money taken in should be spent on program 
 roughly a third of the charities reviewed <unk> the test 
 which it should be added does n't prevent the charities from <unk> in a lot of money anyway 
 without a <unk> and a subpoena it 's often hard to sort out <unk> causes from <unk> if all you 've got to go on is the solicitation itself 
 on this basis there 's no way the average person can know a good charity from a bad one says david <unk> an assistant attorney general in connecticut 
 a lot of <unk> just get taken 
 including those he contends who put about $ N million into the <unk> for the connecticut association of concerned veterans and the vietnam veterans service center 
 the state has sued these charities in state court complaining that much of the money was grossly <unk> N N says mr. <unk> went to fund <unk> and most of the rest to the people who ran the charities and to their <unk> for fur coats trips to florida <unk> restaurant <unk> 
 the telephone number for the charity in <unk> conn. has been <unk> and the former officials could n't be located 
 running a charity does cost money but reputable organizations manage to get the lion 's share of donations out to where they are really needed 
 the <unk> foundation the american cancer society and the united way of america all say that they spend roughly N N of their income on programs not overhead 
 with some other charities however it s the other way around 
 the fledgling national children 's cancer society for example took in $ N million last year to finance <unk> transplants for children 
 by the time it paid its expenses it only had $ N left not enough to treat even one child 
 the state of illinois is suing the charity for fraud in chicago along with <unk> marketing inc. its <unk> fund <unk> 
 both deny wrongdoing 
 the charity admits spending a lot on fund raising but says that was necessary to establish a <unk> base it can tap at much lower cost in years to come 
 michael burns president of <unk> says his concern has only benefited from the publicity surrounding the case noting that three other charities have signed on as clients because they were impressed with the amount he raised for national children 's 
 meanwhile a state court judge has allowed the charity to go on soliciting funds 
 enforcers ca n't put charities out of business simply because they spend the lion 's share of their income on fund raising 
 state laws previously used as a <unk> minimum <unk> of income usually half that had to be spent on the program rather than overhead but these have been <unk> by the u.s. supreme court 
 it has ruled that such laws might work to <unk> fund raising which would amount to limiting the charities ' <unk> right to freedom of expression 
 this puts upon enforcers the burden of proving outright fraud or <unk> and such actions have been brought against hundreds of charities recently 
 the attorney general 's office in connecticut alone has put seven of them out of business over the past couple of years and the enforcement drive is continuing there and elsewhere 
 in making cases the authorities frequently zero in on alleged <unk> made by the charities ' fund <unk> 
 illinois for instance currently has under investigation N of the N companies <unk> up funds for charities soliciting there 
 enforcers pay special attention to operators using <unk> prizes as an additional <unk> to give 
 attorneys general in several states including illinois are already suing watson & <unk> co. an <unk> <unk> outfit that they say has used deceptive <unk> ads to <unk> donations for the american heart disease foundation and the cancer fund of america 
 according to the illinois attorney general 's suit watson & <unk> sent <unk> indicating that recipients were guaranteed cash prizes and could win up to an additional $ N on top of them if they contributed as little as $ N 
 but the total value of the prizes was only $ N and most winners will receive just N cents according to the attorney general 's office 
 the suit is still pending in illinois state court 
 watson & <unk> has denied the allegations in court officials decline to comment further 
 while they can target some of the most obvious <unk> enforcers concede that they are only <unk> the surface 
 there are so many <unk> <unk> used by so many dubious operators they say that it is probably impossible to stop them all 
 one maneuver the public education <unk> 
 the solicitation material indicates that donations will go toward a campaign <unk> and <unk> the public about some health or other issue 
 what it does n't say is that the entire campaign may be the fund-raising letter itself 
 all too often this will merely be a statement on the solicitation such as do n't smoke or wear <unk> <unk> says william webster attorney general of missouri 
 by putting these <unk> statements on the <unk> hundreds of thousands of dollars are claimed to have been spent on education to consumers when in fact this represents the costs of sending the newsletters 
 mr. webster cites a <unk> mailing from the united cancer council that offers a chance to win $ N in gold bullion to those giving as little as $ N to cancer education 
 a few <unk> warnings about cancer appear but that 's only two inches in all four pages 
 i think some people may believe they 're helping fund a massive tv and print campaign but we could n't find that the charity does anything except write these letters he says 
 officials at the washington <unk> charity did n't return repeated phone calls 
 many <unk> charities ride the <unk> of the biggest best-known and most reputable ones by adopting names similar to theirs 
 the established charities are bothered by this but say they can do little about it 
 we ca n't police the many organizations that have <unk> up in the last few years using part of our name 
 most of them do n't last for long but in the meantime all we can do is tell people they are n't connected with us says a spokeswoman for the american heart association 
 and sometimes a reputable charity with a household name gets used and does n't even know it 
 a couple in <unk> ill. raised $ N earlier this year using the name and <unk> of mothers against drunk driving without permission from the group 
 <unk> did n't learn of the fund raising until the couple sent it a check for $ N along with a letter saying that was the charity 's share 
 the illinois attorney general won a court order to prevent the couple from raising further funds without <unk> 's permission 
 the couple could n't be reached for comment and apparently have left <unk> law enforcement officials report 
 <unk> mcdonald a spokeswoman for <unk> says it 's scary because anybody could do this

 british airways plc a crucial participant in the proposed buy-out of ual corp. <unk> its hands of the current efforts to revive a bid for the parent of united airlines 
 specifically the british carrier said it currently has no plans to participate in any new offer for ual 
 in addition british air officially withdrew its support for the previous $ 300-a-share bid in a <unk> statement that said the original deal is closed 
 company officials said later that british airways believes its involvement in the ual buy-out ended last friday when the buy-out group which also includes ual 's management and pilot union failed to obtain financing for the $ N billion transaction 
 the carrier stopped short of saying it would n't at some point reconsider participating in any new bid for ual 
 however company officials said they plan to take no initiatives to <unk> the transaction and are n't aware of any restructured bid in the making 
 <unk> the statements raised questions about whether a new bid for ual will ever get off the ground 
 the transaction has had a series of setbacks since the financing problems became known last friday with no signs or statements from the buy-out group to indicate that any progress has taken place 
 however in response to the british air decision united 's pilot union vowed to continue efforts to revive the buy-out 
 pilot union chairman frederick c. <unk> said advisers to ual management and the union will begin meeting in new york today and will work through the weekend to devise a new proposal to present to ual 's board at the earliest time possible 
 pilot union advisers appeared confident that a new bid could go forward even without british air 's participation 
 ual declined to comment on british air 's statement 
 ual chairman stephen m. wolf who is leading the management end of the buy-out has n't provided investors with any assurances about the prospect of a new deal 
 in another setback yesterday united 's <unk> union asked the treasury department to investigate whether certain aspects of the original buy-out proposal violated tax laws 
 in an effort to <unk> the buy-out the union has already called for investigations by the securities and exchange commission transportation department and labor department 
 but there was one bright spot yesterday 
 the united <unk> union agreed to negotiations that could lead to the flight attendants contributing concessions to a revived bid in exchange for an ownership stake 
 the pilot union the only one to support the buy-out thus far said the flight attendants ' decision <unk> our belief that an <unk> owned airline is practical and <unk> 
 still without the assurance of british airways ' financial backing it will be tougher for the buy-out group to convince <unk> banks to make loan commitments for a revised bid especially since british air 's original investment represented N N of the cash equity contribution for the bid 
 under the previous plan british air would have received a N N stake in ual in exchange for a $ N million equity investment with a N N stake going to ual employees and N N to ual management 
 british air officials said the airline 's chairman lord king was concerned about news reports indicating that british air might be willing to participate in a bid that included a lower purchase price and better investment terms for the british carrier 
 the previous reports were based on remarks by british air 's chief financial officer <unk> stevens who said any revised bid would have to include a lower purchase price to reflect the sharp drop in ual 's stock in the past week 
 ual stock dropped $ N yesterday to $ N on volume of N shares in composite trading on the new york stock exchange 
 ual declined to comment on british air 's statement 
 in an interview wednesday with dow jones professional investor report mr. stevens said we 're in no way committed to a deal going through at all 
 we 're not rushing into anything 
 we do n't want to be party to a second rejection 
 indeed british air seemed to be <unk> itself from the troubled transaction early in an effort to avoid any further embarrassment 
 the original transaction fell through on the same day british air shareholders approved the plan at a special meeting after the british succeeded in arranging the financing for its equity contribution 
 the carrier also seemed eager to place blame on its american counterparts 
 the buy-out consortium <unk> to exist because our american partners were not capable of organizing the financing a british air spokesman said 
 british airways may have begun to have second thoughts about the transaction after the transportation department forced northwest 's airlines ' new owners to restructure the equity contribution of <unk> royal dutch airlines in that carrier 
 most of the department 's statements since the northwest transaction indicated it planned to curtail foreign ownership stakes in u.s. carriers 
 even before british air 's announcement pilot union leaders had been meeting in chicago yesterday to consider their options 
 the leaders expressed support for trying to revive the bid following a briefing wednesday by the union 's advisers lazard <unk> & co. and paul weiss <unk> <unk> & garrison 
 they also unanimously <unk> mr. <unk> the union chairman who has led the pilots ' N 1\/2-year fight to take control of the airline 
 ual 's advisers have indicated previously that it may take a while to come forward with a revised plan since they want to have firm bank commitments before launching a new bid 
 they have maintained that banks remain interested in financing the transaction 
 the buy-out fell through after citicorp and chase manhattan corp. the lead banks in the transaction failed to obtain $ N billion in financing needed for the plan 
 italy 's industrial wholesale sales index rose N N in june from a year earlier the state statistical institute istat said 
 the june increase compared with a rise of N N in may from a year earlier 
 domestic wholesale sales rose N N from a year earlier while foreign sales jumped N N istat said 
 for the first six months wholesale sales rose N N from the year before reflecting to a N N jump in domestic sales and a N N boost in foreign sales 
 sales of capital goods to foreign and domestic <unk> increased N N in the <unk> period from a year earlier 
 sales of consumer goods rose N N in the same period while sales of intermediate goods were up N N from a year ago 
 senate democrats <unk> a cut in the capital-gains tax have decided under pressure from their leaders not to offer their own proposal placing another obstacle in the path of president bush 's legislative priority 
 a core group of six or so democratic senators has been working behind the scenes to develop a proposal to reduce the tax on the gain from the sale of assets 
 the plan was complete except for finishing <unk> and there was talk that it would be unveiled as early as yesterday 
 but senate majority leader george mitchell d. maine a vigorous opponent of the capital-gains tax cut called the group to meet with him wednesday night and again yesterday 
 sen. mitchell urged them to <unk> 
 afterward leaders of the dissident democrats <unk> and said they would n't offer their own proposal as they had planned 
 the decision is a setback for president bush who needs the support of democrats to pass the tax cut through the <unk> senate 
 having a proposal sponsored by democrats would have given the president an advantage 
 having only a republican measure makes the task harder 
 still sen. bob packwood r. ore. the lead sponsor of the republican capital-gains amendment predicted that the tax cut would be enacted this year 
 he said a clear majority of senators back the tax reduction and that ultimately there would be enough senators to overcome any procedural hurdle the democratic leadership might <unk> 
 but sen. mitchell buoyed by his victory among fellow democrats strongly disagreed 
 mr. mitchell has been predicting that the president 's initiative would fail this year 
 yesterday in an interview he added that the democrats ' decision increases the likelihood that a capital-gains tax cut will not pass this year 
 mr. mitchell 's first victory came last week when the senate passed a deficit-reduction bill that did n't contain a capital-gains provision 
 that vote made it unlikely that a capital-gains tax cut would be included in the final bill now being drafted by house and senate negotiators 
 the house version of the bill does include the tax cut 
 now republican leaders are concentrating on <unk> a capital-gains amendment to some other bill perhaps a measure raising the federal borrowing limit or a second tax bill that would follow on the heels of the deficit-reduction legislation 
 to help lay the <unk> for that fight president bush plans early next week to meet at the white house with some N democratic senators who favor cutting the capital-gains tax or are <unk> on the issue 
 the president apparently will have only one bill to push sen. packwood 's and at least some of the dissident democrats plan to support it 
 i may want to offer additional amendments to improve it when the bill comes to the floor said sen. david boren d. okla. a leader of those democrats 
 the packwood plan as expected would allow individuals to exclude from income N N of the gain from the sale of a capital asset held for more than one year 
 the exclusion would rise five percentage points for each year the asset was held until it reached a maximum of N N after seven years 
 the exclusion would apply to assets sold after oct. N 
 as an alternative taxpayers could chose to reduce their gains by an inflation index 
 for corporations the top tax rate on the sale of assets held for more than three years would be cut to N N from the current top rate of N N 
 that rate would gradually decline to as little as N N for corporate assets held for N years 
 the packwood plan also would include a proposal designed by sen. william roth r. del. that would create new tax benefits for individual retirement accounts 
 the roth plan would create a new <unk> ira from which money could be withdrawn tax-free not only for retirement but also for the purchase of a first home education expenses and medical expenses 
 current iras could be rolled over into the new iras but would be subject to tax though no penalty 
 westmoreland coal co. <unk> benefits of a sustained effort to cut costs and boost productivity reported sharply improved third-quarter results 
 the producer and marketer of <unk> coal said net income for the quarter was $ N million or N cents a share on revenue of $ N million 
 for the year-earlier period the company reported a loss of $ N or six cents a share 
 in the latest nine months the company earned $ N million or $ N a share 
 last year 's net loss of $ N included a benefit of $ N from an accounting change 
 revenue for the nine months rose to $ N million from $ N million 
 in an interview <unk> hutchinson president and chief executive cited several reasons for the improvement higher employee productivity and good natural conditions in the mines as well as lower costs for materials administrative overhead and debt interest 
 in the latest nine months mr. hutchinson said total coal sales rose to about N million tons from about N million tons a year earlier 
 in addition long-term debt has been trimmed to about $ N million from $ N million since jan. N 
 he predicted the debt ratio will improve further in coming quarters 
 westmoreland 's strategy is to retain and expand its core business of mining and selling <unk> coal in the <unk> region 
 the operating territory includes coal terminals on the ohio river and in newport news va 
 westmoreland exports about a fourth of its coal <unk> including a significant amount of <unk> coal produced by others that is used by steelmakers overseas 
 for the past couple of years westmoreland has undertaken an aggressive streamlining of all aspects of its business 
 marginal operations and assets have been sold 
 the size of the company 's board has been reduced to eight directors from N 
 about N <unk> management jobs and hundreds of hourly wage positions have been eliminated 
 even <unk> have been reduced 
 for example the chief executive himself now pays N N of the cost of his health benefits the company used to pay N N 
 i think the ship is now <unk> the <unk> are pumped and we are on course mr. hutchinson said of the restructuring program 
 much of what we set out to do is completed 
 but he cautioned that westmoreland 's third quarter is typically better than the fourth so investors should n't just <unk> the third quarter by four and assume the same rate of improvement can be sustained 
 one difference he said is that the fourth quarter has significantly fewer <unk> because of holidays and the hunting season 
 i do n't want to give the impression that everybody can relax now he said 
 we have to keep working at improving our core business to stay efficient 
 it 's a process that never really ends 
 nevertheless mr. hutchinson predicted that N would be <unk> profitable for westmoreland and that N would bring more of the same 
 for all of N the company reported an after-tax operating loss of $ N on revenue of $ N million 
 an accounting adjustment made net income $ N million or N cents a share 
 in a move that <unk> the company 's basic strategy its westmoreland energy inc. unit is developing four <unk> <unk> plants with a partner in virginia 
 some of the coal the plants buy will come from westmoreland mines 
 mr. hutchinson predicted that the unit 's contribution to company results in the 1990s will be exciting 
 he said westmoreland is looking at investment stakes in other <unk> plants east of the mississippi river 
 westmoreland expects energy demand to grow annually in the N N range in the early 1990s 
 we see coal 's piece of the action growing mr. hutchinson said 
 coal prices while not <unk> will grow modestly in real terms we think 
 chase manhattan corp. after trying unsuccessfully to sell its interest in its lower manhattan operations building has exercised its option to purchase the <unk> office tower 
 chase had purchased an option to buy the building at one new york plaza for an undisclosed sum from the late <unk> atlas as part of its original lease in N 
 the current transaction cost the bank approximately $ N million 
 of that amount $ N million was payment for the land <unk> the building and the rest was for the building itself 
 the building houses about N chase workers most of whom will be moved to downtown brooklyn after the bank 's new back office center is completed in N 
 the move is part of chase 's strategy to consolidate its back offices under one <unk> 
 the headquarters is located a few blocks away at N chase manhattan plaza 
 as part of its decision to leave the building chase tried to sell its interest along with the atlas estate 's interest shortly after the october N stock market crash 
 chase senior vice president george <unk> said the bank decided to exercise its option after bids fell short of expectations 
 he said chase and the atlas estate were looking to sell the entire building for $ N million to $ N million but did n't get an offer for more than $ N million 
 as the building 's new owner chase will have its work cut out for it 
 chase is <unk> N million square feet of space and salomon brothers inc. whose headquarters is in the building also plans to move shortly 
 in addition another major building <unk> thomson <unk> inc. 's thomson <unk> securities likely will <unk> the premises as part of its liquidation 
 new york real estate brokerage edward s. gordon co. will have the difficult task of finding new tenants 
 even with its striking views of the new york harbor the building is considered <unk> by modern office standards 
 and chase will have to spend approximately $ N million to remove asbestos from the premises 
 wall street shake hands with george <unk> 
 the author of the <unk> novel N invented a language called <unk> that made it impossible to fully develop a <unk> thought that is anything negative about the policies and practices of the state 
 wall street has n't gotten that far yet but it has made a promising start 
 its language call it <unk> is increasingly <unk> reassuring and designed to make financial products and <unk> appear better safer or cheaper than they really are 
 when something <unk> nasty happens a few <unk> are deployed to simply make it disappear much as a fresh grave may be covered by a blanket of flowers 
 for example we 'll bet you thought that the stock market <unk> two years ago 
 wrong 
 according to some of the grand <unk> of the market it never happened

 customers hear a lot of this stuff from people who try to sell them stock 
 these people used to be called brokers but apparently this word either is not <unk> enough or carries too many negative <unk> from the <unk> technical correction when <unk> customers could n't raise brokers on the phone 
 either way the word broker is clearly out of favor 
 of the major new york-based securities firms only morgan stanley & co. still calls its salespeople brokers 
 at merrill lynch & co. and shearson lehman hutton inc. they are financial consultants 
 at drexel burnham lambert inc. prudential <unk> securities and dean witter reynolds inc. they are account executives 
 at painewebber inc. they are investment executives 
 such titles are designed to convey a sense of <unk> <unk> <unk> and expertise in selling today 's <unk> financial products 
 it is a <unk> and expertise that some brokers themselves <unk> by all the new things being <unk> up for them to <unk> do n't feel 
 it s almost product de <unk> <unk> one account executive at dean witter 
 the <unk> brokers never let the <unk> cross their <unk> instead stressing such terms as safe insured and guaranteed even though these terms may be severely limited in their application to a particular new financial product 
 the names of some of these products do n't suggest the risk involved in buying them either 
 a case in point <unk> bond funds 
 what could <unk> more safety than investing in government bonds 
 what could be better than getting a <unk> more income from them the plus than other people 
 indeed conservative investors many of them elderly have poured more than $ N billion into such funds which promise <unk> yields than ordinary treasury bonds only to learn later that these funds use part of their money to <unk> in high-risk bond options a <unk> 's game 
 when a certain class of investment <unk> so poorly that its reputation is <unk> look for wall street to give it a new <unk> 
 this seems to be happening now to limited partnerships many of which either have gone into the tank in recent years or have otherwise been <unk> disappointments 
 they are still being sold but more and more often as direct investments with all the same risks they had under the old label 
 in such cases the game has n't changed only the name 
 in others a familiar old name still <unk> but the underlying game has changed 
 for example no load mutual funds remain a favorite with investors because they do n't carry a <unk> sales commission 
 getting out of them however may be a different story now 
 traditional <unk> made their money by charging an annual management fee usually a modest one they imposed no other fees and many still do n't 
 in recent years though a <unk> of others flying the <unk> flag have been imposing hefty charges all the way up to N N when an investor sells his shares 
 should n't they properly be called <unk> funds 
 the mutual-fund industry is <unk> the question but do n't expect a new name while the old one is working so well 
 and do n't expect anyone to change the term blue chip either even though some of the companies that still enjoy the title may be riskier investments than they were 
 american telephone & telegraph co. for one is still a favorite of <unk> <unk> and trust departments but <unk> of its regional telephone units and exposed to competition on every side it is a far different investment prospect than it was before divestiture 
 also blue chips in general have suffered much more short-term price volatility in recent years 
 larry <unk> a money manager in san mateo calif. blames that on the advent of program trading in which computers used by big institutional investors are <unk> to buy and sell big blocks when certain market conditions prevail 
 blue chips he says are now being referred to as <unk> chips 
 finally even the <unk> strategy called value investing no longer means what it once did 
 before the takeover mania of the '80s it referred to <unk> out through analysis undervalued stocks especially those with <unk> management sound fundamentals and decent prospects 
 now says mr. <unk> value investing often means looking for <unk> companies with terrible management that are in real trouble 
 to institutional investors or brokers he adds a company with value is a company at risk of being <unk> up 
 ms. <unk> covers personal finance from the wall street journal 's los angeles bureau 
 i was <unk> to read your recent news stories on the banking industry 's reserve additions and <unk> threats to cease making new loans to less-developed countries 
 if the whole story were told it would read something like this 
 during the 1970s the commercial banks <unk> the country loan business away from the bond markets where the discipline of a prospectus and use of proceeds confirmation allowed lenders to audit expenditures of old loans before new loans were made 
 the reward for that reckless lending was high reported earnings and management bonuses the price a sea of bad loans 
 for the past several years the banks lacking a private navy to enforce their interests have been <unk> the u.s. treasury to underwrite their bad <unk> credits 
 the treasury <unk> has refused but has concluded that indirect credit support through various multinational agencies should be made available for a price either debt reduction or <unk> reduction or new loans the brady plan 
 the banks will threaten not to make further loans but in truth lacking the capital to write off their mistakes or to build a navy they have no alternative but to go along

 within two days he was on his way to new york and tokyo to meet with top <unk> at sony 
 and before the week was out sony had offered mr. guber and his partner jon peters the most lucrative employment contracts in the history of the movie business 
 not only that sony also agreed to give them a stake in columbia 's future profits and buy their company guber peters entertainment co. for $ N million almost N N more than the market value of the company 
 there was just one sticking point the two had a prior commitment 
 just seven months earlier they had signed a five-year exclusive contract to make movies for warner bros. for which they had just produced the <unk> hit batman 
 but mr. guber figured that warner communications inc. chairman steven ross would <unk> and let the producers go knowing the sony offer was the culmination of a life 's work 
 he figured wrong 
 last week following <unk> settlement talks warner now <unk> with time inc. filed a $ N billion breach of contract suit in los angeles superior court against both sony and guber peters 
 sony promptly <unk> charging warner with trying to sabotage its acquisitions and hurt its efforts to enter the u.s. movie business 
 the accusations of lying and <unk> are flying thick and fast on both sides as one sony executive puts it it 's world war iii 
 that two successful producers who are n't all that well known outside hollywood could occasion such a clash of corporate <unk> suggests how desperate the <unk> for proven talent is in the movie business 
 and they are a very odd team in any case 
 mr. guber was raised in boston and educated in new york 
 he is a lawyer with a string of academic degrees 
 mr. peters is a high-school <unk> who came to fame as <unk> <unk> 's <unk> 
 yet they are far and away the most <unk> producers in hollywood 
 and despite their share of <unk> they make movies that make money 
 that is a <unk> sony badly needs and warner is loath to lose 
 although columbia had a good summer with <unk> ii and when harry met <unk> rivals such as warner paramount pictures walt disney co. and universal studios have been <unk> columbia at the box office 
 after five years of management turmoil with four different studio heads columbia <unk> needs a stable <unk> team to restore its credibility and get it back in the business of making hits 
 mr. guber and mr. peters are n't <unk> loved in hollywood but they are well connected 
 their stock in trade as executive producers is <unk> out hot properties <unk> them up and then getting big studios to <unk> and distribute them 
 sometimes mr. guber and mr. peters do little more than grab the first draft of a <unk> for a <unk> or buy rights to a best seller such as the color <unk> 
 it falls to others to do the writing <unk> and producing 
 with mgm\/ua 's <unk> for instance messrs. guber and peters had virtually nothing to do with day-to-day production but their names still appear in big letters on the credits and they are inevitably associated with its success 
 sometimes as with batman the pair really do make the film 
 in that case guber peters acquired the rights in N <unk> the movie through a dozen scripts and were on the set in london for N months <unk> over the most minute changes in casting and production 
 they 're the best production talent around says brian de <unk> <unk> to guber peters for hiring him to direct the warner movie of tom <unk> 's novel <unk> of the <unk> 
 on that film which is to start shooting in a few months they 've been very much involved hiring talent and discussing the development of the script 
 and when you 're making a movie this big you need all the help you can get mr. de <unk> adds 
 i wish they were around N hours a day 
 and some movies seem to have been hurt by their <unk> 
 warner executives blame mr. guber 's and mr. peters 's lack of involvement in <unk> ii for casting and production problems and the film 's ultimate dismal failure 
 we 've had a few <unk> admits mr. peters 
 but by and large this company has only been profitable 
 he says his company 's <unk> at packaging and marketing is why we 'll be good at columbia 
 we practically ran our own studio 
 longtime hollywood associates describe mr. guber as the intellectual powerhouse of the two a man with a <unk> for <unk> and marketing 
 peter is a major piece of hollywood manpower who has really earned his success says robert <unk> an agent at creative artists agency 
 mark johnson the producer of <unk> <unk> in he has a great ability to hire <unk> people and delegate authority 
 it 's no accident that they 've been able to develop such successful material 
 mr. peters on the other hand has fewer fans in hollywood and his <unk> like to <unk> him as something of a <unk> <unk> 
 he gets better reviews as a creative <unk> an <unk> an idea man 
 he also had to fight harder for credibility than his partner did 
 <unk> <unk> made him famous 
 he cut her hair 
 he lived with her 
 he came to produce her records and her movies a star is born and the main event 
 <unk> married but now single mr. peters got plenty of ink last summer for an <unk> <unk> with actress kim <unk> during the making of batman 
 mr. guber by contrast has been married to one woman for more than N years 
 but for all their intellectual and <unk> differences they make the perfect good <unk> bad <unk> team hollywood associates say 
 peter is the bright sympathetic guy when you 're doing a deal says one agent 
 if there 's a problem peter disappears and all of a sudden jon shows up 
 mr. guber and mr. peters <unk> many people in hollywood the wrong way 
 producers don simpson and jerry <unk> who <unk> <unk> through several scripts and ultimately produced the movie <unk> when messrs. guber and peters take credit for the film 
 says mr. simpson the script was <unk> 
 we <unk> it 
 we are the producers of that movie 
 they got a small piece of the net profits and a screen credit as executive producers 
 when roger <unk> an executive who worked for guber peters in the early 1980s left to take a job as head of production at the united artists studio they made him <unk> all credits and financial interest in the films he had helped develop including <unk> and batman 
 mr. peters acknowledges that and says it 's not unlike the situation he and mr. guber are in with warner 
 i was upset with roger i <unk> and <unk> says mr. peters 
 but he wanted to pursue his own dream and he went 
 still mr. <unk> says his relationship with guber peters was one of the most successful i 've had in hollywood 
 the two have a wonderful chemistry jon is very <unk> and peter is very <unk> adds mr. <unk> who is now head of production at news corp. 's 20th century fox film co 
 jon peters will come <unk> into a room say he 's got a great idea and be gone 
 peter will take the <unk> of that idea and make it grow into something specific 
 mr. <unk> recalls that mr. guber and mr. peters shifted into high gear a few years back upon learning that they had competition for the story of the murdered <unk> <unk> <unk> which became <unk> in the <unk> 
 he says within a few weeks we made deals with the government of <unk> and everyone who had ever met or talked to <unk> <unk> 
 i think peter even made some deals with the <unk> 
 universal studios was working on a competing film but the studio and its producers ultimately agreed to <unk> the film with guber peters and warner 
 more recently guber peters beat out a dozen other producers reportedly including robert redford and ted turner for rights to the life story of <unk> <unk> the murdered brazilian union leader who fought developers in the <unk> rain forest 
 messrs. guber and peters <unk> <unk> the man 's widow for months showing her a tape of <unk> in the <unk> to <unk> her with the quality of their work 
 money helped too 
 ultimately they paid more than $ N million for the rights 
 the sale caused a <unk> between the widow and some of her husband 's <unk> 
 some of the money will go to the <unk> <unk> foundation but it is n't earmarked for groups trying to save the rain forest 
 it 's hardly <unk> given the men 's track record that sony wants mr. guber and mr. peters 
 but it is <unk> to some hollywood executives that sony rushed to hire them without clearing up the warner situation first 
 some note that sony might have saved itself some trouble by just hiring mr. guber and letting mr. peters stay on to fulfill the warner contract 
 but though people in town may ask why guber needs peters it 's good to have a partner and obviously the chemistry works says steven tisch a producer who once worked for mr. guber 
 this business is n't about <unk> at the end of the day it s about whether the ink is red or black 
 in the case of peter and jon the ink has been very very black 
 mr. guber got his start in the movie business at columbia two decades ago 
 recruited from new york university 's <unk> program he rose within two years to head of production overseeing such films as the way we were taxi driver <unk> and <unk> 
 in N he <unk> up with record producer neil bogart in <unk> records and <unk> later called <unk> pictures where they produced such hits as as the deep and midnight express 
 in N mr. guber got together with mr. peters by then a successful producer in his own right after the death of mr. bogart 
 while guber peters produced a number of hits for warner and others their record was n't always so impressive 
 among their <unk> were the <unk> of <unk> jean <unk> clue and <unk> of the <unk> bear 
 and the failures make it possible for warner in its current lawsuit to <unk> the producers as <unk> 
 the studio says it stuck with them even in the early years when the creative partnership was not particularly profitable for warner 
 mr. guber replies that this is a <unk> this time warner trying to <unk> up two <unk> who have done only well for them for a long period of time 
 mr. guber and mr. peters maintain that executives at warner have always known of their ambitions to run a major entertainment powerhouse but that warner never felt threatened until they linked up with sony 
 from the beginning they knew we had a goal and a dream says mr. guber 
 on a number of occasions he adds he tried to get warner to buy guber peters outright 
 they always <unk> but they never acted mr. guber says 
 in N mr. guber and mr. peters contributed their company 's assets in exchange for a N N stake in <unk> entertainment a <unk> tv production company controlled by giant industries inc. chairman burt sugarman 
 in july a year later warner agreed to release the producers from their old contract when messrs. guber peters and sugarman made a $ N million offer to buy N N of mgm\/ua 
 mr. guber and mr. peters planned to run the nearly <unk> mgm studio and the two even tried to interest warner <unk> president terry semel in becoming a partner after he advised them on the deal 
 but the mgm plan collapsed just two weeks later 
 mr. guber and mr. peters say they got a look at the books and balked at the price 
 their relationship with mr. sugarman <unk> shortly thereafter 
 last may he sold his N N stake in <unk> to a passive australian investor and <unk> was renamed guber peters entertainment co 
 meanwhile mr. guber and mr. peters had agreed to extend their warner agreement with the new five-year exclusive contract 
 the new deal was considered the most generous of its kind both financially and in terms of creative freedom 
 but it <unk> by comparison to what sony was to offer last month the chance at last to run a major studio about $ N million in deferred compensation up to N N of columbia 's future cash flow N N of the future appreciation of columbia 's market value and annual salaries of $ N million for each 
 the producers ' N N share of publicly held guber peters would net them an additional $ N million 
 sony also agreed to <unk> the producers against any liability to warner 
 sony is paying a hefty price for a company that had revenue of only $ N million last year 
 and earnings have been <unk> 
 in the the latest quarter thanks in part to batman guber peters earned $ N million or N cents a share compared to a loss of $ N million or N cents a share in last year 's quarter 
 guber peters stock which traded as low as $ N a share last year closed yesterday at $ N 
 the two sides now are <unk> each other of lying 
 mr. guber and mr. peters claim they have an oral agreement with warner executives that allows them to terminate their contract should the opportunity to run a major studio arise 
 but in affidavits filed yesterday in the los angeles court mr. ross warner bros. chairman robert daly and president semel deny that such an oral agreement was ever made 
 warner in its court filings calls it a piece of <unk> created for this litigation 
 mr. daly in his affidavit acknowledges that warner agreed to release the producers last year to take over mgm but says that situation was altogether different 
 for one thing according to mr. daly the producers requested a release in advance 
 moreover the old contract was about to expire and the lineup of guber peters pictures for warner was n't as strong as it is now 
 warner itself was in negotiations with mgm over certain movie and other rights and it was in warner 's interest to accommodate mgm\/ua guber and peters by permitting them to become mgm executives mr. daly said in his affidavit 
 warner obviously does n't think that it is in its own interests to let mr. guber and mr. peters go off to columbia 
 at the very least mr. ross clearly sees an opportunity to use the two men to get a pound of <unk> from sony 
 during settlement talks for example warner demanded such things as cable tv rights to columbia movies and columbia 's interest in the studio it jointly owns with warner according to executives involved in the talks 
 in any settlement warner is almost certain to demand rights to most of the N or so projects mr. guber and mr. peters have locked up for the next few years notably <unk> to batman 
 mr. guber and mr. peters refuse to concede that they may have made a tactical error in accepting the sony offer before taking it up with warner 
 and they say there are plenty of <unk> in hollywood for letting people out of contracts 
 the last time columbia pictures was looking for a studio chief they note warner released producer david <unk> from his contract then took him back after he was subsequently fired by his bosses at columbia 
 in his affidavit filed yesterday warner 's mr. ross indicated he is n't buying any such argument if sony succeeds here no written contract in hollywood will be worth the paper it 's written on 
 the sales pitch could n't sound better 
 first there 's the name asset-backed securities 
 better than all those offers you get to buy securities backed by nothing 
 and there 's more 
 the assets backing the securities come from some of the country 's biggest and most secure institutions 
 most earn high ratings from credit agencies 
 their yields are higher than those of u.s. treasury issues 
 and the booming market has already attracted many of the nation 's biggest institutional investors 
 ready to jump 
 well think twice 
 the concept may be simple take a bunch of loans tie them up in one neat package and sell pieces of the package to investors 
 but the <unk> may be misleading 
 skeptics say the slightly higher returns are n't enough to compensate for the extra risk 
 they warn that asset-backed securities are only as good as the assets and credit backing that support them and those are hard to evaluate 
 moreover the securities were introduced only about N N years ago the biggest unknown is how they will fare in a recession 
 a lot of this stuff really is in <unk> waters says owen <unk> director of the investment securities division of the u.s. comptroller of the currency 
 we do n't know how this whole market will work in a serious economic downturn 
 such concerns however have n't stopped asset-backed securities from becoming one of wall street 's hottest new products 
 since the spring of N financial <unk> have transformed a wide variety of debt into these new securities 
 they have sold issues backed by car loans boat loans and <unk> loans 
 they have offered <unk> of <unk> loans as well as packages of loans used to buy vacation <unk> 
 last year there was an issue of <unk> bonds securities backed by loans to life-insurance policyholders 
 some predict there will be third world bonds backed by loans to brazil argentina and other <unk> nations 
 and the biggest volume this year has been on securities backed by credit-card receivables sometimes known as plastic bonds 
 this is the <unk> of debt says james grant editor of grant 's interest rate <unk> a newsletter 
 before the sun sets on the '80s it seems nothing will be left <unk> 
 the result is a $ N billion market according to securities data co 
 that includes more than $ N billion issued through august of this year up sharply from $ N billion in the comparable N period and more than in all of N 
 most issues have been sold to professional money managers pension funds bank trust departments and other institutions 
 but wealthy individuals also have been jumping in and lately brokers have been pushing smaller investors into the asset-backed market 
 the entry fee is affordable issues typically are sold in minimum denominations of $ N 
 we expect additional offerings of asset-backed securities targeted toward individual investors says bill <unk> a senior vice president at shearson lehman hutton inc 
 the process typically begins when an institution such as citibank or sears roebuck & co. takes a pool of credit-card or other receivables and sells them to a specially created trust 
 the trust then issues securities generally due in five years or less that are underwritten by wall street brokerage firms and offered to investors 
 issues typically come with credit <unk> such as a bank letter of credit and thus have received high credit ratings 
 enthusiasts say the booming market has opened up a valuable new source of funds to issuers while providing a valuable new investment for individuals and institutions 
 asset-backed securities are an attractive investment compared to bank certificates of deposit or other corporate bonds says craig j. goldberg managing director and head of the asset-backed securities group at merrill lynch capital markets 
 but skeptics question whether asset-backed bonds offer sufficient rewards to compensate for the extra risks 
 consider a $ N million offering of N N securities issued last spring and backed by citibank credit-card receivables 
 the <unk> issue offered a yield of only about N percentage point above four-year treasury issues 
 on a $ N investment that 's a difference of only $ N a year 
 that kind of spread can be critical for money managers who buy bonds in large quantities and whose <unk> depends on <unk> the money manager across the street 
 but for individuals who buy much smaller amounts and care less about relative performance than in preserving what they have that margin is <unk> 
 if you 're in the bond business playing the <unk> <unk> then even an extra N basis points N percentage point becomes an important consideration on a career basis says mr. grant 
 but if you 're an individual investing money and trying to get it back again then that is n't of overwhelming importance 
 moreover the interest on asset-backed securities is fully taxable while interest on treasury issues is tax-free at the state and local level 
 that 's why some investment managers such as alex powers a vice president of chase manhattan bank 's private banking division do n't recommend most asset-backed issues for individuals in <unk> states such as new york or california 
 but mr. powers has purchased asset-backed issues for individuals with <unk> accounts such as retirement plans 
 he points out that institutions buying asset-backed issues in large quantities can earn higher spreads over treasurys than individuals buying smaller amounts 
 another concern is liquidity or how easily a security can be converted into cash 
 the secondary or resale market for asset-backed securities is relatively new and much less active than for treasury issues 
 that could make it tricky for investors who need to sell their holdings quickly before the securities mature 
 that 's particularly true analysts say for certain of the securities such as those backed by <unk> loans 
 you could see massive gyrations here because it 's such a <unk> traded market says jonathan s. paris a vice president of european investors inc. a new york <unk> firm 
 in addition an investor who wants to know the daily value of treasury bonds or corporate bonds traded on the new york stock exchange can simply check newspaper listings 
 there are n't any such listings for asset-backed securities 
 evaluating asset-backed securities <unk> another problem 
 investors for instance may mistakenly assume that the bank or company that originally held the assets is <unk> the securities 
 it is n't 
 the front cover of the prospectus for the citibank credit-card receivables offering points out in bold capital letters that the certificates represent an interest only in the specially created trust and do not represent interests in or obligations of the banks citibank <unk> citicorp or any affiliate <unk> 
 in other words if there 's a problem do n't expect citibank to come to the rescue 
 the prospectus also notes that the securities are not guaranteed by any government agency 
 that means investors have to focus on the quality of the debt that lies beneath the securities as well as on the credit <unk> for the issue and the credit ratings the issue has received 
 that also is n't easy 
 take the credit <unk> which typically include a bank letter of credit or insurance from a <unk> company 
 the letter of credit typically is not offered by the bank selling the assets to back the securities 
 nor does it cover the entire portfolio 
 details of credit <unk> vary widely from issue to issue 
 still they play a crucial role in winning top ratings for most asset-backed issues which in turn is why the yield above treasurys is so slim 
 but skeptics ask why you should bother buying this stuff when you can get only slightly lower yields on <unk> paper 
 when you buy an asset-backed issue you take the risk that a bank or an insurer could run into unexpected difficulties 
 if a bank 's credit rating was lowered because of say its loans to third world nations that could also affect the ratings liquidity and prices of the asset-backed issues that the bank supports 
 underwriters insist these issues are constructed to withstand extremely tough economic conditions 
 but despite the credit <unk> despite the high ratings some money managers still worry that a recession could <unk> havoc on the underlying assets 
 at a time when americans are leveraged to their <unk> asset-backed investors may be taking a <unk> gamble that consumers will be able to repay loans in hard times 
 at the very least a recession would prompt investors to buy the <unk> bonds they can find that is treasurys 
 that could widen the yield spread between treasurys and asset-backed securities as well as make it tougher to unload the latter 
 but it could be much worse 
 some analysts are especially wary of credit-card issues 
 for one thing credit-card loans are unsecured 
 in addition they fear that banks have been <unk> to issue cards to the public giving cards to too many big <unk> who will default during a recession 
 a day of <unk> is coming where we think the market will place a high premium on the <unk> debt issues and therefore we think the best debt investment is u.s. government bonds says craig <unk> of <unk> futures inc. an investment advisory firm 
 what about <unk> asset-backed issues 
 <unk> we still say to stick with treasurys mr. <unk> replies 
 ratings he notes are subject to change 
 all this makes asset-backed securities seem too risky for many people 
 and it <unk> raymond f. devoe jr. a market strategist at legg mason wood walker inc. of what he calls devoe 's <unk> but highly probable theory no. N

 if you force financial planners to sum up their most important advice in a single sentence it would probably be a <unk> sentence diversify 
 judging by a poll of wall street journal readers conducted this summer by <unk> & morgan inc. serious investors have taken that advice to heart 
 nearly N investors responded to the journal 's poll providing an <unk> look at their portfolios 
 those portfolios are <unk> diversified 
 by spreading their wealth among several investment alternatives the respondents have protected themselves against <unk> in any one area be it stocks bonds or real estate 
 for example about N N of journal readers owned stock down slightly from N N in a similar poll last year 
 but only N N said they had more than half their money in the stock market 
 similarly N N of respondents own shares in a money-market mutual fund and N N own municipal bonds 
 but only N N to N N of the investors were committing more than half their funds to either of those alternatives 
 the poll conducted aug. N also provides a <unk> into the thinking of serious investors on a variety of other topics 
 it found them in a cautious but not <unk> mood 
 of N people sent a <unk> N replied 
 the response rate more than N N allows the results to be interpreted with a high degree of confidence 
 the results ca n't be <unk> to all investors though 
 journal readers are relatively affluent with a median household income of between $ N and $ N 
 nearly half of the respondents N N said their investment portfolio was worth $ N or more and N N said it was worth $ N million or more 
 the respondents were mildly optimistic about the economy and investment markets but their collective judgments were a <unk> more <unk> than they were a year ago 
 for example N N of this year 's respondents said they expect a recession within N months 
 last year only N N were expecting a recession 
 an additional N N of this year 's respondents expect the economy to slow down during the next N months 
 only N N of last year 's respondents anticipated slowing growth 
 apparently the respondents do n't think that an economic slowdown would harm the major investment markets very much 
 a slim majority N N think stock prices will be higher in august N than they were in august N 
 their verdict on real estate is almost the same 
 some N N expect real estate in their local area to increase in value over the next N months 
 by contrast only N N expect an increase in the price of gold 
 since gold tends to soar when inflation is high that finding suggests that people believe inflation remains under control 
 even though only N N actually predicted a recession many respondents were taking a <unk> sorry investment stance 
 nearly a third said they have made some portfolio changes to anticipate a possible recession 
 for the most part the changes were slight 
 the two-thirds who have n't tried to make their portfolios more <unk> were split about evenly between investors who do n't believe in trying to predict the markets about N N and investors who do n't expect a recession about N N or are <unk> if and when a recession might come about N N 
 a <unk> approach to stocks continues to be the rule among respondents 
 most own two to N stocks and buy or sell no more than three times a year 
 some N N had bought some stock in the past year only N N had sold any 
 but the <unk> shadow of N 's stock-market crash still seems dark 
 about N N considered another crash likely while about N N said one is unlikely 
 those <unk> hardly changed from the previous year 's poll 
 and the respondents ' commitment to the stock market remains somewhat lighter than usual 
 about N N of them said they would ordinarily have at least N N of their money in stocks 
 but as of august only N N actually had stock-market investments of that size 
 most stock-market indexes were hitting <unk> highs at around the time of the poll 
 but it appears that many journal readers were taking that news as a sign to be cautious rather than a signal to jump on the <unk>

 electronic theft by foreign and industrial <unk> and <unk> employees is costing u.s. companies billions and eroding their international competitive advantage 
 that was the message delivered by government and private security experts at an <unk> conference on corporate electronic <unk> 
 hostile and even friendly nations routinely steal information from u.s. companies and share it with their own companies said <unk> d. <unk> a former <unk> at the federal national security agency and now president of information security inc. silver spring md

 you can have a dozen competitors stealing your secrets at the same time mr. <unk> said adding it 's a pretty good bet they wo n't get caught 
 the only way to catch an electronic thief he said is to set him up with <unk> information

 the university implied that it would drop its opposition to foreign ownership if ciba-geigy and chiron are successful with their lower bid 
 it said the new agreement would replace the old one that forms the basis of its suit against the merieux takeover 
 notwithstanding foreign ownership of connaught this accord would enhance research and development in canada said james <unk> the university 's vice president of research

 from my orange seat i looked over the <unk> line and the <unk> ball field in the warm sun of the last few minutes before what was to have been the third game of the world series 
 it was five in the afternoon but that was pacific time 
 back in new york the work day was already over so i did n't have to feel guilty 
 even still i did feel <unk> and i could n't help <unk> my father 's <unk> for a rich medical <unk> who would go to watch the <unk> on summer <unk> 
 this <unk> the stick was not a classic baseball stadium too <unk> too much <unk> concrete 
 and it did n't have the crowded wild <unk> of yankee stadium 
 but i liked the easy <unk> of the people around me liked it that they 'd brought their children found it <unk> that true citizens of the state of the future they had brought so many tvs and <unk> to stay in touch with <unk> at a live event 
 maybe it was their <unk> sense of history 
 the broadcasters were after all <unk> the game <unk> its <unk> for millions outside the stick 
 why not watch or hear your experience <unk> while you were living it 
 the day was <unk> with the weight of its own impending history 
 long lines of people waited to buy special <unk> world series <unk> with official <unk> 
 thousands of us had paid $ N for the official <unk> book with its historical <unk> on series <unk> its historical photographs of great moments in series past and its instructions in english and spanish for filling in the <unk> 
 <unk> <unk> <unk> 
 <unk> <unk> <unk> 
 players ran out on the field way below and the stands began to <unk> 
 it must be a local custom i thought <unk> feet to welcome the team 
 but then the noise turned into a <unk> 
 and no one was shouting 
 no one around me was saying anything 
 because we all were busy riding a wave 
 <unk> thousand <unk> <unk> a concrete wall waiting for the <unk> 
 only at the moment of maximum roll did i grasp what was going on 
 then i remembered the quake of <unk> which i experienced in santa barbara in a <unk> motel room 
 when the <unk> of the building <unk> me up i <unk> that a i was in southern california b the bed was moving c it must be a magic fingers bed that had <unk> 
 then i noticed the overhead light was <unk> on its <unk> and realized what had happened 
 what should i do 
 get out of the possibly <unk> building to the parking lot 
 but the lot might split into <unk> so i had better stand on my car which probably was wider than the average <unk> 
 fortunately the quake was over before i managed to run out and stand naked on the <unk> 
 at the stick while the world shook i thought of that morning and then it struck me that this time was different 
 if i survived i would have achieved every journalist 's highest wish 
 i was an <unk> of the most <unk> event on the planet at that moment 
 what was my <unk> 
 how would i file 
 all these thoughts <unk> through my head in the N seconds of the earthquake 's actual <unk> 
 the rest is of course history 
 the stick did n't fall 
 the real <unk> occurred elsewhere as we soon found out 
 but for a few minutes there relief <unk> 
 a young mother found her boy who had been out buying a <unk> 
 the wall behind me was slightly <unk> but the center had held 
 and most of us waited for a while for the game to start 
 then we began to file out to wait <unk> on <unk> <unk> for the opening pitch 
 it was during the quiet exodus down the <unk> concrete <unk> of the stick that i really understood the point of all those <unk> and <unk> 
 the crowd moved in <unk> <unk> <unk> around an electronic <unk> 
 in this way while the stick itself was <unk> out we kept up to date on events 
 within N minutes of the quake itself i was able to see pictures of the collapsed section of the bay bridge 
 increasingly accurate estimates of the <unk> of the quake became available before i got to my car 
 and by then expensive automobile sound systems were keeping the <unk> parking lot by the bay informed about the fire causing the big black <unk> of smoke we saw on the northern horizon 
 <unk> fell 
 but the <unk> continued through the <unk> night with pictures of the <unk> highway <unk> in oakland and <unk> in the marina district 
 by then our little sand village of cars had been linked with a global village of <unk> and viewers 
 everyone at the stick that day had started out as a <unk> and ended up as a participant 
 in fact the entire population of the bay area had ended up with this dual role of actor and audience 
 the reporters were victims and some of the victims turned into <unk> reporters 
 the outstanding example of this was the <unk> on the bay bridge who had the presence of mind to take out a video camera at the absolutely crucial moment and record the car in front as it fell into the gap in the roadway

 investors who received shearson lehman hutton inc. 's latest stock commentary may be left with blank <unk> 
 the first N pages of the <unk> weekly portfolio perspective are completely blank except for the page numbers 
 rather than printing <unk> shearson puts all the blame on the <unk> stock market 
 the plunge made shearson 's market commentary instantly out of date 
 in fact last friday 's 190.58-point tumble in the stock market caught many people and businesses by surprise not the least of them brokerage firms such as shearson that print their weekly market <unk> on <unk> for <unk> the following week 
 shearson a <unk> unit of american express co. did n't have enough time to update its market commentary so we decided to kill our strategy pieces says jack <unk> the head of shearson 's research department 
 the first thought some investors had was that a <unk> shearson must have been wildly bullish on stocks in its original commentary and that 's why it <unk> its pages 
 investors recalled that shearson last week had been advising that the market is still <unk> all the signs of a further advance 
 many other brokerage firms had similarly bullish views 
 but mr. <unk> insists that the N pages were n't pulled because they were too bullish 
 instead he says they were cautious and that was n't the message we wanted to deliver on monday 
 as mr. <unk> explains it we were raising some caution flags about rate rises in europe and concerns about the lbo market 
 and by late friday afternoon actually after the close we decided that was the wrong tone to take 
 with the market down we wanted to tell people to put their orders in on the opening 
 both before and after the friday plunge shearson has maintained a recommended portfolio <unk> of N N stocks N N bonds and N N cash

 china 's slide toward recession is beginning to look like a free fall 
 in a report on china 's <unk> economy the official state statistical bureau disclosed that industrial output last month rose N N from a year earlier the lowest growth rate in a decade for september 
 retail sales are <unk> while consumer prices still are rising 
 chinese and foreign economists now predict prolonged <unk> low growth and high inflation 
 the economy is <unk> hard says an asian economist in beijing 
 the slowdown is taking hold a lot more quickly and <unk> than anyone had expected 
 a lengthy recession if it <unk> would drain state <unk> and create severe <unk> for urban workers 
 experts predict the coming year will be characterized by flat or negative industrial growth rising unemployment and a widening budget deficit 
 unless the government suddenly <unk> course wages for most workers wo n't keep pace with inflation creating a potential source of urban unrest 
 the economy 's slowdown is due only partly to the <unk> program launched in september N to cool an <unk> economy and <unk> inflation 
 industrial output surged N N in N while inflation peaked last february at nearly N N 
 the slowdown also results from <unk> energy and <unk> shortages that force many factories to restrict operations to two or three days a week 
 in western <unk> countries recessions often have a bright side <unk> the economy to greater efficiency 
 in china however there is n't likely to be any silver <unk> because the economy remains <unk> primarily by the state 
 instead china is likely to shell out <unk> subsidies to its <unk> <unk> enterprises which <unk> up $ N billion in <unk> last year 
 nor are any of these inefficient <unk> likely to be allowed to go bankrupt 
 rather the brunt of the slowdown will be felt in the fast-growing private and <unk> township enterprises which have fallen into <unk> as china 's leaders <unk> an orthodox marxist preference for public ownership 
 when the going gets rough china <unk> the efficient and rewards the incompetent says a western economist 
 reports of an economy near recession come as officials prepare a major communist party <unk> for sometime in the next few weeks 
 the meeting is expected to call for heightened <unk> for two years 
 but with industrial growth <unk> and inflation showing signs of easing some voices may call for measures to pump new life into the economy 
 some analysts believe china soon will begin <unk> economic controls particularly by <unk> credit 
 that would benefit chinese enterprises as well as <unk> joint ventures both of which have been plagued by shortages of working capital 
 a dangerous buildup this year of billions of dollars in <unk> debts threatens if <unk> to bring the economy to a collapse 
 one sign of a possible easing of credit policy was the decision this week of people 's bank of china the central bank to <unk> $ N billion in short-term loans to pay farmers for the autumn harvest the official china daily reported 
 but while pumping more money into the economy would bring relief to many industries it also runs the risk of triggering another period of runaway growth and steep inflation 
 the cycle has been repeated several times since china began <unk> its planned economy in N 
 and because china 's leaders have abandoned plans to drastically reform the economy it is likely to continue analysts say 
 the statistical bureau 's report cited in china daily notes that industrial output in september totaled $ N billion a rise of just N N from a year earlier 
 output declined in several provinces including <unk> and <unk> two key coastal areas and <unk> the nation 's agricultural <unk> 
 production in shanghai china 's industrial powerhouse and the largest source of tax revenue for the central government fell N N for the month 
 nationwide output of light industrial products declined N N the first decline in N years a bureau spokesman told china daily 
 in an unusually direct statement the bureau spokesman recommended that state banks extend more credit to <unk> so that they can purchase manufacturers ' goods 
 this will prevent a slide in industrial production which will otherwise cause new panic <unk> the spokesman said 
 the N tax overhaul the biggest achievement of president reagan 's second term is beginning to fall apart and interest groups are <unk> up for tax <unk> all over capitol hill 
 real-estate executives are lobbying to ease <unk> rules 
 charitable groups are trying to <unk> the write-off for contributions made by individuals who do n't <unk> their deductions 
 big auction houses want to make <unk> eligible for lower capital-gains taxes 
 and <unk> lobbyists are quietly discussing the possibility of <unk> the investment tax credit 
 everything is up for <unk> says <unk> <unk> a lobbyist for mutual life-insurance companies 
 adds robert <unk> the head lobbyist for a variety of interests that want to protect the tax deduction for travel and entertainment expenses it appears as though the whole thing is wide open again 
 the catalyst has been the congressional move to restore <unk> tax treatment for capital gains an effort that is likely to succeed in this congress 
 other fundamental reforms of the N act have been threatened as well 
 the house seriously considered raising the top tax rate paid by individuals with the highest incomes 
 the senate finance committee voted to expand the deduction for individual retirement accounts and also to bring back income averaging for farmers a tax preference that allows income to be spread out over several years 
 as part of the same bill the finance panel also voted in favor of billions of dollars in narrow tax breaks for individuals and corporations in what committee member sen. david <unk> d. ark calls a feeding frenzy of special-interest <unk> 
 the beneficiaries would range from <unk> growers to rich <unk> to <unk> shops 
 to be sure the full senate facing a <unk> budget deadline last friday stripped away all of the tax breaks that were contained in the finance committee bill 
 but lawmakers of both parties agree that the streamlining was temporary 
 other bills will be moving soon that are expected to carry many of the tax cuts including both the capital-gains and ira provisions 
 there is n't any doubt that the <unk> of the <unk> code has been given a mighty <unk> says rep. thomas downey d. n.y

 referring to the chairmen of the senate and house <unk> committees he adds next year every special-interest group is going to be there knocking on lloyd <unk> 's door on danny <unk> 's door 
 many groups are n't waiting that long 
 just last week a house ways and means subcommittee held a lengthy meeting to hear the <unk> of individual cities companies and interest groups who want to open their own special <unk> 
 it 's a <unk> factory and the <unk> <unk> pretty good <unk> one veteran lobbyist who was watching the proceedings 
 even lobbyists for heavy industry one of the interests hit hardest in the N bill are encouraged 
 the return of <unk> tax breaks such as those for capital gains and iras creates more of a mood or a <unk> that is helpful for getting better depreciation write-offs or investment credits says paul <unk> a vice president for the national association of manufacturers 
 corporate lobbyist <unk> walker is planning a spring conference to discuss what tax changes to make to improve competitiveness 
 in reaction to proposed capital-gains legislation groups are lobbying to make sure they are n't left off the <unk> train 
 real-estate interests for example are <unk> an <unk> in president bush 's capital-gains proposal it does n't include real-estate gains 
 if there is going to be a tax scheme that <unk> lower treatment of capital gains they certainly want to be part of it says real-estate lobbyist wayne <unk> of concord associates 
 in the house-passed tax bill mr. <unk> got his wish real-estate assets are included in the capital-gains provision 
 but sotheby 's christie 's and the national association of <unk> dealers are still trying to get theirs 
 they have sent a letter to congressional <unk> asking that gains from the sale of <unk> also be given <unk> treatment 
 <unk> should continue to be recognized as capital assets the letter states 
 all of this talk is <unk> to the tax reform act of N 
 in exchange for dramatically lower tax rates the <unk> of that legislation sought to eliminate most of the <unk> deductions and credits that gave some taxpayers an advantage over others 
 the goal was to tax people with roughly equivalent incomes equally and to eliminate the many shelters that allowed the wealthy to escape taxes 
 two of the major ways that <unk> managed to <unk> these ends were to scrap the <unk> treatment of capital gains and to curtail the use of paper losses also known as passive losses that made many tax shelters possible 
 many other tax benefits also were <unk> away 
 this year congress with <unk> from president bush has been busy trying to put many of these same tax preferences back into the code 
 it appears likely that this year or next some form of capital-gains preference and <unk> restoration will be enacted 
 other tax benefits probably will be restored and created 
 the main obstacle is finding a way to pay for them 
 the <unk> act was a <unk> 
 they wanted reform and they got a revolution says overhaul advocate rep. <unk> <unk> r. ohio 
 so is the tax code now open game again 
 mr. <unk> thinks so

 <unk> chandler 's last pitch apparently was a <unk> 
 now robert parker author of several best sellers featuring <unk> a contemporary private eye in the marlowe <unk> has with the <unk> of the chandler estate been hired to complete the <unk> springs story 
 the result <unk> springs <unk> 's N pages $ N is an entertaining easy to read and fairly <unk> extension of the marlowe <unk> full of <unk> <unk> and california color

 philip and linda move into her mansion and ca n't keep their hands off each other even in front of the <unk> <unk> 
 but the <unk> have a conflict 
 he wants to continue being a <unk> private eye and she wants him to live off the million dollars she 's settled on him 
 that 's chandler 's <unk> 
 mr. parker <unk> it into a pretty satisfying tale involving <unk> springs high life hollywood low life and various folk who hang their hats in both <unk> 
 the supporting lineup is solid the <unk> is amusing and there 's even a <unk> by <unk> <unk> the good <unk> of previous chandler books who still does n't hesitate to have marlowe jailed when it suits his purposes 
 the style throughout bears a strong <unk> to chandler 's <unk> at its most <unk> down 
 all told mr. parker does a better job of making a novel out of this abandoned <unk> than anyone might have had a right to expect 
 but there are grounds for complaint 
 at one point the reader is two steps ahead of marlowe in catching on to a double identity <unk> and marlowe is supposed to be the pro 
 more <unk> there are several apparent <unk> 
 contact lenses tank tops <unk> openly working the streets of hollywood and the <unk> <unk> <unk> all seem out of place in the 1950s

 this year many stores are entering the christmas season in turmoil <unk> teller and b. altman parent l.j. hooker corp. is operating under chapter N of the federal bankruptcy code b.a.t industries plc 's healthy saks fifth avenue and marshall field 's chains are on the auction block campeau 's bloomingdale 's is also on the block 
 industry observers expect a wide divergence in performance 
 stores in a state of confusion are likely to fare poorly and to lose customers to stable chains such as limited inc. may department stores co. and <unk> department stores inc. which should do well 
 there are going to be very clear winners and very clear losers says cynthia <unk> a <unk> ross & co. retail consultant 
 says mr. <unk> i 'm looking for a <unk> christmas 
 economists expect general merchandise sales in the fourth quarter to rise N N to N N from year-ago figures 
 but mr. <unk> predicts that healthy stores <unk> mostly apparel could ring up gains of as much as N N to N N 
 troubled chains could see their sales drop as much as N N he believes as managers <unk> by fears about the future allow their stores to get sloppy 
 thin merchandise <unk> at the most troubled chains are also expected to hurt sales 
 catalog companies are likely to pose a bigger threat to all stores this year particularly in december 
 more than N catalog <unk> are promoting a low-cost federal express service that guarantees <unk> delivery of orders made by a certain date 
 traditionally consumers were concerned about ordering after the first of december because they did n't believe they would get it by christmas says <unk> <unk> chairman of the wine <unk> inc. which sells wine <unk> and accessories through the mail 
 using federal express delivery last year mr. <unk> says december was our biggest month 
 even sears roebuck & co. is getting into the act offering for the first time to have federal express deliver toys ordered by dec. N from its wish book catalog 
 k mart corp. chairman joseph e. <unk> <unk> up his outlook for the christmas season as not troublesome 
 he 's not predicting a blockbuster but he is more optimistic than three months ago because employment remains strong and inflation low 
 other retailers are also preparing for a <unk> holiday 
 philip m. <unk> chairman of carter <unk> <unk> stores inc. expects sales at department stores open at least a year to rise a modest N N to N N over last year 's totals both for his company and the industry in general 
 i 'm not looking for a runaway christmas at all he says 
 it is n't a real boom holiday season in our eyes says woolworth corp. chairman harold e. sells but it is n't going to be a <unk> either 
 mr. sells expects fourth-quarter sales at his company which besides woolworth stores includes <unk> and foot <unk> <unk> stores and other specialty chains to rise pretty much in line with its <unk> increases of between N N and N N 
 the estimate includes the results of new stores 
 a consumer poll conducted in early september by leo j. shapiro & associates a market researcher based in chicago also suggests a modest holiday 
 of the N survey respondents N N said they expect to spend less buying christmas gifts this year than last year while N N said they expect to spend more and N N said their gift budget would stay the same 
 the results are almost identical to shapiro 's september N numbers 
 retailers could get a boost this year from the calendar 
 christmas falls on a monday creating a big last-minute weekend opportunity for stores 
 most will stay open late saturday night and open their doors again sunday 
 but many consumers probably will use the extra time to put off some purchasing until the last minute 
 what you 'll hear as we get into december is that sales are sluggish predicts woolworth 's mr. sells 
 the week ending the <unk> is going to save the entire month for everyone 
 the spanish author <unk> jose cela won the nobel prize for literature yesterday a surprising choice but given the swedish academy 's past <unk> hardly the most <unk> and ridiculous <unk> handed out by the <unk> committee 
 in spain anyway the <unk> mr. cela enjoys some <unk> for the novels and travel books he wrote during the <unk> franco years the everyday poverty and <unk> atmosphere of which he described in <unk> direct vivid <unk> beginning with the family of <unk> <unk> N 
 unlike other writers who either battled the <unk> during the civil war or left spain when franco <unk> mr. cela fought briefly on the general 's side no doubt earning with his war wound some <unk> when he went on to <unk> a country with a high population of <unk> <unk> and rural <unk> <unk> <unk> through a <unk> land 
 still it was in <unk> editions that his <unk> first read his story of <unk> <unk> a field worker who <unk> his mother to death and has no regrets as he <unk> his end in a prison cell fate directs some men down the <unk> path and others down the road <unk> with <unk> and <unk> <unk> 
 the lucky ones <unk> out at life with <unk> eyes and <unk> with a face of <unk> at their <unk> <unk> 
 the others endure the hot sun of the plains and <unk> like <unk> wild <unk> 
 mr. cela himself was one of the lucky ones his fortunes steadily increasing over the decades he spent putting out some N <unk> novels short story <unk> and <unk> 
 these days he is as known for his flamboyant <unk> and the <unk> <unk> who shares his life as he is for his books 
 the man who wore out his shoes <unk> around <unk> in N describing in his travel book <unk> a la <unk> how he <unk> for food and stayed in <unk> <unk> now tours spain in a <unk> 
 of his N novels the <unk> N full of sharp <unk> of madrid life and centered on a <unk> run by <unk> <unk> a <unk> broad-based woman with <unk> little teeth <unk> in <unk> used to be available in english translated by <unk> cohen and published by <unk> press which now no doubt regrets <unk> its copyright 
 here is an <unk> 
 the <unk> woman walks on in the direction of the plaza de <unk> <unk> 
 two men have a conversation behind one of the windows of the <unk> on the corner of the <unk> 
 both are young one <unk> odd the other <unk> odd 
 the older one looks like a member of the jury for a literary award the younger one looks like a novelist 
 it is evident that their conversation runs more or less on the following lines i 've submitted the <unk> of my novel under the title <unk> de <unk> and in it i 've treated a few neglected aspects of that <unk> problem which 
 oh yes 
 will you pour me a drop of water if you do n't mind 
 with pleasure 
 i 've revised it several times and i think i may say with pride that there is not a single <unk> word in the whole text 
 how interesting 
 i think so 
 i do n't know the quality of the works my colleagues have sent in but in any case i feel confident that good sense and honest judgment 
 rest assured we proceed with <unk> fairness 
 i do n't doubt it for a moment 
 it does not matter if one is defeated provided the work that gets the award has <unk> <unk> 
 what 's so discouraging is 
 in passing the window <unk> <unk> gives them a <unk> simply out of habit 
 ashland oil inc. said it will take after-tax charges of $ N million or $ N a share in its fiscal fourth quarter ended sept. N 
 because of the charge ashland expects to report a loss for the fourth quarter and significantly lower results for fiscal N 
 the oil <unk> said it will report fiscal fourth quarter and N results next week 
 the company earned $ N million or $ N a share on revenue of $ N billion in the year-ago fourth quarter 
 for fiscal N ashland had net of $ N million or $ N a share on revenue of $ N billion 
 both revenue figures exclude <unk> taxes 
 the charges consist of a $ N million after-tax charge to cover cost overruns in ashland 's <unk> consolidated subsidiary a previously announced $ N million after-tax charge resulting from a $ N million settlement with national iranian oil co. and a $ N million after-tax charge from the previously announced sale of its ashland technology corp. subsidiary 
 ashland expects that sale to be complete next year 
 the charge for the <unk> subsidiary is for expected costs to correct problems with certain bed <unk> built for utilities 
 the charge will be added to $ N million in reserves established a year ago to cover the cost overruns 
 when president bush <unk> here next week for a <unk> summit organized to <unk> a century of costa rican democracy will he be able to deliver a credible message in the wake of the panamanian <unk> 
 undoubtedly mr. bush will be praised by some latin leaders prone to pay <unk> service to <unk> while they privately encourage more <unk> u.s. action to remove gen. manuel noriega and <unk> their countries from a sandinista <unk> 
 the panamanian affair is only the tip of a more <unk> <unk> 
 it <unk> in a bush administration decision not to <unk> the u.s. congress and avoid at all costs being accused of <unk> in the region 
 the result has been a dangerous vacuum of u.s. leadership which leaves central america open to soviet <unk> 
 the influence of the u.s. is not being felt in central america washington 's decisions do not respond to a policy and are <unk> from reality says fernando <unk> a costa rican congressman and former foreign minister 
 the disarray of the bush administration 's latin <unk> was evident in the failure of the organization of american states to condemn <unk> gen. noriega 
 faced with this embarrassment u.s. diplomats expressed confidence that the influential <unk> group of south american nations which gathered last week in peru would take a stronger posture toward the panamanian dictator 
 but other than a few <unk> on the <unk> gen. noriega went <unk> by that body too he was not even singled out in the closing statement 
 now mr. bush will come to costa rica and <unk> nicaraguan <unk> daniel ortega eager for photo opportunities with the u.s. president 
 the host costa rican president <unk> arias did not <unk> chile cuba panama or <unk> to the summit which was to be restricted to <unk> 
 however mr. ortega was included 
 formally upgrading the sandinistas to a democratic status was an initiative <unk> criticized in the costa rican press 
 even carlos manuel <unk> the presidential candidate for mr. arias 's national liberation party made public his opposition to the presence of nicaragua in a democratic <unk> 
 nevertheless the bush administration agreed to the dubious arrangement in july a few weeks before the central american presidents met in <unk> honduras to discuss a timetable for <unk> the <unk> rebels 
 according to officials in washington the state department hoped that by <unk> president arias it would gain his support to postpone any decision on the contras until after mr. ortega 's promises of democratic elections were tested next february 
 however relying on an <unk> critic of the reagan administration and the contra movement for help in delaying the <unk> of the contras was risky business 
 and even some last-minute phone calls that mr. bush made at the <unk> of some conservative u.s. senators to <unk> backing for the u.s. position failed to stop the march of mr. arias 's agenda 
 prior to this episode sen. christopher dodd d. conn. <unk> an open field <unk> a personal diplomatic mission through central america to promote an early <unk> of the rebels 
 visiting nicaragua he praised the sandinistas for their electoral system and <unk> the bush administration for not rewarding the sandinistas 
 in honduras where the contras are a hot political issue he promised to help <unk> some $ N million in assistance withheld due to the failure of local agencies to comply with conditions agreed upon with washington 
 aid was also the <unk> of the talks sen. dodd had with <unk> president <unk> <unk> mr. <unk> 's government is very much at the <unk> of u.s. <unk> and is forced to listen very carefully to sen. dodd 's likes and <unk> 
 it was therefore not surprising that close allies of the u.s. virtually neglected by the bush administration ordered the nicaraguan <unk> <unk> by december long before the elections 
 <unk> the <unk> accords were <unk> by <unk> the dodd plan 
 the individual foreign policy carried out by u.s. legislators adds to a confusing u.s. performance that has <unk> soviet initiatives in central america 
 on oct. N following conversations with secretary of state james baker soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze arrived in managua to <unk> nicaragua 's great peace efforts 
 there mr. shevardnadze felt <unk> to unveil his own peace plan the u.s.s.r. would <unk> a suspension of arms shipments to nicaragua after the february election if the u.s. did likewise with its allies in central america 
 he also called on nicaragua 's neighbors to accept a military <unk> guaranteed by both <unk> 
 the pentagon claims that in spite of moscow 's words east bloc weapons continue to flow into nicaragua through cuba at <unk> levels 
 since mr. shevardnadze 's proposals followed discussions with mr. baker <unk> arose that the bush administration was seeking an <unk> with the soviets in central america 
 this scheme would fit the arias plan which declared a false <unk> between soviet military aid to the sandinista <unk> and that provided by washington to freely elected governments 
 furthermore it is also likely to encourage those on capitol hill asking for cuts in the assistance to el salvador if president <unk> does not <unk> to demands of the marxist guerrillas 
 the sad condition of u.s. policy in central america is best <unk> by the recent end to u.s. <unk> of radio costa rica 
 in N the costa rican government requested help to establish a radio station in the northern part of the country flooded by <unk> of sandinista propaganda 
 recovering <unk> sovereignty was the purpose of radio costa rica funded by the u.s. and affiliated with the voice of america <unk> 
 a few months ago the bush administration decided to stop this cooperation leaving radio costa rica operating on a <unk> 
 according to news reports the abrupt termination was due to fears that <unk> <unk> could interfere with the peace process 
 in the meantime russia gave nicaragua another powerful radio <unk> which has been installed in the city of <unk> 
 it is capable of reaching the entire caribbean area and deep into north america 
 perhaps its loud signal may generate some awareness of the soviet <unk> being created in the <unk> thanks to u.s. default 
 the soviet <unk> in nicaragua is <unk> for costa rica a peaceful democracy without an army 
 questioned in washington about what would happen if his <unk> peace plan would fail president arias voiced expectations of direct u.s. action 
 a poll conducted in july by a <unk> affiliate showed that N N of costa <unk> believe that if their country is <unk> attacked by either nicaragua or panama the u.s. will come to its defense 
 but in the light of events in panama where the u.s. has such clear strategic interests waiting for the delta force may prove to be a dangerous <unk>

 holiday corp. said net income jumped N N partly on the strength of record operating income in its <unk> division

 the television units of paramount communications inc. and mca inc. are exploring the possibility of offering prime-time programming to independent stations two nights a week industry executives say 
 although such a venture would n't match the fourth network created by news corp. 's fox broadcasting co. mca and paramount may have similar ambitions 
 fox which also owns six tv stations provides programs three nights a week to those and other affiliates 
 paramount domestic tv and mca tv formed a joint venture last month named premier advertiser sales to sell advertising in programs syndicated by both companies such as star <unk> the next generation charles in charge and friday the 13th the series

 currently fox supplies programs on <unk> <unk> and <unk> although the company plans to expand to other <unk> 
 jamie <unk> president of fox broadcasting said we believe the partnership of fox its affiliates and advertisers is succeeding and will continue to grow 
 another fox official who declined to be identified said fox was n't pleased by the possible <unk> venture into prime-time programming 
 to make the venture work they would need fox affiliates he said 
 we spent a lot of time and money in building our group of stations he said adding that fox does n't appreciate another company attempting to <unk> its station lineup 
 fox said it plans to offer its stations movies theatrical and <unk> ventures probably on <unk> sometime next year 
 it is also planning another night of original series 
 paramount and mca according to the broadcasting executive plan to offer theatrical movies produced separately by paramount and mca for <unk> and perhaps a block of original shows <unk> 
 the executive said paramount and mca have also held discussions with <unk> industries ' broadcasting unit which owns five independent stations in cities such as los angeles san francisco and <unk> <unk> 
 a <unk> station manager said there have been no formal talks 
 i think it 's to fox 's advantage to be associated with the <unk> venture said michael conway station manager of <unk> the <unk> station that is a fox affiliate 
 mr. conway said the fox shows appearing on nights when <unk> shows would n't be offered could be <unk> on the programs produced by <unk> 
 michael fisher general manager of <unk> a fox affiliate in sacramento calif. said the real question is whether the <unk> offering is practical 
 it is n't 
 why would i consider giving up fox a proven commodity for an unknown venture 
 fox attracts a young audience with shows such as married with children its most successful series

 steel jackets of a type that may have prevented collapse of the columns of a <unk> stretch of the nimitz freeway had been installed on at least a small test section of the <unk> highway last year by california 's department of transportation employees familiar with the project say 
 the test project which reportedly survived tuesday 's earthquake was a prelude to a state plan to <unk> that critical section of the freeway with the steel <unk> 
 state engineers have made a preliminary finding that it was failure of the concrete columns <unk> and <unk> from the <unk> <unk> that was responsible for the collapse 
 the failure in oakland of the freeway segment known as the cypress structure was the <unk> aspect of the quake although officials were hopeful yesterday that the death toll there might be significantly lower than the N initially feared 
 <unk> out the <unk> is expected to take several days 
 red <unk> <unk> picked at the rubble while <unk> tried to break up some of the massive <unk> of concrete 
 giant yellow <unk> were <unk> up alongside the collapsed segment preparing to lift off chunks of the debris 
 in sacramento a transportation department spokesman said he could n't immediately confirm or deny existence of the test work 
 however he asserted that the department had n't <unk> the technology needed to <unk> the entire cypress structure 
 moreover other officials noted <unk> in transportation funding that the state has experienced over the years may have restricted the availability of funds for such a <unk> even if it were <unk> <unk> 
 knowledgeable employees said the <unk> which had n't yet been <unk> was part of a planned <unk> reinforcement of the cypress structure begun by the california transportation department several years ago 
 the cypress reinforcement project itself was part of an annual effort to shore up structures believed vulnerable to earthquakes 
 the state began such work after a N <unk> in southern california when numerous bridges collapsed 
 we had just finished phase two of the cypress project that involved <unk> a series of retaining <unk> designed to prevent sections of the roadway from <unk> as a result of seismic shock a state <unk> engineer said 
 after completing installation of the jackets on one frame of the freeway last year the state <unk> had sent the project over to its sacramento engineers to draw up a final design 
 knowledgeable employees said the project had been <unk> somewhat by the difficulty of designing the jackets 
 the procedure involves <unk> the concrete columns with steel then connecting them more <unk> to the <unk> <unk> 
 the employees also said the project may have been <unk> by budgetary concerns 
 one preliminary estimate put the <unk> cost at as much as $ N million 
 the collapse of the span has provoked surprise and anger among state officials 
 gov. george deukmejian who said he had been assured by state transportation officials that the structure could withstand an even larger quake called for an immediate investigation 
 i want to know who made the decision that it was safe for N people to use every day said richard katz a state legislator who is chairman of the california assembly 's transportation committee 
 he said he would <unk> hearings within two weeks 
 the cypress structure opened in june N and as such like many buildings in the san francisco bay area does not meet current building codes requiring considerably more steel support 
 the northern <unk> of the span lie in <unk> deposits that were of a type to have <unk> easily during the N quake 
 transportation department officials however said they were as surprised as anyone by the cypress destruction 
 they said previous earthquakes suggested that <unk> <unk> would stand up well although they were working on ways to bolster them 
 unfortunately there is only one laboratory for developing techniques to withstand earthquakes and that is an earthquake said <unk> <unk> san francisco district director for the transportation department 
 he said we know of no technology that exists anywhere in the world that would allow us to reinforce the columns

 democracy can be <unk> to politicians sometimes it forces them to make choices 
 now that the supreme court opened the door on the subject of abortion politicians are <unk> under the glare of democratic choice 
 their <unk> is a healthy sign for the rest of us 
 republicans are <unk> most painfully at least at first which is only fair because they 've been <unk> the most 
 so long as abortion was a question for litigation not legislation republicans could find political security in <unk> 
 they could attract <unk> voters by adopting the <unk> movement 's strongest position even as pro-choice republicans knew this <unk> little on an issue <unk> by the court 
 now it matters 
 much of washington thought it detected george bush in a characteristic <unk> on abortion the past week 
 only a month ago he 'd warned congress not to pass legislation to pay for abortions in cases of rape or incest 
 last friday after congress passed it anyway he hinted he was looking for compromise 
 was the man who once was pro-choice but later pro-life converting again 
 in fact mr. bush 's dance was more <unk> than <unk> 
 pro-life advocates say the white house never <unk> over the veto 
 christopher smith r. n.j. a pro-life leader in the house suggested a compromise that would have adapted restrictive language from rape and incest exceptions in the states 
 the white house never eager for a fight was happy to try which is why george bush said he was looking for flexibility last week 
 when democrats refused to <unk> pro-life republicans met at the white house with chief of staff john <unk> on monday and mr. bush quickly signaled a veto 
 amid charges of <unk> on panama and elsewhere the president was n't about to <unk> his most energetic constituency

 at the N gop convention abortion was barely discussed at all though delegates were evenly divided on the question of an anti-abortion constitutional amendment 
 ms. johnson made a <unk> statement to the platform committee but she was talking to herself 
 now many republicans are listening 
 they 're frightened by what they see in new jersey and especially virginia where pro-life gop candidates for governor are being <unk> on abortion 
 eddie <unk> a republican consultant says the two gop candidates could have avoided trouble if they had <unk> the issue first 
 in virginia marshall coleman and his running <unk> <unk> <unk> are both on the defensive for opposing abortions even in cases of rape or incest 
 but mr. <unk> adds the net loser in the next few years is the <unk> side 
 <unk> st. martin of the national right to life committee says exit polls from the N election had <unk> pro-life voters giving mr. bush about five more percentage points of support than pro-choice voters gave michael <unk> 
 but the supreme court 's opening of debate may have changed even that 
 gop <unk> neil newhouse of the <unk> group says polls this summer showed that the <unk> voters had about <unk> out 
 polls are no substitute for principle but they 'll do for some politicians 
 the republican danger is that abortion could become for them what it 's long been for democrats a divisive <unk> test 
 it 's already that in the bush administration at least for any job in which abortion is even <unk> an issue 
 oklahoma official robert fulton lost a chance for a senior job in the department of health and human services after <unk> activists opposed him 
 <unk> butler a conservative former congressman was barred from a legal services post after he gave wrong answers on abortion 
 even the president 's doctor burton lee has said on the record that he 'd love to be surgeon general but could n't pass the pro-life test 
 in the case of hhs secretary louis sullivan the <unk> test could yet damage issues important to other parts of the republican coalition 
 after mr. sullivan <unk> on abortion last year the white house <unk> <unk> by surrounding him with pro-life deputies 
 their views on health care and welfare did n't much matter though hhs spends billions a year on both 
 it makes only a handful of <unk> decisions 
 though democrats can <unk> at all this for now they may want to contain their <unk> 
 on abortion their own day will come 
 eventually even republicans will find a way to frame the issue in ways that <unk> pro-choice <unk> 
 does the candidate favor parental consent for <unk> abortions 
 the pro-choice lobby does n't 
 what about banning abortions in the second and third <unk> 
 the lobby says no again 
 democracy is forcing the abortion debate toward healthy compromise toward the <unk> middle 
 roe v. wade <unk> political debate so the <unk> <unk> 
 now the <unk> middle a moral majority of sorts is <unk> itself 
 within a few years the outcome in most states is likely to be that abortion will be more restricted but not completely banned 
 this is where the voters are which is where politicians usually end up

 but because of the uncertainty of the outcome of the suit mr. conner 's team has done little to begin <unk> up to defend its title 
 if you do n't know what the rules of the game are it 's hard to start your fund-raising or design said <unk> smith an official with team dennis conner 
 the conner team wo n't be able to negotiate with corporate sponsors until the suit is resolved and the race site is determined mr. smith said and the syndicate 's budget could easily reach $ N million 
 but spokesmen for both mr. isler and mr. conner say the formation of the new syndicate has to do with mr. isler 's desire to skipper his own team and begin planning now rather than any falling out between the two <unk> 
 mr. smith and a spokesman for the america 's cup organizing committee insist that the added competition for the <unk> 's spot will only improve the race 
 missouri farmer <unk> <unk> writing in the fall issue of the heritage foundation 's policy review about the proposed location of a <unk> incinerator in his county 
 of course i 'd rather have a computer software firm in my <unk> than a hazardous waste incinerator 
 but i 'd also rather live next door to an incinerator than to some of the <unk> farms i 've seen and <unk> in these parts 
 an incinerator is also probably better than having nobody next door on our farm there are four <unk> houses 
 on my <unk> drive to farm headquarters each morning i drive by another four empty houses 
 a community of abandoned <unk> failing businesses and crumbling roads and bridges is hardly a desirable one 
 the loss of N jobs by a depressed county in rural missouri is hardly of national importance except for this if the most environmentally safe way of dealing with a national problem can not be built in <unk> county what hope have we for dealing with the <unk> our economy produces 
 after all farmers here work with hazardous chemicals every day many of them the same chemicals that would have been destroyed in the incinerator 
 we know they are dangerous but if handled with care their benefits far outweigh any risk to the environment 
 just because stamford conn. high school did nothing when its valuable 1930s mural was thrown in the trash does n't mean the city no longer owns the work of art a federal judge ruled 
 the mural now valued at $ N million according to <unk> was <unk> in a trash <unk> in N by workers who were <unk> the building 
 the <unk> mural painted by james <unk> in N was commissioned by the federal works project administration 
 after the discarded mural was found outside the school by a concerned stamford graduate it eventually was turned over to <unk> hoelzer a professional art <unk> 
 throughout the 1970s stamford school and city officials made no effort to <unk> the mural 
 apparently the officials did n't even know the mural was missing until N when a researcher found that the painting was in mr. hoelzer 's studio and questioned school officials about it 
 in N stamford officials <unk> mr. hoelzer for taking care of the mural and demanded he return it as soon as possible 
 mr. hoelzer however sued stamford claiming that the city had abandoned the <unk> and that it had waited too long to reclaim it 
 but judge louis l. <unk> of federal court in manhattan ruled that the city could n't be <unk> for waiting too long because it did n't realize until N that its ownership of the painting was in dispute 
 the judge also ruled that the painting was n't abandoned because officials did n't intend for it to be thrown away and were <unk> that the <unk> had discarded it 
 mr. hoelzer did n't return phone calls seeking comment on the judge 's decision 
 the judge ordered that a hearing be held nov. N to determine how much the city should pay mr. hoelzer for his services 
 mary e. <unk> corporate counsel for stamford said the city has discussed several possible plans for <unk> the mural which <unk> various scenes from the great depression 
 she said the mural <unk> an era in stamford and in our country when this type of work was being done 
 the prices of corn futures contracts jumped amid rumors that the soviet union is keeping up its dizzying october buying binge of u.s. corn 
 those rumors were confirmed after the end of trading yesterday when the u.s. agriculture department announced that the soviets had bought N million metric tons of u.s. corn bringing their u.s. corn purchases confirmed so far this month to about five million metric tons 
 in trading at the chicago board of trade the corn contract for december delivery jumped N cents a bushel to settle at $ N a bushel 
 the soviet purchases are close to exceeding what some analysts had expected the soviet union to buy this fall the season in which it usually buys much of the corn it imports from the u.s. 
 that pace is causing some analysts to speculate that the soviet union might soon purchase as much as another two million metric tons 
 one sign that more soviet purchases are possible is that u.s. grain companies yesterday bought an unusually large amount of corn futures contracts 
 that sometimes signals that they are laying plans to export corn 
 by some estimates several grain companies combined bought contracts for the <unk> of roughly one million metric tons of corn 
 by buying futures contracts these companies attempt to protect themselves from swings in the price of the corn that they are obligated to deliver 
 rumors of soviet interest also pushed up the prices of soybean futures contracts 
 among other things the agriculture department is widely thought to be <unk> whether to subsidize the sale of soybean oil to the soviet union 
 on top of all this corn and soybean prices rose on reports that the midwest harvest was disrupted by a <unk> early snow storm that dumped several inches in parts of indiana and ohio 
 the harvest delays however are expected to be temporary 
 <unk> temperatures are forecast for next week said robert <unk> an analyst at farmers grain & livestock corp. chicago 
 many farmers used the jump in prices to sell their recently <unk> crop to grain <unk> companies 
 the heavy selling by farmers helped to damp the price rally 
 wheat futures prices rose slightly 
 in other commodity markets yesterday 
 precious metals 
 futures prices declined 
 a number of developments were <unk> interpreted by traders 
 december delivery gold fell $ N an ounce to $ N 
 december silver eased N cents an ounce to $ N 
 january platinum was down $ N an ounce at $ N 
 one <unk> development was the lower-than-expected increase of only N N in the consumer price index for september an analyst said 
 he noted that the core inflation rate which <unk> food and energy was also low at N N 
 other news that weighed on the market initial unemployment claims rose by N last week american telephone & telegraph co. will reduce its <unk> staff by N through <unk> the oil market turned weaker there was n't any investor demand for bullion and the dollar strengthened during the day putting pressure on gold 
 also the analyst said economic circumstances are such that both south africa and the soviet union the principal gold and platinum producers are being forced to continue selling the metals 
 both are in great need of foreign exchange and south africa is also under pressure to meet foreign loan commitments he said 
 putting it all together we have a negative scenario that does n't look like it will improve overnight he said 
 copper 
 futures prices recovered in quiet trading 
 the december contract rose N cents a pound to $ N 
 that contract fell a total of N cents during the first three days of this week mostly in reaction to last friday 's stock market plunge which prompted concern that it might signal a similar sharp slowing of the u.s. economy and thus reduced demand for copper a leading industrial metal 
 in recent days however there has been increased purchasing of copper in london an analyst said 
 some of this buying was by japan which has had its supplies sharply reduced by long production <unk> at the bougainville mine in <unk> new guinea highland valley mine in british columbia and the cananea mine in mexico which are major shippers to japan 
 the increasing likelihood that cananea and highland valley will soon return to production may have cut some of that purchasing but even if any of these mines begin operating soon their output wo n't be significant until at least the end of the year analysts note 
 so one analyst said even though the long-term production problems may be easing there will still be a significant need for copper over the next three months when inventories will remain relatively low 
 energy 
 crude oil prices ended mixed 
 west texas intermediate for november delivery fell N cents a barrel to $ N 
 but so-called outer month contracts finished higher 
 for instance december contracts for <unk> rose N cents to $ N 
 most energy futures opened lower following wednesday 's market downturn 
 but a flurry of late trading yesterday <unk> up prices 
 heating oil and gasoline futures ended higher as well 
 <unk> belli 's san francisco law offices may have been the epicenter of legal activity after tuesday 's earthquake 
 in the first N minutes after his office 's telephone service was restored yesterday morning N potential clients had called seeking the services of the <unk> king of <unk> 
 mr. belli like many other personal-injury lawyers suspects that the earthquake which measured N on the richter scale will generate enough lawsuits to keep this city 's personal-injury and construction lawyers busy for quite some time 
 suits are likely to be filed against engineering firms contractors and developers as well as against <unk> agencies 
 but lawyers looking to cash in on the quake may have a tough time once their cases reach a judge 
 experts on california <unk> law say <unk> <unk> government agencies in such cases are pretty <unk> 
 even claims against individuals and companies face significant <unk> 
 the major legal barrier is the principle that no one can be held liable for an act of god 
 for now says laurence <unk> <unk> of the <unk> california trial lawyers association the last thing we really need to worry about is whether anybody is going to get sued or whether they have liability or not 
 we still have people <unk> around in a <unk> in san francisco worrying about whether it 's going to rain tonight 
 but that wo n't stop plaintiffs ' lawyers from seeking a little room for <unk> 
 in san francisco they argue an earthquake was a near <unk> 
 therefore engineering firms construction contractors and developers can be sued for not keeping structures up to standard and government agencies can be held <unk> for failing to properly protect citizens from such a foreseeable disaster if negligence can be proven 
 my prediction is there will be mass litigation over errors and <unk> in engineering and contracting says stanley <unk> a well-known cincinnati plaintiffs lawyer 
 from what he saw on television mr. <unk> points out that interstate N which collapsed and killed more than N commuters suffered serious damage while surrounding buildings appeared to sustain no damage <unk> 
 he adds that they were aware of the <unk> for earthquakes and the san andreas fault 
 the flamboyant and <unk> mr. belli says he already has investigators looking into who could be held liable for the damage on the bay bridge and the interstate approaching it 
 we wo n't know until the smoke clears but yes we 're looking into it he says 
 mr. belli says he wants to know whether state or federal engineers or private companies could have prevented the damage 
 mr. belli who was at candlestick park for the world series tuesday night says he has hired civil engineers to check out his own mildly damaged building and to investigate the bridge collapse 
 defense lawyers perhaps <unk> say that plaintiffs ' lawyers taking such an approach will have little success in pursuing their claims though they add that the facts of each case must be looked at <unk> 
 a lot of this is going to be <unk> says <unk> j. <unk> a construction law specialist at <unk> <unk> & <unk> a san francisco law firm 
 plaintiffs he says will argue that damaged structures were n't built to proper design standards 
 but if defendants can prove that they met san francisco 's <unk> building codes that 's probably going to protect them mr. <unk> says 
 government entities continues mr. <unk> could be protected by the california government <unk> liability act 
 under the statute agencies are provided defenses that normally are n't available in the private sector mr. <unk> says 
 the legislature does not want to inhibit the unique government activities by <unk> public entities to liability 
 built into the statute are so-called design <unk> which are likely to protect government agencies according to mr. <unk> and richard covert a lawyer with the california department of transportation which oversees the damaged bay bridge 
 the state is protected when plans and designs for public structures were approved ahead of time or when structures met previously approved standards says mr. covert 
 he believes those defenses might well apply to the bay bridge collapse 
 nevertheless he adds i would n't get totally shocked if we get lawsuits out of the bay bridge 
 if there 's going to be a race to the courthouse it has n't started yet 
 mr. covert had to search through law books scattered on the floor of his office yesterday and mr. belli 's <unk> was <unk> with bricks 
 wednesday mr. belli 's staff was n't permitted into his office by city officials worried about their safety 
 he said he set up shop on the sidewalk in front of his <unk> office and helped victims apply for federal aid free of charge 
 in a news release issued by mr. <unk> the trial lawyers association also promised free assistance to victims 
 the association said it would monitor the conduct of lawyers and warned that solicitation of business is <unk> 
 what 's in a name 
 apparently a lot according to the british firm of deloitte haskins & sells 
 the british firm has begun court proceedings in london to prevent the use of the name deloitte by deloitte haskins & sells and <unk> ross & co. in england and the rest of the world 
 the british deloitte firm recently withdrew from the merger of deloitte and <unk> world-wide and joined coopers & <unk> 
 john bullock senior partner of deloitte in the u.k. said the decision to start these proceedings has n't been taken <unk> 
 mr. bullock said the british firm has used the name deloitte since N 
 in the u.s. deloitte haskins & sells was known as haskins & sells until N when it added the deloitte name of its british affiliate 
 john c. burton an accounting professor at columbia university 's graduate school of business said there 's a lot of <unk> involved in the name of an accounting firm with a long history and with roots in england where accounting <unk> the u.s. 
 although accountants are n't noted as being deeply emotional they really hold it all in said mr. burton former chief <unk> of the securities and exchange commission 
 j. michael cook chairman of deloitte haskins & sells international said he believes the legal action by the british firm to be without merit 
 mr. cook said that last june the international executive <unk> of deloitte and <unk> agreed to a world-wide merger 
 the merger is proceeding according to plan except as to the withdrawal of the deloitte u.k. firm he said 
 partners at other accounting firms say that the deloitte firm in the u.k. is filing the suit to get even with the merged <unk> firm for keeping major <unk> work in england 
 general motors corp. a deloitte audit client for example has agreed to keep its annual $ N million world-wide audit and associated tax work with the merged <unk> firm to be known as deloitte & <unk> in the u.s. 
 in england this would mean that the british deloitte would lose revenue for its audit of gm 's <unk> unit 
 the <unk> of deloitte 's affiliates in britain and the netherlands to coopers & <unk> will make coopers one of the biggest accounting firms in europe <unk> <unk> peat <unk> there 
 although coopers has n't been <unk> by other major accounting firms for a merger it is benefiting greatly from fallout from the <unk> merger 
 in new york harris <unk> general counsel of coopers said coopers was aware of the litigation but he declined further comment 
 he also declined to comment on the name that coopers would use in england if deloitte <unk> won its litigation to keep its name 
 coopers uses the coopers & <unk> name world-wide 
 william bennett the white house <unk> director accused local officials in the washington area of blocking construction of prison facilities to house convicted drug dealers 
 politics has essentially put up a <unk> to finding sites for new federal prisons mr. bennett said at a news conference called to report on his emergency assistance program for the capital 
 without more space to <unk> convicted criminals he added we will not win the war on drugs 
 mr. bennett declared in april that he would make washington a test case for how the bush administration would aid cities <unk> by heavy drug trafficking and violence 
 the drug <unk> claimed that enforcement efforts are working here <unk> at a slower and more <unk> pace than we would like 
 he acknowledged however that washington 's drug-related murder rate is <unk> high 
 the prisons are too crowded 
 drugs continue to be sold openly around schools parks and housing projects 
 mr. bennett declined to name the area officials who he believes have <unk> plans for building more federal prisons to ease washington 's problem 
 but other bush administration officials have criticized maryland gov. william <unk> for blocking the use of possible sites in that state 
 administration officials also have said that washington mayor <unk> barry has delayed consideration of sites in the city 
 in a letter to mr. bennett 's office released yesterday washington 's city administrator carol thompson complained that the drug <unk> had <unk> the amount of federal drug-related assistance provided to the capital 
 referring to mr. bennett 's claim that the federal government would provide $ N million in emergency federal support ms. thompson wrote our analysis was unable to even come close to <unk> that figure 
 of his successes in washington mr. bennett stressed that existing federal prisons have taken custody of N local <unk> 
 he also noted that the federal drug enforcement administration has established a <unk> task force responsible since april for N <unk> and more than $ N million in seizures of drug dealers ' assets 
 the defense department has lent the washington u.s. attorney N prosecutors and the federal bureau of investigation has provided crime laboratory facilities and training he added 
 what if it happened to us 
 in the wake of the earthquake in california and the devastation of hurricane hugo many companies in <unk> areas are <unk> the question of <unk> 
 some particularly in west coast earthquake zones are <unk> off their evacuation plans checking food stocks and <unk> employees of what to do if emergency strikes 
 others say they feel confident that steps they 've already taken would see them through a disaster 
 <unk> involves more than <unk> and fire <unk> these days 
 some big companies have teams of in-house experts focusing on safety and business <unk> 
 many companies in the path of potential disaster have set up <unk> offices in safe regions hoping they can transport employees there and resume operations quickly 
 that means making sure that copies of vital computer software and company records are out of harm 's way 
 some businesses like <unk> claim that even if they became isolated in a crisis they would be able to feed and care for their people for as long as five days 
 <unk> has to be the <unk> of your plan says <unk> <unk> manager of corporate emergency planning at atlantic richfield co. in los angeles 
 if you do n't save your critical people you wo n't be able to bring up your vital business functions 
 although arco 's head office more than N miles from the epicenter was n't affected by this week 's tremors ms. <unk> used the occasion to distribute a <unk> memo of earthquake tips to N arco employees 
 you need to capitalize on these moments when you have everyone 's attention she says 
 it was a good reminder that we all need to prepare prior to an event 
 the arco memo urges employees to keep certain supplies at work such as solid shoes and heavy <unk> to clear debris 
 it also recommends that employees be aware of everyday office items that could be used for emergency care or shelter 
 among the suggestions <unk> and men 's ties could be used for <unk> while <unk> wooden shelves might aid in breaking through office walls 
 arco maintains an office in dallas that would take over if payroll operations in pasadena were disrupted 
 two months ago the company set up a <unk> number based outside california to handle <unk> from employees about when they should report back to work after an earthquake or other disaster 
 the arco plan takes into account such details as which aspects of business are <unk> at certain times of the year 
 this way depending on when a quake might strike priorities can be assigned to departments that should be brought back on line first 
 at hewlett-packard co. the earthquake came just as the company was reviewing its own emergency procedures 
 we were talking about scheduling a practice drill for november says joan tharp a spokeswoman 
 then we had a real one in the afternoon 
 the palo alto calif. computer maker scrambled to set up a special phone line to tell manufacturing and support staff to stay home wednesday 
 sales and service employees were asked to report to work to help bay area clients who called with computer problems 
 hewlett-packard also called in its systems experts to restore its own computer operations 
 that means we can accept orders and begin getting back to normal says ms. tharp 
 prompted by an earlier california earthquake as well as a fire in a los angeles office tower great western bank in the past year hired three emergency planners and spent $ N <unk> a <unk> with communications gear to serve as an emergency headquarters 
 although officials of the savings and loan a unit of great western financial corp. used some of their new plans and equipment during this week 's quake they still lost touch for more than N hours with N branches in the affected areas not knowing if employees were injured or <unk> were broken open 
 some people flat out did n't know what to do says robert g. lee vice president for emergency planning and corporate security at great western 
 as it turned out bank employees were n't hurt and the <unk> <unk> the <unk>

 the publisher was able to register soaring quarter net income because of a <unk> gain on the sale of its cable-tv system

 analysts said the company 's troubles mirror those of the industry 
 retail advertising which often represents half of the advertising volume at most daily newspapers largely is n't rebounding in the second half from extended doldrums as expected 
 at the same time newspapers are <unk> by lagging national advertising especially in its financial component 
 dow jones & co. recently reported net fell N N a reflection in part of continued softness in financial advertising at the wall street journal and barron 's magazine 
 we expect next year to be a fairly soft year in <unk> advertising said john <unk> an analyst for lynch jones & <unk> 
 next year earnings will hold steady but we just do n't see a big turnaround in the trend in advertising

 fed officials probably wo n't drive down rates immediately mr. keith said 
 despite the inflation news several fed officials still fear <unk> pressures will intensify because they insist the economy is stronger than generally believed

 tuesday 's rout of a gop congressional hopeful in a mississippi district that has n't backed a democratic presidential candidate since <unk> stevenson is another reminder that at least at the federal level political ticket splitting has been on the rise over the past half century 
 in only one presidential election year prior to N did more than N N of the nation 's congressional districts choose a different party 's candidate for the white house than for the house of representatives 
 now that percentage routinely <unk> a third and twice has been above N N 
 as we know voters tend to favor republicans more in races for president than in those for congress 
 in every presidential election over the past half century except for the <unk> presidential <unk> the gop has captured a greater percentage of the <unk> popular vote for president than it has of congressional seats or the popular vote for congress 
 prior to N the pattern was nearly the opposite 
 what accounts for the results of recent decades 
 a simple economic theory may provide at least a partial explanation for the split <unk> displayed by americans in the voting <unk> 
 the theory relies on three assumptions 
 N voters can buy one of two brands when they select their political agents a republican brand that believes in the <unk> state and in the <unk> of private markets over the <unk> of public action and a democratic brand that believes in big government and in public intervention to remedy the excesses <unk> to the pursuit of private interest 
 N congressional representatives have two basic responsibilities while voting in office dealing with national issues <unk> actions such as casting roll call votes on legislation that imposes costs <unk> <unk> benefits on the population at large and attending to local issues constituency service and pork barrel 
 N republican congressional representatives because of their belief in a <unk> state are less willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than are democratic members of congress 
 if these assumptions hold voters in races for congress face what in economic theory is called a prisoner 's dilemma and have an incentive at the margin to lean democratic 
 if they put a republican into office not only will they acquire less in terms of local benefits but their selected legislator will be relatively <unk> to prevent other legislators from bringing home the <unk> to their respective <unk> 
 each legislator after all is only one out of N when it comes to national policy making 
 in races for the white house a voter 's incentive at the margin is to lean republican 
 although a gop president may limit local benefits to the voter 's particular <unk> such a president is also likely to be more effective at preventing other <unk> and their legislators from bringing home the local benefits 
 the individual voter 's standing consequently will be enhanced through lower taxes 
 while this theory is <unk> simple it appears to explain several things 
 first why ticket splitting has increased and taken the <unk> pattern that it has over the past half century prior to the election of franklin <unk> as president and the advent of the new deal government occupied a much smaller role in society and the prisoner 's dilemma problem <unk> voters in races for congress was considerably less severe 
 second it explains why voters hold congress in <unk> but generally love their own congressional representatives any individual legislator 's constituents appreciate the specific benefits that the legislator wins for them but not the overall cost associated with every other legislator doing likewise for his own constituency 
 third the theory suggests why legislators who pay too much attention to national policy making relative to local benefit-seeking have lower security in office 
 for example <unk> members of the house once the most vulnerable of <unk> have become virtually immune to defeat 
 the one exception to this recent trend was the defeat of N of the N freshman republicans brought into office in N by the reagan revolution and running for re-election in N 
 because these <unk> placed far more emphasis on their <unk> role spreading the reagan revolution in national policy making they were more vulnerable to defeat 
 fourth the theory indicates why the republican party may have a difficult time attracting viable candidates for congressional office 
 potential candidates may be discouraged from running less by the congressional salary than by the prospect of defeat at the hands of a democratic opponent 
 to the extent that potential republican candidates and their financial backers realize that the congressional prisoner 's dilemma game works to their disadvantage the republican party will be <unk> in its attempts to field a competitive slate of congressional candidates 
 fifth the theory may provide at least a partial reason for why ticket splitting has been particularly <unk> in the south 
 to the extent that democratic legislators from the south have held a disproportionate share of power in congress since N and have been able to translate such clout into relatively more local benefits for their respective <unk> voters in the south have had an especially strong incentive to keep such democrats in office 
 finally the theory suggests why republicans generally have fared better in senate races than in campaigns for the house 
 since local benefit-seeking matters more and national policy making matters less in the lower chamber of congress this is precisely the pattern one would expect if republicans are less willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than their democratic counterparts 
 is there any <unk> support for this theory 
 three pieces of evidence <unk> the key assumption that democratic legislators are more willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than their republican colleagues 
 first economists james bennett and thomas <unk> find that gop senators turn back roughly N N more of their allocated personal staff budgets than democrats do 
 to the extent that the primary duty of personal staff involves local benefit-seeking this indicates that political philosophy leads congressional republicans to pay less attention to narrow <unk> concerns 
 second if the key assumption is valid democrats should have lower attendance rates on <unk> votes than republicans do to the extent that such votes reflect national policy making and that participating in such votes takes away from the time a legislator could otherwise devote to local benefit-seeking 
 this is indeed what the data indicate particularly in the case of the house 
 the democratic house attendance rate has not exceeded the republican house attendance rate since N 
 finally as shown in the table democrats <unk> a higher proportion of their personal staffs to district offices where local benefit-seeking duties matter more and national policy making activities matter less relative to washington offices 
 an examination of changes in personal <unk> decisions in the senate between N and N when control of that body changed party hands moreover reveals that the personal <unk> differences noted in the table can not be attributed to the disproportionate control democrats exercise due to their <unk> status over other resources such as committee staff 
 an additional piece of evidence from the senate holding other factors constant such as <unk> advantages and regional factors the difference between popular votes for republican presidential and <unk> candidates in states conducting a senate election turns out to be a positive function of how onerous the federal government 's tax burden is per state a <unk> tax rate hits <unk> states harder 
 put more simply gop candidates for president are looked on more <unk> by voters than republican candidates for the senate when the prisoner 's dilemma is more severe 
 moreover ticket splitting appears to take the same <unk> pattern at the state government level as it does at the federal level 
 state government is more typically split along <unk> lines than the reverse 
 a <unk> <unk> investigation furthermore reveals that holding other factors constant the difference between a state 's <unk> vote going to the republican gubernatorial candidate and the republican share of the lower state house is a positive function of the state tax rate 
 in sum at both the federal and state government levels at least part of the seemingly <unk> behavior voters display in the voting <unk> may have an <unk> rational explanation 
 mr. <unk> teaches at the university of southern california 's business school 
 a house-senate conference approved a nearly $ N billion state justice and commerce department bill that makes federal <unk> for <unk> held in world war ii <unk> camps a legal <unk> after next oct. N 
 the measure provides no money for the promised payments until then but beginning in fiscal N the government would be committed to meeting annual payments of as much as $ N million until the total liability of approximately $ N billion is paid 
 the action <unk> earlier efforts to find offsetting cuts to fund the payments but is widely seen as a more realistic means of <unk> <unk> first authorized in N 
 the action came as congress sent to president bush a fiscal N bill providing an estimated $ N billion for the departments of labor education health and human services 
 final approval was on a N roll call in the senate which sets the stage for a veto confrontation with mr. bush over the issue of publicly financed abortions for poor women 
 <unk> an <unk> federal policy the measure supports medicaid abortions in cases of rape and incest but mr. bush has so far refused to support any specific exemption beyond <unk> in which the mother 's life is in danger 
 mr. bush 's veto power puts him a commanding position in the narrowly divided house but a vote to override his position could well pick up new support because of the wealth of health and education programs financed in the underlying bill 
 the measure before the conference yesterday funds the departments of state justice and commerce through fiscal N 
 an estimated $ N billion is provided for next year 's census and negotiators stripped a <unk> rider seeking to block the counting of illegal aliens 
 elsewhere in the commerce department nearly $ N million is <unk> for assistance programs under the economic development administration 
 and in a <unk> to the fall of house speaker james wright this year the conference voted to <unk> $ N million in <unk> <unk> funds for a fort worth texas <unk> project that figured in ethics charges against the former democratic leader 
 fiscal pressures also forced the adoption of new fees charged by federal agencies and an N N increase in the securities and exchange commission 's budget would be financed entirely by an added $ N million in filing fees 
 in an unprecedented step the measure anticipates another $ N million in receipts by having the federal bureau of investigation charge for <unk> services in civil cases a change that is almost certain to increase pentagon costs in processing personnel and security <unk> 
 the bill does n't include an estimated $ N billion in supplemental anti-drug funds for justice department and law-enforcement accounts that are still in conference with the house 
 but yesterday 's agreement would make it easier for state governments to handle the promised aid by deferring for one year a scheduled N N increase in the required state matching funds for law-enforcement grants 
 similarly the measure <unk> the current funding formula to promise smaller states such as new hampshire and delaware a minimum allocation of $ N million each in drug grants or three times the current minimum 
 the odd mix of departments in the bill makes it one of the more <unk> of the annual appropriations measures and the <unk> provisions attached by lawmakers run from $ N million for a fish farm in arkansas to a music festival in moscow under the united states information agency 
 lawmakers scrapped all of a $ N million state department request for the N <unk> in <unk> spain but agreed elsewhere to $ N for an oil portrait of former chief justice warren burger 
 senate commerce committee chairman ernest <unk> d. s.c. who also chairs the senate appropriations subcommittee for the department attached $ N million for an advanced technology initiative including work on high-definition television 
 his republican counterpart sen. warren <unk> r. n.h. has used his position to wage a legislative war with the conservative board of the legal services corp 
 an estimated $ N million is provided to maintain the program but mr. <unk> also succeeded in <unk> language seeking to curb the authority of the current board until new members are confirmed 
 the effective date of any new regulations by the current board would be delayed until oct. N next year and the bill seeks to reverse efforts by the corporation to cut off funds to service organizations such as the food research and action center 
 the bill also provides $ N million to meet u.s. contributions to international organizations and $ N million for <unk> activities 
 both accounts reflect significant increases from fiscal N although the amount for <unk> shows a N N cut from the administration 's request 
 mercury savings & loan association said it retained merrill lynch capital markets as its lead investment banker to advise it regarding a possible sale or other combination of the <unk> beach calif. thrift 
 mercury which has assets of more than $ N billion and N branches in california said the action to improve its regulatory capital position is related directly to new capital requirements mandated by recently adopted federal legislation 
 mercury also said it extended its two-year advisory relationship with montgomery securities of san francisco 
 mercury 's stock closed yesterday at $ N unchanged in composite trading on the new york stock exchange 
 watching congress sweat and <unk> through its annual budget <unk> fighting the urge to spend more we 're reminded of those <unk> movies in which the <unk> serial killer turns himself in to police and says stop me before i kill again 
 the members know they 're doing wrong but they need help to restrain their <unk> <unk> 
 arkansas democrat david <unk> <unk> his <unk> on the senate floor the other day after he 'd joined the finance committee 's <unk> pork-barrel <unk> i must tell you 
 i come to the floor tonight as one who ended up with a <unk> of <unk> matter 
 it was nothing more or nothing less than a feeding frenzy 
 he was turning himself in 
 frankly as i was walking back to get in my car i heard many many people opening champagne bottles and celebrating individual victories that some of us had accomplished in getting our little deal in the tax bill and <unk> at this person for slipping this in he said 
 as i was driving home i did not feel very good about myself 
 we can <unk> mr. <unk> 's moment of <unk> even as we understand that he and his <unk> need restraint <unk> they kill again 
 a good place to start the rehabilitation is a legislative line-item veto bill now being offered by indiana senator dan coats 
 the coats bill which already has N senate <unk> is n't a pure line-item veto because it would apply only to spending bills 
 instead it 's a form of enhanced <unk> giving a president a chance to <unk> or strike specific spending items that just go too far 
 under the proposal a president would have a chance twice each year to return a package of <unk> to the hill once when he proposes his budget and again after congress <unk> 
 congress would have N days to reject the package with a N N majority but then a president could veto that rejection 
 congress would then need the usual two-thirds majority to override any veto 
 the proposal would restore some discipline erased from the budget process by the N budget reform act 
 before N a president could <unk> or refuse to spend funds appropriated by congress 
 presidents kennedy and johnson were both big users of the <unk> power but congress saw its chance against a weakened president nixon and stripped it away 
 today a president can still send up spending <unk> but they 're <unk> unless congress has a guilty <unk> and changes its mind 
 this is like asking <unk> to feel <unk> about <unk> and naturally <unk> are almost never approved 
 in N president reagan sent N <unk> back to the hill but only N N of the spending total was approved by congress 
 senator coats 's proposal would let the proposed spending cuts take place automatically unless congress acts 
 the members could still try to serve their constituents with special-interest <unk> but the police in the form of a president would be there with a <unk> if they really get crazy as they do now 
 mr. coats plans to offer his proposal as an amendment to a bill to raise the federal debt limit before the end of the month 
 president bush has endorsed the idea and at least N sitting senators have voted to support enhanced <unk> authority in the past 
 we 're told senator <unk> is n't yet a <unk> but if he and his colleagues are serious about <unk> their <unk> they 'll sign up 
 business and civic operations <unk> back toward <unk> here as congressional officials estimated that the price tag for emergency assistance to <unk> california would total at least $ N billion

 the office of management and budget has begun looking into legislation to provide more funds for earthquake repairs

 the most extensive damage was in small towns near the quake 's epicenter N miles south of san francisco 
 santa cruz county estimates total damage at nearly $ N million 
 santa clara county has a running total so far of $ N million excluding the <unk> city of los <unk> 
 oakland officials were still uncertain about the magnitude of structural damage late yesterday a section of <unk> a <unk> highway collapsed in oakland causing a majority of the deaths resulting from the quake 
 san francisco mayor art agnos estimated that damages to the city total $ N billion

 it is likely to get as much as $ N million initially in additional funds and eventually could get more than $ N billion according to mr. fazio a member of the house appropriations committee 
 white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said there is enough money on hand to deal with immediate requirements 
 the bush administration has at its disposal $ N million in funds remaining from the $ N billion congress released for the cleanup after hurricane hugo 
 we feel we have the money necessary to handle the immediate short-term requirements mr. fitzwater said 
 he added that the office of management and budget the transportation department and other agencies are developing longer-term legislation that should be ready soon 
 much of the cost of cleaning up after the earthquake will involve <unk> highways and bridges

 california lawmakers want to eliminate temporarily a $ N million cap on the amount of federal highway relief for each state for each disaster as well as a prohibition on using the emergency highway aid to repair toll roads 
 in addition under the <unk> program the federal government provides N N of emergency highway aid for only the first N days of a repair effort 
 after that the federal share <unk> 
 for interstate highways the federal share normally would drop to N N of the cost of repairs and the state would have to pick up the remainder of the cost 
 but lawmakers want to extend the period for N N federal funding for several months 
 those changes also would apply to two areas hit hard by hurricane hugo south carolina and the u.s. virgin islands according to an aide to rep. fazio 
 meanwhile the fema announced a <unk> telephone number N to <unk> service to victims of the earthquake

 gerald f. <unk> and joe <unk> in washington contributed to this article 
 is an american secretary of state seriously suggesting that the khmer rouge should help govern cambodia 
 apparently so 
 there are no easy choices in cambodia but we ca n't imagine that it benefits the u.s. to become the catalyst for an <unk> process that could end in another round of <unk> in cambodia 
 now that vietnam appears to have pulled out its <unk> army the state department is talking again about accepting an interim coalition government in the <unk> capital of <unk> <unk> 
 the coalition would include the current <unk> <unk> sen regime the two <unk> resistance groups led by son <unk> and prince <unk> and the khmer rouge 
 the aim would be to end the guerrilla war for control of cambodia by allowing the khmer rouge a small share of power 
 the state department says that any khmer rouge participation would have to be minimal 
 the usual problem with including communists in interim coalition governments is that their <unk> and methods require they squeeze out everyone else 
 recall that nicaragua 's sandinistas came into managua as partners in a coalition government with <unk> <unk> 
 within two years the <unk> were <unk> or in prison nicaragua had gone communist and the sandinistas were building one of the biggest <unk> in latin america and threatening their neighbors 
 in <unk> when the western powers bowed to pressure for such a coalition it turned out they were opening the door to communist domination 
 even <unk> <unk> 's china began in N with a partnership between the communists and a number of smaller <unk> parties 
 what <unk> the scene in cambodia is that the current regime is already communist as are its vietnamese <unk> back in <unk> as are the khmer rouge who are the strongest of the three guerrilla groups 
 it 's not clear which crew of communists might prevail in a coalition government but the one good bet is that the <unk> would disappear 
 that would leave <unk> sen and the khmer rouge 
 the <unk> sen regime has sent thousands of <unk> <unk> to die of <unk> and <unk> while building cambodia 's equivalent of the berlin wall near the <unk> border 
 the khmer rouge however carry an <unk> record for <unk> <unk> 
 these <unk> caused the deaths by <unk> disease or execution of well over one million <unk> 
 the <unk> <unk> was so bad that the vietnamese <unk> in N was a <unk> form of relief 
 the world might want to believe that the khmer rouge ca n't still be such bad guys just as in the late 1970s it was reluctant to credit the reports of <unk> then taking place 
 but there is no solid evidence that the khmer rouge have changed 
 some of our sources in thailand say the notorious old khmer rouge leader <unk> pot has been <unk> up this summer in khmer rouge camps near the <unk> border 
 so it 's difficult to <unk> the notion that mr. baker is willing to accept conditions that would help the khmer rouge set up shop again in <unk> <unk> 
 true prince <unk> backs the idea of such a coalition at least for this week 
 but prince <unk> has backed all sorts of ideas over the years and done rather better by himself than by cambodia 
 nor should the u.s. worry much about <unk> china which still aids the khmer rouge 
 it 's time the state department recognized that china does not play by <unk> 's rules 
 for the u.s. to lend even the <unk> support to the most <unk> <unk> on <unk> 's bleak scene could only <unk> america 's allies elsewhere 
 it would be entirely rational for communist <unk> in countries such as the philippines or peru to conclude the following fight <unk> enough and the u.s. under the <unk> of <unk> might eventually help negotiate your way to victory 
 u.s. <unk> has done it before and it will likely do it again 
 the administration and congress have lately <unk> around the idea of sending military aid to cambodia 's <unk> 
 but now the possibility of diplomatic movement vietnam 's withdrawal the baker initiative has put that plan on hold with the <unk> that if the going got rough the u.s. would then <unk> the opposition 
 why the <unk> 
 at the very least the odds are heavily weighted against the prospects of preventing the khmer rouge and cambodia 's communists from ultimately moving against their opponents 
 when that day comes it would be particularly awful to know that the united states sat on military aid and deprived these people of the means to settle their fate with at least a little honor

 dell computer corp. squeezed by price pressure from its larger competitors and delays in its new product line said its per-share earnings for fiscal N will be half its previous forecasts 
 although the personal computer maker said it expects revenue to meet or exceed previous projections of $ N million for the year ending jan. N N earnings are expected to be N cents to N cents a share down from previous estimates of N cents to N cents

 in the third quarter last year dell had net income of $ N million or N cents a share on sales of $ N million 
 mr. dell attributed the earnings slide to new product delays such as a laptop scheduled for september that wo n't be introduced until early november

 they 've got a lot of different balls in the air at the same time observes jim <unk> a computer securities analyst with dallas-based william k. <unk> & co 
 mr. dell meanwhile concedes the company was definitely too optimistic in its expectations 
 product delays however have left dell <unk> by <unk> competition in its bread-and-butter line of desktop computers as powerhouse competitors compaq computer corp. and international business machines corp. price their pcs more aggressively 
 the result has been <unk> margins which have been further eroded by an ambitious research and development effort and rapid overseas expansion

 tuesday 's earthquake will depress local real-estate values in the short term and force companies to reconsider expanding in or <unk> to the bay area and california real-estate and relocation specialists said 
 few specialists said they expect the quake to have much of an effect on most california property values

 california prices were already coming down 
 this is n't going to help said kenneth t. rosen chairman of the center for real estate and urban economics at the university of california at berkeley
