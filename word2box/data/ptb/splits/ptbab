 emigration applications soared in N when britain and china ratified their accord on hong kong 's future 
 in N hong kong 's most <unk> year for a decade N left up N N from the previous year 
 last year N went 
 the government predicts that annual outflows will level off over the next few years at as much as N a projection that is widely regarded as <unk> low 
 a large number of those leaving are managers and professionals 
 while no one <unk> to know the exact cost of such a brain drain to the economy hardly anyone doubts that it <unk> a threat 
 when the economy loses a big portion of its work force that also happens to include its most productive members economic growth is bound to be affected says <unk> <unk> an economist with hang seng bank 
 while wall street is retreating from computer-driven program trading big institutional investors are likely to continue these strategies at full blast further <unk> the stock market trading executives say 
 <unk> to a mounting public outcry three more major securities firms bear stearns & co. inc. morgan stanley & co. and oppenheimer & co. announced friday they would suspend stock-index arbitrage trading for their own accounts 
 painewebber group inc. announced a <unk> on thursday from stock-index arbitrage a controversial program-trading strategy blamed by many investors for encouraging big stock-market swings 
 though the trading halts are offered as a sign of concern about recent stock market volatility most wall street firms remain open to handle program trading for customers 
 trading executives privately say that huge stock-index funds which <unk> wall street firms in terms of the size of their program trades will continue to launch big programs through the stock market 
 wells fargo investment advisers bankers trust co. and mellon capital management are among the top stock-index arbitrage clients of wall street trading executives say 
 these huge stock-index funds build portfolios that match the s&p N stock index or other stock indexes and frequently swap between stocks and futures to capture profits 
 they will do it every chance they get said one program-trading executive 
 consequently abrupt swings in the stock market are not likely to disappear anytime soon they say 
 in fact without wall street firms trading for their own accounts the stock-index arbitrage trading opportunities for the big funds may be all the more abundant 
 more customers may come to us now said james <unk> president of bear stearns <unk> 
 executives who manage these funds see the current debate over program trading as a repeat of the concern expressed after the N crash 
 they noted that studies completed after the N crash <unk> program trading as a source of volatility 
 the issues that are now being raised in classic <unk> fashion fly in the face of a number of post-crash studies said fred <unk> chairman of wells fargo investment advisers 
 a bankers trust spokesman said that the company 's investment arm uses stock-index arbitrage to enhance investors ' returns 
 officials at mellon capital were unavailable for comment 
 stock-index funds have grown in popularity over the past decade as pension funds and other institutional investors have sought a low-cost way to match the performance of the stock market as a whole 
 many money managers who trade stock actively have trouble consistently matching the <unk> 's returns 
 some stock-index funds are huge 
 wells fargo investment advisers for example managed $ N billion in stock investments tracking the s&p N at the end of june according to standard & poor 's corp 
 mr. <unk> said $ N billion of that is used in active index arbitrage 
 stock-index funds frequently use the futures markets as a hedging tool but that is a far less aggressive strategy than stock-index arbitrage in which traders buy and sell big blocks of stocks with offsetting trades in stock-index futures to profit from price differences 
 the 190-point plunge in the stock market oct. N has heightened concerns about volatility 
 and while signs of an economic slowdown softer corporate earnings and troubles with takeover financing all have contributed to the stock market 's recent weakness many investors rushed to blame program trading for <unk> market swings 
 the wall street firms ' <unk> followed their recent <unk> by several institutional investors 
 last tuesday kemper corp. 's kemper financial services inc. unit said it would no longer trade with firms committed to stock-index arbitrage including the three that later suspended stock-index arbitrage trading on friday 
 phoenix mutual life insurance co. and <unk> asset management inc. also cut off brokerage firms that engage in program trading 
 though it is still doing stock-index arbitrage trades for customers morgan stanley 's trading halt for its own account is likely to shake up firms such as kidder peabody & co. that still do such trades for their own account 
 morgan stanley has consistently been one of the top stock-index arbitrage traders in recent months 
 indeed morgan stanley 's president richard b. fisher said the firm is putting up money to form a group of regulators investors and investment banks to find out if stock-index arbitrage artificially <unk> stock-market volatility 
 we have to clear up these issues and find out what is present that is creating <unk> volatility mr. fisher said 
 there is no question that investor confidence in the stock market is critical 
 joining the call for some kind of study or regulatory action merrill lynch & co. recommended program-trading reforms late friday including higher margins on stock-index futures and greater regulatory coordination 
 separately mr. <unk> of bear stearns said his firm is working with regulators to balance margin requirements to enhance <unk> 
 margin rules determine the minimum amount of cash an investor must put up when buying a security 
 current rules permit investors to put up less cash for futures than for stocks 
 some observers say that different rules governing stock and futures markets are partly responsible for volatility 
 these rules they say permit faster and cheaper trading in futures than in stocks which frequently <unk> the two markets out of line 
 stock-index arbitrage because it sells the more expensive market and buys the cheaper one attempts to <unk> the link between the stock and futures markets and the adjustments are often abrupt 
 but <unk> trading rules allow the futures market to trade differently from stocks which invites frequent <unk> of stock-index arbitrage in the first place 
 there has to be better coordination on a regulatory basis said christopher <unk> director of trading at <unk> securities corp 
 one agency should have the authority over all equity products 
 like so many trends in the entertainment industry the current spate of rape <unk> on television seems to represent a <unk> of <unk> and <unk> 
 the former comes from the latest wave of political <unk> in hollywood especially around <unk> issues such as abortion 
 the latter comes from the perception on the part of many people in network tv that their only hope of keeping viewers from <unk> to cable is to fill the <unk> with an increasingly raw <unk> 
 put these together and you get programs about rape 
 the best of the crop was last week 's season premiere of in the heat of the night the nbc series based on a N feature film about a black philadelphia police <unk> in a small southern town 
 in the series <unk> <unk> howard <unk> and his wife <unk> <unk> johnson have settled in <unk> miss 
 because the show has acquired a sense of place by being <unk> on location in georgia this episode in which <unk> gets <unk> by an arrogant white <unk> does a decent job of <unk> the social <unk> of the crime 
 obviously it 's harder to establish a sense of place in a <unk> tv movie 
 but tonight 's offering settle the score N p.m. est on nbc does n't even try 
 this tale of a chicago <unk> returning home to find the man who <unk> her N years earlier is supposed to be set in the <unk> 
 but it 's more like an illustration of what ben stein describes in his study of social attitudes in the tv industry fear of violence and <unk> because of race or <unk> fear and lack of <unk> about the politics of small-town people produce a powerful wave of dislike of small towns in the minds of tv writers and producers 
 the writer and executive producer of settle the score steve sohmer is a graduate of yale who participated in a pbs <unk> aired this summer in which six members of the yale class of N <unk> about their lives since <unk> 
 at one point in the <unk> mr. sohmer who is jewish says he felt rejected by many of the <unk> and <unk> he met at yale 
 he quotes one student saying you 're just the kind of <unk> we <unk> ca n't stand 
 mr. sohmer <unk> that it was partly in response to such attitudes that he is now a <unk> on one of the two islands off the coast of america 
 but is <unk> in hollywood enough 
 not to judge by settle the score in which mr. sohmer seems to be settling a score of his own 
 of all the <unk> <unk> of small-town america i 've seen on tv this film is the most <unk> nasty 
 the sole sympathetic character is the <unk> daughter kate <unk> smith and she is <unk> only by virtue of having nothing in common with her <unk> a truly <unk> pack of southern <unk> whose grim existence consists mostly of growing <unk> and <unk> sex 
 i mean these folks are so <unk> that they blame pretty kate for the fact that when she was a <unk> someone tied her hands behind her back thrust her head into a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and beat her and then left her to die in a <unk> room 
 her pa howard duff is the kind of guy who while saying grace at the <unk> table <unk> at the word <unk> and <unk> at the daughter he has n't seen for two decades because he knows in his heart that she enjoyed what happened in the <unk> room and has been <unk> the same taste ever since in the <unk> of chicago 
 people like pa do exist of course 
 but in mr. sohmer 's <unk> he is but the tip of the <unk> <unk> 
 every man kate <unk> is either <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or all three 
 add the fact that any one of them including pa could be her <unk> and you have a setting that does n't resemble small-town america or even hollywood 's nightmare of small-town america so much as a <unk> <unk> <unk> like margaret <unk> 's the <unk> 's tale itself soon to be you <unk> it a hollywood movie 
 there are two exceptions <unk> jeffrey <unk> the local doctor who has always loved kate and lincoln richard <unk> kate 's <unk> but <unk> brother 
 <unk> makes <unk> passes at kate when she 's <unk> with anger and fear but we know from the outset that he 's not a member of the evil <unk> 
 how could he be 
 he 's the director of the local planned <unk> chapter 
 as for lincoln if you ca n't guess why he 's so sweet to his sister when everybody else <unk> her then i 'm not going to tell you 
 as for the women they 're <unk> 
 kate 's <unk> <unk> <unk> is a moral <unk> 
 her <unk> <unk> wright is a <unk> <unk> afraid that kate will <unk> all the married men in town including a particularly <unk> fellow named tucker whose idea of fun is to leave his wife at home <unk> to her <unk> and cigarette burns while he <unk> kate into a dance that consists of <unk> on her while trying to break her <unk> 
 at the very least it would appear that <unk> is a poor judge of <unk> <unk> 
 yet even these <unk> <unk> are not as bad as the moral <unk> at the heart of settle the score 
 in the <unk> episode of in the heat of the night we saw <unk> being attacked but we were n't invited to enjoy the <unk> 
 in mr. sohmer 's film by contrast we are urged to share the <unk> excitement of the <unk> creeping up on his victim as the camera <unk> kate in various stages of <unk> and <unk> on the sight of her <unk> body during frequent <unk> to the rape 
 at this point the truce between <unk> and <unk> gets mighty uneasy 
 take the scene in which kate stands naked by a <unk> window <unk> to her hidden <unk> look all you want 
 starting tomorrow i 'm <unk> you 
 or the one in which she and <unk> are <unk> in the city and after insisting on separate motel rooms she <unk> on his door to pour out her feelings about the rape wearing nothing but a <unk> and a <unk> <unk> 
 surely the question is obvious 
 with friends like mr. sohmer do the <unk> of hollywood need enemies 
 crossland savings bank 's stock plummeted after management recommended a suspension of dividend payments on both its common and preferred stock because crossland may not meet the new government capital criteria effective dec. N 
 in composite trading on the new york stock exchange friday crossland closed at $ N down $ N a N N decline 
 a spokesman said the savings bank may not qualify for the capital requirements because under the proposed guidelines its $ N million of preferred stock does n't meet the core capital criteria outlined under the new financial institutions reform recovery and enforcement act of N 
 he added that final guidelines to be published in early november will determine whether the bank is in compliance 
 crossland said it retained three investment bankers to assist it in developing and <unk> a financial restructuring plan 
 it would n't identify the bankers 
 additionally crossland reported a third-quarter loss of $ N million or $ N a share compared with net income of $ N million or $ N a share a year ago 
 a major factor in the third-quarter loss was the write-down of $ N million of goodwill 
 the spokesman said that the proposed guidelines caused crossland to revise its business objectives and consequently to write down the asset value of some previous acquisitions 
 crossland recorded an additional $ N million in loan loss reserves in the third quarter 
 net interest income for the third quarter declined to $ N million from $ N million a year ago 
 however non-interest income rose to $ N million from $ N million 
 third-quarter loan <unk> dropped sharply to $ N million from $ N billion a year ago 
 standard & poor 's corp. lowered the rating on crossland 's preferred stock to <unk> from <unk> and placed it on <unk> for possible further downgrade

 no but he 's endangered all the same his new <unk> on abc needs a following to stay on the air 
 abc has n't had much luck with shows featuring blacks in recent years and the producers of one new <unk> are a bit desperate 
 <unk> a show about a black ad executive who gives up the <unk> for a <unk> classroom is <unk> the ratings test 
 so producers <unk> and <unk> <unk> spun their <unk> and gathered names of black opinion makers to mount a direct-mail campaign 
 by wooing a core black audience they figure they might keep the show alive at least until the spring <unk> 
 using direct mail for a tv show is like fishing for <unk> with a <unk> hook 
 it just is n't done 
 but <unk> this kind of <unk> plea to black <unk> makes it even more unusual 
 still mr. <unk> thinks he can reach a good chunk of the three <unk> black homes he needs by mailing to the almost N blacks who form what he calls the <unk> 
 the <unk> is n't organized but you and i know it exists says mr. <unk> referring to the often <unk> small world of black professionals and community leaders 
 this is a very personal ethnic style mr. <unk> says 
 i want people in the barber shops and the beauty shops and standing in line at the <unk> <unk> to be talking about the show 
 i want white america to talk about it too but i 'm convinced that the <unk> is what 's happening 
 abc says it is aware of the producers ' action but the mailing was sent without the network 's blessing 
 the letter in fact takes a <unk> at abc for being a <unk> in black programming 
 meanwhile as the sunday evening show struggles to stay afloat against the tough competition of murder she wrote the <unk> idea is threatening to turn into a <unk> the <unk> apparently has inspired sample <unk> but <unk> are slow in coming

 gerald <unk> president and chief executive officer of the natural-gas pipeline and marketing concern said the company 's future growth is increasingly linked to decisions made by calgary-based gas producers 
 since deregulation of the market in N producers have become much more intensely involved in both transportation and marketing mr. <unk> said 
 it 's a matter of being close to those suppliers many of those companies do n't know us as well as they should 
 transcanada <unk> all gas that moves <unk> from alberta 
 that includes all the gas consumed in ontario and quebec along with the bulk of canadian gas exports to the 
 walter <unk> vice president of <unk> gas ltd. a calgary-based gas marketing concern said the industry will welcome the move 
 having more than a <unk> presence here should enhance communications and business relationships mr. <unk> said 
 since the cost of <unk> gas is so important to producers ' ability to sell it it helps to have input and access to transportation companies 
 the move which could cost transcanada as much as N million canadian dollars us$ N million in relocation and severance payments should be complete by next summer mr. <unk> said 
 all N toronto-based employees will be offered positions in calgary the company said 
 the company will save between c$ N million and c$ N million annually in office expenses and other administrative costs by moving to calgary mr. <unk> added 
 part of both the costs and the savings could be passed on to shippers on the transcanada pipeline through <unk> which are based on the value of the pipeline system and the cost of operating it

 but with sales growth sluggish and other men 's stores putting on the heat the venerable retailer can no longer afford such a <unk> attitude 
 so two weeks ago thousands of brooks brothers charge customers customers <unk> to wait for <unk> clearance sales got a surprise an invitation to come in and buy any one item for N N off 
 during the four-day promotion shoppers at the short hills n.j. store lined up to pay for <unk> items like coats and suits 
 that 's not all 
 <unk> from its newspaper ads featuring <unk> <unk> of a suit or a <unk> brooks brothers is marketing an <unk> image in a new campaign that carries the <unk> the surprise of brooks brothers 
 one color photo displays a rainbow of dress shirts tied in a <unk> another picture shows <unk> with bold designs 
 the message is loud and clear this is not your father 's brooks brothers 
 as part of its national ad pitch brooks brothers will show less <unk> women 's clothes moving away from its <unk> business <unk> 
 one ad shows a bright red <unk> <unk> with a black leather <unk> 
 and the ad copy is <unk> how can you be a wall street hot shot without at least one brooks brothers suit in your portfolio 
 brooks brothers hopes that shaking its <unk> <unk> will attract more young men and more women and change consumer perceptions about its range of merchandise 
 we have men who only buy their shirts and underwear here or younger customers who only buy their job interview suit here says william roberti chairman and chief executive officer of brooks brothers 
 we want them to buy more of their <unk> here 
 industry watchers agree that brooks brothers is long overdue in <unk> its <unk> image which has <unk> its growth 
 when acquired in may N by british retailer marks & spencer plc brooks brothers ' annual operating profit was about $ N million on sales of $ N million 
 mr. roberti concedes that since the $ N million takeover sales growth has n't been dramatic 
 for the N months ended march N operating profit at the <unk> chain totaled $ N million on sales of $ N million 
 as brooks brothers <unk> into the fashion fray it will be playing catch up 
 many <unk> especially ralph <unk> have <unk> in on the recent popularity of <unk> ivy league and english styles 
 in keeping with men 's broader fashion scope today businessmen are <unk> in english and italian suits that are conservative but not <unk> 
 the rigid ivy league customer brooks brothers ' bread and butter meanwhile is becoming <unk> 
 thus brooks brothers has lost customers to stores that offer more variety such as paul stuart <unk> new york and louis boston 
 brooks brothers no longer has a lock on the ivy league customer who is <unk> about his clothes says charlie <unk> president of the <unk> shop a traditional men 's store in cambridge mass 
 by making a break from tradition brooks brothers is seeking a delicate balance 
 if it <unk> fashion too much the shop risks <unk> its <unk> customers by <unk> value it risks <unk> down its <unk> <unk> 
 fashion industry consultants also question whether the company can make significant <unk> in its women 's business given that its customer base is less established and that conservative business dress for women is on the decline 
 brooks brothers ' aim is for N N of total sales to come from the women 's department up from the current N N 
 everybody <unk> that there are fashion cycles in classic merchandise observes carol farmer a retail consultant

 brooks brothers is also remodeling its stores 
 wednesday it will unveil a $ N million <unk> at its flagship store on madison avenue 
 with newly installed <unk> the store retains its signature <unk> look but is less <unk> 
 more shirts and <unk> will be laid out on tables instead of sitting behind glass cases so that customers can walk up and touch them mr. roberti says 
 because the biggest growth in <unk> is in casual <unk> brooks brothers is chasing more of that business 
 the entire second floor of its madison avenue store is now casual <unk> featuring items such as ski <unk> leather <unk> and a $ N <unk> baseball hat with the store 's crest 
 the centerpiece of the overhaul according to mr. roberti is the men 's tailored clothing department where brooks brothers has added new suit styles and <unk> 
 the perception out there is that we are very conservative and we only sell one type of suit mr. roberti says referring to brooks brothers ' signature <unk> <unk> suit with a <unk> <unk> and <unk> fit 
 but it now offers more <unk> versions and suits with a <unk> fit 
 it also plans to add suits cut for athletic men with broader upper bodies 
 next spring nearly N N of its suits will have <unk> <unk> compared with virtually none a couple of years ago 
 says mr. roberti we want to turn the customer on

 arthur price abruptly quit as president and chief executive officer of mtm entertainment inc. a los angeles production company that has fallen on hard times 
 mr. price N years old also stepped down from the board of tvs entertainment plc the british tv company that last year bought mtm producer of such tv programs as hill street blues and the mary tyler moore show 
 a tvs spokesman said he did n't know mr. price 's plans 
 james gatward tvs 's chief executive said in a statement that he will assume overall responsibility for mtm 's operations until a successor is named 
 industry analysts speculated that mr. price 's sudden departure may have stemmed from conflicts with mr. gatward 
 mr. price wanted to run the mtm business and may have <unk> selling the company to tvs suggested charles <unk> managing director of zenith productions a subsidiary of <unk> communications plc london 
 mr. gatward declined to comment and mr. price could n't be reached on friday 
 in the tvs statement mr. price said leaving mtm was a very difficult decision but added that it is now time for a change 
 the $ N million purchase of mtm represented an <unk> international move for tvs which then was about half the u.s. concern 's size 
 at the time mr. gatward said his friendship with mr. price had <unk> the way for its link with the small british company 
 but tvs stunned industry analysts last month by disclosing that it expected mtm to post an operating loss for this year 
 in that announcement tvs also said it was trimming production finance and hiring a new u.s. sales manager 
 mr. gatward has spent a lot of time since late september at mtm 's headquarters he eliminated three departments and fired six executives according to the tvs spokesman 
 further staff cuts are likely the spokesman indicated 
 obviously we are looking at making economies across the board

 merieux a vaccine and <unk> firm based in <unk> france is controlled N N by state-owned <unk> <unk> s.a 
 the canadian government previously said merieux 's bid did n't offer enough net benefit to canada to be approved and gave merieux an until <unk> to submit additional information 
 merieux officials said last week that they are highly confident the offer will be approved once it <unk> details of its proposed investments to federal regulators 
 both offers are conditional on regulatory approvals and enough shares being tendered to give the bidders a majority of connaught 's shares outstanding 
 <unk> merieux which already holds a N N stake in connaught said that at the close of business thursday N shares of connaught and c$ N million face amount of debentures convertible into N common shares had been tendered to its offer 
 at the close of business thursday ciba-geigy and chiron said N common shares had been tendered to their offer 
 at last report connaught had N million shares outstanding 
 separately the ontario supreme court said it will postpone indefinitely a ruling on the lawsuit launched by the university of toronto against connaught in connection with the merieux bid 
 in a statement prepared by lawyers for the university and connaught the parties said they agreed that as a result of reaching a c N million research accord it is unnecessary that there be a judgment on the merits of the case at this time 
 lawyers for the two sides were n't immediately available for comment 
 the university had sought an injunction blocking connaught 's board from recommending or supporting an offer for the company by merieux

 after days of intense but <unk> negotiations a federal judge last week threatened to convert william herbert hunt 's chapter N personal bankruptcy case into a chapter N liquidation 
 judge harold c. abramson raised the possibility after talks to end a <unk> between two major creditors failed and all three reorganization plans in the case ran into <unk> 
 if the case is converted to chapter N what remains of the oil <unk> 's <unk> estate now believed to have a value of less than $ N million would be sold off quickly with most of the proceeds going to the internal revenue service whose claim for $ N million in back taxes has priority in the case 
 hundreds of smaller creditors could get nothing according to attorneys involved 
 while admitting such a move would be devastating to most creditors judge abramson told a courtroom filled with nearly two dozen attorneys that he was concerned about the toll mounting legal bills will take on mr. hunt 's shrinking estate and about the fact that following voting by creditors none of the reorganization plans appeared to be viable in their present form 
 it would be a shame to have a chapter N after all the progress in this case said judge abramson 
 under chapter N of the federal bankruptcy code a company continues to operate under protection from creditors ' lawsuits while it works out a plan to pay its debts 
 under chapter N the assets of a company are sold off to pay creditors 
 despite his reluctance to take the latter step the judge indicated he would move quickly after hearing testimony later this week in the bitter dispute between manufacturers hanover trust co. and minpeco s.a. a minerals concern owned by the <unk> <unk> 
 the manufacturers hanover corp. unit which is seeking repayment of a $ N million loan has asked the court to give its claim priority over that of minpeco which won a $ N million judgment against mr. hunt his brother nelson <unk> hunt and other defendants last year in a case stemming from their alleged attempts to corner the silver market in 
 while claiming that penalties legal fees and interest have driven the value of its claim to more than $ N million minpeco has agreed to settle for an allowed claim of as much as $ N million 
 but even that is disputed by manufacturers hanover which in alliance with the irs contends that minpeco has already collected more than its actual damages from other defendants in the <unk> case 
 under <unk> from judge abramson a minpeco executive flew in from peru last week to talk directly with executives from manufacturers hanover on a settlement 
 despite long private sessions in both new york and dallas the two sides ended the week N miles and many dollars apart according to attorney <unk> ray who represents manufacturers hanover 
 meanwhile inside the courtroom the judge said he would fine attorneys for the two creditors $ N every time they referred to each other with terms such as <unk> or <unk> 
 all three major creditors the irs minpeco and manufacturers hanover voted against and effectively doomed a reorganization plan proposed by mr. hunt 
 a reorganization plan proposed jointly by the irs and manufacturers hanover was stalled by a negative vote from minpeco 
 the mineral concern 's own reorganization plan met a similar fate after opposition from the irs and manufacturers hanover 
 neither plan is dead however and the judge could force creditors to accept some version of them after ruling on the <unk> hanover dispute 
 meanwhile settlement negotiations continue between mr. hunt and the irs which has already reached a tentative agreement with nelson <unk> hunt 
 the two sides have been far apart on how much herbert hunt will continue to owe the government after his assets are sold

 when the economy <unk> in the mid-1970s akzo <unk> fell out of bed 
 <unk> overcapacity in the synthetic fiber business which accounted for half of the dutch chemical company 's sales led to huge losses and left akzo 's survival in doubt 
 it was n't until the early 1980s that akzo <unk> itself back to health 
 now as a new downturn in the chemical industry looms akzo says it is in far better shape to cope 
 investment analysts generally agree 
 aside from slashing costs and investing heavily in its plants akzo has spent N billion guilders $ N billion on acquisitions since N to give it better balance 
 during the same period the company has sold about N billion guilders of assets 
 the fibers business whose products go into <unk> carpeting and <unk> industrial uses now accounts for only N N of akzo 's sales 
 we have definitely become less cyclical <unk> bergsma executive vice <unk> said in an interview 
 still akzo has n't yet found a way to achieve another goal a large presence in the u.s. market for prescription drugs 
 mr. bergsma said prices for u.s. pharmaceutical companies remain too high making it unlikely that akzo will pursue any major acquisitions in that area 
 but he said akzo is considering alliances with american drug companies although he would n't elaborate 
 an indication of akzo 's success in <unk> itself will come thursday when it reports third-quarter results 
 analysts expect the company to show profit of about N million guilders up N N from N million guilders a year earlier 
 a bigger test will come next year if as many analysts expect bulk chemical prices slump in europe 
 maybe akzo can surprise the investment world a bit said <unk> <unk> an analyst at <unk> bank <unk> 
 he figures akzo is likely to be one of the few major chemical companies to show profit growth next year 
 the bank projects akzo will show per-share earnings of N guilders in N up from an estimated N guilders for this year and the N guilders reported for N 
 at james capel & co. in london analyst <unk> <unk> notes that akzo is less exposed than many of its rivals to the most volatile chemical products 
 for example akzo has only minor petrochemical operations is small in plastics and does n't make <unk> 
 thus while akzo <unk> less than many rivals from the boom of recent years in petrochemicals and plastics it has less to fear from the current slump 
 the company is exposed to bulk chemicals however 
 although <unk> prices have begun falling in the u.s. they are generally stable in europe mr. bergsma said 
 a decline may come in the first half of N he said but the market does n't appear on the verge of a severe downturn 
 to reduce the danger of such pricing cycles akzo has invested heavily in specialty chemicals which have highly specific industrial uses and tend to produce much higher profit margins than do bulk chemicals 
 akzo 's biggest move in this area was the N acquisition of <unk> chemical co. 's specialty chemical business for $ N million 
 in a less glamorous field akzo is the world 's biggest producer of industrial salt used as a raw material for the chemical industry as well as for such tasks as <unk> ice 
 akzo also makes products derived from salt such as <unk> and <unk> soda 
 in the fibers division profit remains weak largely because of persistent overcapacity 
 but akzo is still <unk> down it recently announced plans to eliminate about N <unk> jobs in the netherlands and west germany 
 although the <unk> and <unk> markets remain mostly bleak akzo has high hopes for some emerging fiber businesses such carbon fibers and <unk> extremely strong fibers used to reinforce tires and metals and to make such products as <unk> <unk> 
 akzo 's <unk> <unk> fiber is a distant second to du pont co. 's <unk> which dominates the market 
 mr. bergsma said world-wide industry sales of <unk> fibers are expected to total about $ N million this year 
 sales growth of N N a year seems possible he said and akzo expects its <unk> business to become profitable in N 
 akzo also has spent heavily on acquisitions in <unk> auto <unk> and industrial coatings 
 in august for example it completed the $ N million acquisition of reliance universal inc. a u.s. maker of industrial coatings for wood metals and plastics from tyler corp 
 mr. bergsma said akzo is likely to see strong profit growth from coatings as it <unk> cost savings and other benefits from its greater scale 
 for akzo 's drug business where profits have shown <unk> change for the past five years mr. bergsma predicted moderate profit growth 
 akzo is the leading seller of <unk> pills in europe but is still seeking regulatory approvals to enter that market in the u.s. and japan 
 mr. bergsma said akzo hopes to have approval to sell its <unk> pill in the u.s. in N 
 akzo also has small operations in diagnostic tests generic drugs and <unk> products 
 <unk> products are showing especially strong growth mr. bergsma said 
 among the leading products is a <unk> shot for horses 
 we 're sorry to see nigel lawson 's departure from the british government 
 he is a politician with the <unk> of true conviction as in <unk> <unk> exchange controls and in particular slashing the top rate of income taxation to N N 
 but in the end his resignation as chancellor of the exchequer may be a good thing especially if it works as he no doubt intends by forcing prime minister thatcher and her counterparts elsewhere to <unk> the genuine intellectual issues involved 
 the early <unk> we admit <unk> suggest so <unk> an outcome 
 the fleet street reaction was captured in the guardian headline departure reveals thatcher poison 
 british politicians divide into two groups of <unk> those with their <unk> cut and those <unk> the sky is falling 
 so far as we can see only two persons are <unk> with a dignity recognizing the <unk> of the issues mr. lawson and sir alan walters the <unk> of the chancellor 's difficulties who also resigned as personal adviser to mrs. thatcher 
 the problem is that on the vital issue of monetary policy and exchange rates conservative free-market economists divide into at least three <unk> camps 
 there are the strict <unk> who believe that floating exchange rates free an economy to stabilize its price level by stabilizing the monetary aggregates 
 there are the <unk> <unk> who seek to spread the advantages of a common currency through fixed exchange rates 
 and there are the <unk> <unk> who <unk> <unk> to balance trade flows 
 this is a problem not only for prime minister thatcher but for president bush as shown in the ongoing <unk> over the dollar between the federal reserve and the mulford treasury 
 in the british case mr. lawson is the <unk> thing in london to a <unk> <unk> 
 he not only slashed marginal tax rates initially <unk> fresh growth in britain but he wanted to regulate monetary policy by targeting exchange rates indeed joining the european monetary system 
 while no doubt agreeing with mr. lawson on everything else sir alan is a <unk> <unk> inclined to defend floating rates to the death 
 to make matters even more confusing the earlier u.s. experience made clear that mr. lawson 's tax cuts would have <unk> effects on britain 's international accounts and the value of sterling 
 they increased the after-tax rate of return and made britain a far more attractive place to invest producing sudden capital inflows 
 by accounting <unk> this had to produce a sudden trade deficit 
 as in the u.s. it also produced a sudden burst in the demand for sterling that is a surge in the sterling monetary aggregates <unk> 
 at this point the options were crunch money to stop the boost in the aggregates as sir alan surely advised and forget the soaring pound 
 to push the pound even lower trying to cure the trade deficit a policy britain has repeatedly proved <unk> 
 or to supply enough money to meet the increased demand and stabilize the exchange rate as the chancellor argued and ensure the <unk> of this policy by joining the ems 
 faced with a similar situation paul <unk> let the dollar soar though monetary aggregates also grew so rapidly <unk> issued <unk> warnings of inflation 
 but this <unk> the u.s. manufacturing sector laying the seeds of <unk> 
 mr. lawson though not allowed to join the ems chose to shadow the deutsche mark 
 he <unk> inflation along with rapid growth no doubt <unk> sir alan 's predictions in the prime minister 's mind 
 but more recently the pound has been falling with high inflation which has also seemed almost <unk> to the high interest rates mr. lawson deployed to stop it 
 so the british experience presents a genuine <unk> that reaches far beyond the <unk> of <unk> 
 we had been soliciting opinions on it long before mr. lawson 's resignation and offer some of the collection for the benefit of his successor and one-time deputy john major 
 to begin with we should note that in contrast to the u.s. deficit britain has been running <unk> budget surpluses 
 in pursuit of this mystery <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> need not apply 
 we should also add mr. lawson 's own explanation as we understand it 
 unlike the u.s. britain never achieved even a <unk> reduction in real wages 
 the wage <unk> which <unk> studies confirm is particularly high in britain gives its economy a structural bias toward inflation 
 inflation is easier to spark and harder to control 
 we should also concede that in the british experience the <unk> cause <unk> some of the credibility it lost in the u.s. experience 
 nearby paul craig roberts a distinguished <unk> with <unk> <unk> argues the case for sir alan 
 perhaps the fiscal shock of tax cuts is after all best absorbed by floating rates though of course in the event mr. lawson resigned over whether to support a weak pound not restrain a strong one 
 we recall that mr. roberts not only <unk> the chancellor for being too easy because of a desire to <unk> sterling but also led the chorus saying that mr. <unk> was too tight when he let the dollar rise 
 somewhere in between there must be a golden mean perhaps measured by <unk> but perhaps measured by purchasing power parity 
 the <unk> tend to think mr. lawson ran onto technical <unk> 
 in <unk> rates the choice of initial <unk> is crucial for example and perhaps he picked the wrong <unk> rate 
 for that matter perhaps he fixed to the wrong currency 
 we <unk> with mrs. thatcher 's reluctance to tie her currency to one <unk> by the domestic political <unk> of west germany 
 perhaps the shock would have been less if they 'd fixed to another <unk> <unk> <unk> economy 
 alan reynolds of <unk> adds his <unk> that the <unk> <unk> <unk> is the budget surplus 
 those who can shake <unk> ghosts out of their heads might recognize that the retirement of <unk> for cash is equivalent to an <unk> <unk> operation indeed it is the definition of an open market operation to expand the money supply 
 mr. reynolds also notes that since british banks have no reserve requirements high interest rates are less likely to curb inflation than to cause recession 
 we would add that in political terms mrs. thatcher 's problem was failing to decide between the chancellor and her adviser 
 in the end neither policy was followed and instead of learning anything we are left with a mystery 
 in particular <unk> a currency is anything but <unk> it is an open announcement that the exchange rate target has no credibility 
 all the more so when strong voices are heard opposing the policy 
 better to have a true <unk> policy just for the experience 
 so mr. lawson had to resign 
 in the end his move was sparked by remarks in <unk> from sir alan 's <unk> in the american economist a <unk> academic journal 
 but it was the underlying situation that became <unk> 
 what mr. major and mrs. thatcher will do now remains to be seen 
 they <unk> <unk> inflation and a sagging economy that is to say <unk> 
 this can not be solved by <unk> a further downturn reducing the supply of goods does not solve inflation 
 our advice is this immediately return the government surpluses to the economy through <unk> tax cuts and find some monetary policy target that <unk> both supply and demand for money which neither aggregates nor interest rates can do 
 this was the version of <unk> economics that in the late 1970s and early '80s worked in america and world-wide to solve a far more serious <unk> than <unk> britain today 
 ogilvy & mather whose declining profitability prompted its takeover by wpp group earlier this year will see its profit margins bounce back to the N N range in N said graham phillips the agency 's new <unk> 
 the ad agency 's pretax profit margins were slightly under N N at the time of the takeover according to analysts london-based wpp 's goal is to increase margins to N N 
 mr. phillips made his comments during an interview detailing his plans for the agency 
 <unk> the <unk> ogilvy veteran was named last week to succeed kenneth roman who is leaving by year 's end to take a top post at american express an ogilvy client 
 surrounded by <unk> of paper two computers and photos of himself <unk> and flying mr. phillips laid out several changes he hopes to make at the agency 
 first and <unk> mr. phillips said he hopes to improve client service 
 ogilvy under the <unk> mr. roman gained a reputation as occasionally being <unk> in its treatment of clients of <unk> what strategy a client should indeed must follow 
 and some of its top <unk> executives including mr. phillips were <unk> to the point they were <unk> with administrative duties with little time to see clients 
 but mr. phillips recently freed himself up to spend more time with clients by <unk> much of his administrative work to a deputy 
 he also plans to get to know clients that mr. roman was closer to such as <unk> brothers american express and seagram 
 the two men are planning joint visits to a number of clients to attempt to smoothly hand over the reins 
 clients want to see more of our senior people involved in the business not once a month but two or three times a week he said 
 mr. phillips also hopes to finally implement a reorganization announced earlier this year but put on hold by the wpp takeover 
 the reorganization is supposed to make <unk> shopping buying advertising public relations and design all in one place or ogilvy <unk> in <unk> a reality 
 under the reorganization ogilvy plans to name one executive on each account as a client service director to work as the client 's single contact for all those services 
 there is little or no integration of our work quality is <unk> there is no single focus mr. phillips complained to staffers in march when the reorganization was announced 
 now mr. phillips says he hopes to have the new system in place for several clients including american express american telephone & telegraph and ryder by year 's end 
 industry executives and analysts are divided on whether mr. phillips is up to the task 
 he is n't as well-known to clients as is mr. roman 
 under his watch office <unk> was often rampant in the agency 's new york operation and the office there has had a dismal <unk> record for more than a year 
 and while last week the agency hired a top <unk> executive bill hamilton to try to bolster its work graham has to get the revenue of that new york office moving says james <unk> an analyst with county natwest securities 
 the one thing mr. phillips clearly does have going for him is <unk> although it is n't certain if that will be enough 
 as mr. <unk> says the last thing they need is enormous disruption at the top and graham is obviously a long-term member of the ogilvy mafia as we call it 
 mr. phillips and mr. roman are indeed quite similar in substance if not in style 
 while mr. roman is a <unk> <unk> mr. phillips would rather delegate leaving him time for his interests outside the office 
 mr. roman by contrast seems rarely to cut loose at all although he did appear at ogilvy 's halloween party friday <unk> out in duck feet and a duck hat <unk> as a <unk> duck 
 mr. phillips said the company 's expected margin improvement will be all but inevitable given that the company 's profitability was dragged down this year by an expensive move to <unk> <unk> new new york headquarters 
 the move <unk> at about $ N million actually came in at about $ N million he said 
 but margins will be helped too by some other <unk> steps 
 ogilvy eliminated the mail room staff closed the executive <unk> room and after the takeover let go half a dozen financial executives 
 wpp which assumes financial control of its businesses in a <unk> way instituted a new financial system and plans to <unk> some floors in ogilvy 's new headquarters building to outsiders 
 the fact that the agency will now be part of a u.k. company under british accounting rules will also make the profit picture look better 
 <unk> 's klein steps down

 in an internal memo alex <unk> the agency 's chairman said mr. klein decided to remove himself to minimize negative reaction from prospective clients and others and to prepare for his defense 
 the fact that he is in the process of defending himself against the present charges could <unk> have an adverse impact on <unk> mr. <unk> wrote 
 he said mr. klein will return to his post at the end of the trial at which he will be <unk> 
 mr. klein will work with mr. <unk> on some of the agency 's joint venture activities and acquisitions while the case is pending

 comparable store sales for the quarter were up N N 
 the net loss for the quarter was $ N million against a year-earlier loss of $ N million 
 the loss in the fourth quarter of N reflected in part expenses for an unsuccessful bid for federated department stores inc. as well as the restructuring of some of its department store operations

 sales for both years reflect 12-month performances for each year of i. <unk> bullock 's and <unk> <unk>

 while our competitors are concerned with their financial viability and possible ownership changes we will be concentrating on buying and selling merchandise our customers need and want 
 mr. finkelstein is apparently referring to b. altman and <unk> teller two new york retailers that have recently filed for chapter N bankruptcy protection as well as the retail chains owned by financially troubled campeau corp 
 those chains include bloomingdale 's which campeau recently said it will sell 
 other retail properties for sale include saks fifth avenue and marshall field retailers now owned by b.a.t plc the british tobacco conglomerate 
 in his letter mr. finkelstein also referred to the recent san francisco earthquake 
 mr. finkelstein flew to san francisco the day after the earthquake and found that N to N of his company 's stores had sustained some damage including the <unk> of most windows at the i. <unk> store on union square 
 the volume and profit impact on our fiscal first quarter will not be positive but looking at the whole fiscal year we do n't see the effect as material wrote mr. finkelstein 
 rjr nabisco inc. said it agreed to sell its baby ruth <unk> and <unk> candy businesses to nestle s.a. 's nestle foods unit for $ N million 
 the sale at a higher price than some analysts had expected helps the food and tobacco giant raise funds to pay debt and boosts nestle 's N N share of the u.s. candy market to about N N 
 the candy businesses had sales of about $ N million last year which was roughly N N of total revenue for rjr 's <unk> <unk> unit according to a memorandum distributed by rjr 's owner kohlberg kravis roberts & co. to bankers last december 
 the nestle acquisition includes a candy plant in franklin park ill. which employs about N workers 
 the sale which had been expected is part of kkr 's program to pay down $ N billion of a $ N billion bridge loan by february 
 roughly $ N billion of that debt has already been repaid from previous asset sales and rjr expects to use another $ N billion from the pending two-part sale of most of its del monte unit 
 that sale however could still fall through if financing problems develop 
 thus it remains crucial for rjr to obtain top dollar for its smaller assets like the candy brands 
 louis <unk> jr. chairman and chief executive officer of new york-based rjr called the sale a significant step in the company 's divestiture program as well as a a strategic divestiture 
 since kkr bought rjr in february for $ N billion of debt it has agreed to sell nearly $ N billion of rjr assets 
 rjr 's executives have said they will <unk> with certain brands in particular that are n't leaders in their markets 
 rjr nabisco and <unk> <unk> will concentrate more on our own core businesses mr. <unk> said friday 
 baby ruth and <unk> are both among the <unk> N <unk> bars in the u.s. but rjr 's overall share of the roughly $ N billion market is less than N N 
 nestle 's share of N N before friday 's purchases is far below the shares of market leaders <unk> foods corp. and <unk> inc. which have about N N and N N of the market respectively 
 this means nestle is now in the <unk> business in a big way said <unk> <unk> publisher of <unk> <unk> <unk> magazine 
 for them it makes all kinds of sense 
 they 've been given a mandate from switzerland to expand their u.s. <unk> operations

 aetna life & casualty co. 's third-quarter net income fell N N to $ N million or $ N a share reflecting the damages from hurricane hugo and lower results for some of the company 's major divisions 
 catastrophe losses reduced aetna 's net income by $ N million including $ N million from hugo 
 last year catastrophe losses totaled $ N million when net was $ N million or $ N a share 
 the year-earlier results have been restated to reflect an accounting change 
 the insurer has started processing claims from the northern california earthquake nearly two weeks ago 
 but because these claims are more difficult to evaluate and have been coming in more slowly the company has no estimate of the impact of the earthquake on fourth-quarter results 
 in new york stock exchange composite trading friday aetna closed at $ N down N cents 
 in the latest quarter aetna had a $ N million loss on its <unk> line compared with earnings of $ N million last year 
 profit for its commercial insurance division fell N N to $ N million reflecting higher catastrophe losses and the price war in the property\/casualty market for nearly three years 
 however aetna 's employee benefits division which includes its group health insurance operations posted a N N profit gain to $ N million 
 third-quarter results included net realized capital gains of $ N million which included $ N million from the sale of federated investors in august and a $ N million tax credit 
 in the nine months net rose N N to $ N million or $ N a share from $ N million or $ N a share last year 
 out of the <unk> of <unk> are coming words of <unk> 
 here at a <unk> stadium near the black township of <unk> yesterday were eight leaders of the african national congress seven of whom had spent most of their adult lives in prison for sabotage and conspiracy to <unk> the government 
 here were more than N anc supporters gathering for the first anc rally inside south africa since the black liberation movement was banned in N 
 here was the state security <unk> poised to <unk> on any words or acts of <unk> let alone revolution 
 but the words that <unk> over the <unk> <unk> messages of peace unity negotiation and discipline 
 we stand for peace today and we will stand for peace tomorrow said walter sisulu the anc 's former secretary general who along with five of his colleagues served N years in prison before being released two weeks ago 
 some members of the huge crowd shouted <unk> peace <unk> 
 these are <unk> times in south african politics 
 the government and the anc the <unk> of enemies are engaged in an elaborate <unk> dance designed to <unk> each other to the negotiating table 
 pretoria releases the anc leaders most of whom were serving life sentences and allows them to speak freely hoping that the anc will abandon its use of violence 
 the anc leaders speak in <unk> of <unk> <unk> discipline hoping the government will be encouraged to take further steps such as <unk> nelson <unk> the most prominent anc figure and <unk> the organization 
 the government of president <unk> de <unk> is using this situation to improve its international image and head off further economic sanctions 
 meanwhile the many organizations inside the country that back the anc are taking the opportunity to regain their strength and <unk> their supporters even though the state of emergency which has severely curtailed black opposition remains in force 
 the result is that the <unk> and <unk> are happening 
 six months ago government approval for an anc rally was <unk> 
 equally <unk> is that the anc given the chance to hold a rally would extend a hand <unk> <unk> to the government 
 in a message read out at the rally <unk> anc president oliver <unk> who ca n't legally be quoted in south africa said the country was at a <unk> and that mr. de <unk> may yet earn a place among the <unk> of our country if he chooses a path of genuine political settlement 
 still this does n't mean that either the government or the anc is changing <unk> or that either has moved significantly closer to the other 
 the government may ease repression in some areas but it still keeps a tight grip in others 
 for instance it releases mr. sisulu without conditions yet his son <unk> a newspaper editor is restricted to his home much of the day and is n't allowed to work as a journalist 
 the anc <unk> to keep up pressure on the government 
 <unk> yesterday called on foreign governments to increase sanctions against pretoria and urged supporters inside the country to continue <unk> emergency restrictions and racial <unk> known as apartheid 
 we can not wait on the government to make changes at its own pace mr. sisulu said 
 because the anc remains banned both the government which approved the rally and the <unk> who <unk> it denied it was an anc rally 
 they both called it a welcome home gathering 
 nevertheless an anc rally by any other name is still an anc rally 
 the recently released leaders sat high <unk> a <unk> in one section of the stadium stands 
 behind them was a huge anc flag and an even bigger sign that said anc lives anc leads 
 next to them was the red flag of the outlawed south african communist party which has long been an anc ally 
 in the stands people <unk> anc flags wore anc <unk> sang anc <unk> and <unk> anc <unk> 
 today said mr. sisulu the anc has captured the center stage of political life in south africa 
 as a police helicopter <unk> overhead mr. sisulu repeated the anc 's demands on the government to create a climate for negotiations release all political <unk> <unk> lift all bans and restrictions on individuals and organizations remove all troops from the black <unk> end the state of emergency and cease all political trials and political executions 
 if these conditions are met he said the anc would be prepared to discuss <unk> its guerrilla activities 
 there can be no question of us <unk> abandoning the armed struggle he said 
 to date we see no clear indication that the government is serious about negotiations 
 all their <unk> are vague 
 <unk> a phrase from mr. de <unk> mr. sisulu said let all of us who love this country engage in the task of building a new south africa 
 when westinghouse electric corp. <unk> its massive steam <unk> plant in <unk> pa. three years ago it seemed like the company had pulled the plug on its <unk> power generation business 
 but now westinghouse is enjoying a <unk> in demand for both steam and combustion <unk> and may even join the growing <unk> of independent electric producers 
 and with its new venture with japan 's mitsubishi heavy industries ltd. announced last week it is poised to <unk> growing markets overseas 
 for the first time since the mid-1970s westinghouse this year has seen a significant increase in orders for power plants 
 most are from independent producers instead of regulated utilities and westinghouse believes it will ride a wave of demand stretching over the next six years 
 analysts agree predicting that the revived market could significantly boost westinghouse 's bottom line in coming years 
 westinghouse 's earnings could be <unk> enhanced in the mid-1990s or sooner says russell l. <unk> of salomon brothers inc 
 the company expects a need for N <unk> of new generation in the u.s. over the next decade 
 already this year it has received orders for four <unk> advanced combustion <unk> from florida power & light co. and for two <unk> plants from <unk> energy corp. among others 
 westinghouse 's own role as a supplier also is changing 
 in the past the company usually took <unk> equity positions in power plants it supplied as a <unk> to close deals 
 but last june 's <unk> that westinghouse would put up all of the $ N million to build a new <unk> plant could herald a new age 
 westinghouse 's plant will provide electrical power to the southern california edison co. and backup power and steam to the u.s. <unk> & chemical co 
 we have n't decided on a strategy yet but we could become an independent producer depending on whether we 're the developer or just the supplier says <unk> stern executive vice president of the company 's energy and utility systems group 
 at the same time westinghouse hopes its venture with mitsubishi will help fend off growing competition particularly in the u.s. from such european competitors as asea brown boveri ag siemens ag and british general electric co 
 under the agreement westinghouse will be able to purchase smaller combustion <unk> from its japanese partner and package and sell them with its own <unk> and other equipment 
 westinghouse also jointly will bid on projects with <unk> giving it an edge in developing asian markets 
 in addition the two companies will develop new steam <unk> technology such as the plants ordered by florida power and even <unk> each other 's plants at times to take advantage of currency fluctuations 
 even though we 'll still compete against mitsubishi we can also work jointly on some projects and we 'll gain a lot of <unk> flexibility mr. stern contends 
 the <unk> venture was designed as a <unk> transaction <unk> any possible antitrust concerns 
 westinghouse carefully <unk> the agreement because the justice department earlier this year successfully challenged a proposed steam <unk> joint venture with asea brown boveri 
 it is expected that the current surge in demand for new power will be filled primarily by independent producers which unlike utilities are n't regulated and therefore do n't need government approval to construct new plants 
 westinghouse expects about half of its new orders for <unk> to come from independent producers for at least the next six years 
 despite <unk> of the company 's <unk> and east pittsburgh plants the company believes it has sufficient capacity to meet near-term demand with its much smaller and more efficient manufacturing facilities in north carolina 
 still westinghouse acknowledges that demand from independent producers could <unk> if prices for fuel such as natural gas or oil rise sharply or if utilities which have been pressured by regulators to keep down rates are suddenly freed to add significant generating capacity 
 even if that scenario occurs westinghouse figures it is prepared 
 the company already is <unk> up for a renaissance of nuclear power even though it has n't received an order for a domestic nuclear plant in a decade 
 john c. marous chairman and chief executive officer says he expects a commercial order by N for the company 's <unk> nuclear power plant which is under development 
 once we see an order we expect it 'll be on line by N 
 among the things i learned covering the world series these past few weeks is that the richter scale which measures earthquakes is n't like the one in your <unk> 
 a quake that measures two on the richter is n't twice as severe as a one it 's N times worse 
 a three is N times N again and so on 
 that put the seven of oct. N in perspective for me 
 think i 'll buy one of those i survived <unk> after all 
 by <unk> standards the show that the oakland athletics put on friday and saturday nights in putting a <unk> swift end to the game 's longest short series rated somewhere between a N and an N 
 the boys with the white <unk> on their <unk> might not have made the earth move much but they certainly did some impressive things with <unk> 
 the pale <unk> propelled six of <unk> out of the unfriendly <unk> of candlestick park during the two games en route to N and N wins over the san francisco giants 
 combined with their two <unk> victories way back on oct. N and N the scores were N and N remember that gave them a sweep of the <unk> series 
 the joke here is that the giants lost by de fault 
 that 's <unk> correct but a <unk> unfair otherwise 
 they showed up but did n't or could n't challenge 
 they led for <unk> an inning in the four games and managed to stir their fans only once 
 that came in the seventh inning of game four when <unk> N they scored four times and brought their big heat will clark and kevin mitchell to the plate with one out and a <unk> on 
 but clark <unk> out to short right field and mitchell 's drive to left was caught on the warning track by <unk> henderson as N sets of <unk> <unk> as one 
 i went out to <unk> burns the a 's <unk> and told him that we were n't <unk> <unk> let this guy beat us said oakland <unk> terry <unk> of the decisive confrontation with mitchell the national league 's <unk> <unk> king 
 i told him to make mitchell reach for everything and that 's what we did 
 the ball he hit was n't a strike 
 if it had been he <unk> hit it out 
 but if the a 's had n't won in four they would have prevailed in five or six or seven 
 the best team won this series which is more unusual than it may sound 
 baseball ai n't football where the good teams beat up on the bad ones 
 the best baseball teams win six of N games and the worst win four of N 
 without becoming overly contentious allow me to suggest that several recent <unk> of the world according to us as in u.s. might not have ranked no. N in many polls 
 that list includes last season 's <unk> the los angeles <unk> who rode a <unk> home run by kirk <unk> and two <unk> pitching performances by <unk> <unk> to a <unk> <unk> over a <unk> bothered oakland crew 
 these a 's however got few grades as low as b on their N report card 
 they led the major <unk> in regular-season wins with N and <unk> the toronto blue <unk> four games to one for the american league <unk> before <unk> their <unk> rivals 
 the <unk> testimony to their domination of the <unk> <unk> came from giants ' manager roger craig after his team had fallen in game three to a <unk> <unk> that tied a <unk> series record 
 asked what he would do differently on the <unk> craig allowed that he might play his <unk> deeper maybe on the other side of the <unk> 
 the a 's offensive showing in the series got an a as in <unk> 
 their N total bases broke a record for a four-game set and their nine home runs tied one 
 eight oakland players hit <unk> with <unk> dave henderson getting two both on friday 
 <unk> henderson the <unk> <unk> man had nine hits and set or tied four-game series marks for <unk> N and stolen bases N 
 the sole a not to homer was cleanup <unk> mark <unk> their regular-season leader with N and he contributed five hits plus a <unk> <unk> play on a ground ball in game three that stopped a giant rally while the issue still was in doubt 
 think i 'll <unk> my image get this changed to a <unk> <unk> the big first <unk> saturday night <unk> the gold bat he wears on a neck chain 
 even with that power show though the oakland series ' star certified by the most valuable player award was a <unk> dave stewart 
 he shut out the giants on five hits in game one and allowed three runs on five hits in seven <unk> friday after the <unk> break caused by the earthquake 
 stewart 's honor was a nice note on a couple of grounds 
 one was that despite his N regular-season wins over the past three seasons in the land beyond the late news he has been <unk> by his <unk> <unk> and missed out on prizes that might have been his due 
 the other is that he 's an oakland native and lifted residents ' spirits by his visits to <unk> areas last week 
 afterward as the a 's <unk> their victory with beer they <unk> with traditional champagne <unk> in <unk> to the quake victims stewart said he thought his <unk> ring would <unk> his individual <unk> 
 give me four or five more series with these guys and i do n't care if i ever win a <unk> young he said in reference to baseball 's <unk> award 
 indeed the possibility of an a 's ring cycle <unk> a <unk> was a major topic of <unk> discussion saturday so much so that <unk> <unk> the team 's general manager felt obliged to <unk> it 
 people change teams change he cautioned 
 it 's easier to get worse than better in this game 
 he might have added an interesting historical fact the last series sweep by the cincinnati <unk> came in N which also was the first year of baseball player free agency 
 it was widely predicted that free agency would allow the glamorous big market teams to <unk> the best talent but quite the opposite has occurred twelve different clubs have won titles in the N seasons since its advent 
 the number includes such <unk> <unk> as well oakland 
 the rationale for responding to your customers ' needs faster than the competition can is clear your company will benefit in terms of market share customer satisfaction and profitability 
 in fact managers today are probably more aware of speed as a competitive <unk> than ever before 
 however for many managing speed does not come naturally 
 most of us grew up <unk> in the <unk> <unk> makes waste and do n't cut corners ideas that seem to run counter to the concept of managing speed says dean <unk> vice president for product integrity at grumman corp 
 but in the real world you learn that speed and quality are not a <unk> 
 speed is a component of quality one of the things we must deliver to satisfy customers 
 companies that actually market speed as part of their service train their managers to lead and participate in teams that increase speed and improve quality in everyday operations 
 managers learn to spot opportunities to increase customer satisfaction through speed and shift some responsibility for analyzing improving and streamlining work processes from themselves to teams of employees 
 one team at the federal express ground operations station in <unk> mass. focused on a particularly <unk> operation the morning package sort 
 every morning <unk> trucks arrive at the <unk> ground station from boston 's <unk> airport carrying the day 's package load 
 in peak periods that load may include N pieces 
 the packages must be <unk> quickly and distributed to smaller vans for delivery so <unk> can be on the road by N 
 no customer is present at the morning package sort but the process is nevertheless critical to customer satisfaction 
 we 're committed to deliver the customer 's package by a stated time usually N notes glenn <unk> a federal express <unk> who led the <unk> team 
 the sooner our vans hit the road each morning the easier it is for us to fulfill that obligation 
 following a <unk> formula used by teams throughout federal express members of the <unk> team monitored their morning routine carefully noting where and when the work group 's resources were used effectively and where they were idle waiting for others <unk> in the process to send packages their way 
 we suspected there was <unk> built into our process 
 but we did n't know just where it was until we completed our data gathering mr. <unk> says 
 we used the data to <unk> our <unk> system and put our resources where they could do the most good 
 the team even created a points system to identify those <unk> and <unk> that were doing the most to reduce <unk> cycle time 
 winners of the friendly competition earn a <unk> dinner out with their spouses 
 monitoring shows that the <unk> team 's new system really does reduce cycle time for the morning package sort reports james <unk> chief operating officer at federal express 
 the vans leave at least N minutes earlier on average than they used to 
 and service levels have increased to the point where they 're consistently above N N 
 a <unk> team at union carbide 's <unk> n.y. facility which produces <unk> plants followed a similar path to reduce manufacturing cycle time 
 the team included <unk> from the shop floor as well as engineering scheduling and purchasing personnel reports alan <unk> director of quality 
 first they produced a <unk> detailing the process by which an <unk> plant actually gets built 
 then they identified <unk> in the process 
 the <unk> team determined that <unk> for <unk> were the main problem and identified which kinds of delays involved critical <unk> and which were less critical or could be handled by workers already on the line 
 the team then proposed modifications in their work process to management 
 the <unk> manufacturing process benefits our customers in at least two ways mr. <unk> concludes 
 first we have better quality assurance than ever because the people building the product have taken on more responsibility for the quality of their own work 
 second we trimmed more than a month off the time required to deliver a finished product 
 at grumman 's aircraft systems division a <unk> team reduced the cycle time required to produce a new business proposal for an important government contract 
 the team was composed of representatives from engineering manufacturing corporate estimating flight test material quality control and other departments 
 we needed contributions from all these departments to generate the proposal says carl <unk> <unk> manager for grumman 's <unk> combat aircraft program 
 but instead of gathering their input <unk> we formed the team which reached consensus on the proposal objectives and produced a statement of work to guide all the functions that were involved 
 armed with this shared understanding and <unk> background information each department developed its specialized contribution to the proposal <unk> data and cost estimates on a closely managed schedule 
 we cleared up questions and <unk> very quickly because the people who had the skills and perspective required to resolve them were part of the task team mr. <unk> explains 
 the team trimmed more than two months from the cycle time previously required to develop comparable proposals 
 the team eliminated the crisis mentality that proposal deadlines can generate 
 the result was a more <unk> complete and competitive proposal mr. <unk> concludes 
 the successes achieved at federal express union carbide and grumman suggest that managing speed may be an <unk> source of competitive advantage 
 managers in all three companies recognize speed as a component of quality and a key to customer satisfaction 
 they effectively lead team efforts to reduce cycle time 
 and they prepare all their people to increase the speed and improve the quality of their own work 
 mr. <unk> is president of <unk> a consulting firm in burlington mass 
 home taping of <unk> music cuts into record industry revenues but banning home taping would hurt consumers even more 
 that 's the conclusion of an independent report prepared by the office of technology assessment at the request of the house and senate judiciary committees 
 the report is to be released today 
 the report says the availability of such advanced <unk> recording equipment as <unk> recorders does n't seem to increase the quantity of home copying 
 that finding the report says <unk> doubt on the record industry 's <unk> that the new generation of digital recording equipment will inevitably lead to wholesale abuse of <unk> material by home <unk> 
 the longstanding position of the recording industry association of america a trade group based in washington d.c. is that record companies performers <unk> and music publishers need to be <unk> by <unk> fees on the sale of blank tapes and recording equipment to make up for royalties lost to home taping 
 i think it is a <unk> in the <unk> in any royalty tax proposal says gary shapiro vice president for government and legal affairs of the electronic industries association in washington 
 what the report shows is everything we 've been saying for the past eight or nine years that audio taping is the best thing to happen for the recording industry 
 the people who tape the most buy the most 
 <unk> <unk> a <unk> for <unk> says her organization has n't received a copy of the completed report yet and has no immediate comment 
 a recent agreement between the recording industry and electronics manufacturers requires that any digital audio tape or <unk> recorder sold in the u.s. have a <unk> device that restricts its ability to make second copies from <unk> tape copies of digital compact disks 
 but the disappointing sales of <unk> machines here and abroad so far have not seemed to warrant the three years of legal <unk> that went into the agreement 
 under current copyright laws it is considered fair use to <unk> <unk> material for one 's personal use or for use by one 's family or friends while copying for purposes of resale or profit is prohibited 
 a survey contained in the <unk> report copyright and home copying technology challenges the law found that most people consider home copying for such personal use a right a right moreover that was exercised by N N of americans over the age of N in the past year 
 the study says that the <unk> legal status of home copying makes it appropriate to examine the effects on consumers as well as on industry 
 reports by the office of technology assessment do n't <unk> any specific legislative action but suggest a range of options that congress may pursue 
 the study also says that advent of new communications technologies makes an explicit congressional definition of the legal status of home copying more desirable in order to reduce legal and market uncertainties and to prevent de <unk> changes to copyright law through technology and says that finding an appropriate balance of <unk> and benefits is a political decision not a technical one 
 switzerland 's most famous raider says he is n't one 
 werner k. rey believes fortunes are made by being friendly 
 and in little more than a decade of being friendly and at the same time <unk> the <unk> swiss business community with some <unk> <unk> and dealing the <unk> mr. rey has grown from a modest banker to a billionaire 
 he achieved this in part with an <unk> talent for getting his foot <unk> in the door of established european companies 
 his latest coup september 's <unk> of the five billion <unk> $ N billion merger between <unk> s.a. the world 's second-largest temporary employment agency and <unk> international s.a. a <unk> <unk> company 
 shareholders must approve the merger at general meetings of the two companies in late november 
 but approval is almost certain since mr. rey and a friendly <unk> management are in control 
 after the transaction mr. rey estimates the value of his N N stake in the new company to be held by his omni holding ag will be about N billion swiss francs 
 this will be his return on an original investment of between N million swiss francs and N million swiss francs 
 mr. rey bought a controlling stake in <unk> for N million swiss francs in N building up the <unk> engineering company with european and u.s. acquisitions 
 i like to succeed says mr. rey during a recent morning of working at home which he also likes 
 home is an estate with green <unk> opening onto lake geneva and a <unk> house whose rooms <unk> the water and offer a view of the french <unk> 
 in the corner of his reception room is a delicate <unk> desk <unk> high with <unk> 
 there is a small <unk> on the wall 
 <unk> magazine <unk> lists mr. rey as having a fortune of about N billion swiss francs 
 writes <unk> no one in switzerland ever came so far so fast 
 he was simply the first in this country to realize that <unk> were just lying around waiting to be picked up 
 in short rey found companies with weak earnings but rich assets 
 however the swiss financial press in general as well as many analysts have had a hard time making up their minds about mr. rey and his <unk> ways 
 for switzerland 's most prestigious newspaper <unk> <unk> <unk> mr. rey seems <unk> to remain the former bally raider an image that has proved hard to overcome 
 in N as an <unk> in the eyes of switzerland 's establishment mr. rey laid the foundations of his <unk> <unk> with an <unk> <unk> on bally the country 's traditional <unk> 
 sitting <unk> a banker at a <unk> in london where he was working as a financial consultant he learned that a large <unk> of bally 's shares was up for sale 
 looking into bally he could hardly believe what he saw a company with enormous real-estate holdings in major european cities and a market capitalization of N million swiss francs it had N employees 
 investing four million swiss francs earned from his financial transactions and two million swiss francs from his parents and his wife mr. rey acquired N N of bally 's shares 
 but such tactics were <unk> to switzerland in N and still are n't common because of share restrictions that companies are allowed to maintain 
 eventually mr. rey was forced to sell his bally shares to the weapons maker <unk> holding ag as establishment pressure grew on this hostile move into the swiss old boys ' network 
 mr. rey made N million swiss francs on the sale 
 bally was not an unfriendly takeover he insists 
 buying from willing shareholders makes an unfriendly takeover impossible mr. rey contends 
 i bought from willing shareholders 
 nevertheless mr. rey has been very careful since then to make sure his moves are welcome 
 and he has worked to shed his raider image 
 in N his career as an <unk> began with the acquisition of the swiss metals works <unk> based in <unk> 
 with the <unk> metals business undermined in switzerland by tough foreign competition and high domestic costs this looked like a <unk> undertaking 
 but mr. rey brought about a merger in the next few years between the country 's major producers the increased efficiency has <unk> up the industry 
 three years later machinery producer <unk> de <unk> <unk> de <unk> s.a. was to become part of the rey empire 
 once again the company 's future looked less than <unk> 
 but after restructuring under new management the profits began rolling in 
 a major boost to mr. rey 's respectability among the swiss came in N when he sold N N of his <unk> bank to the conservative swiss <unk> banks 
 they renamed it swiss <unk> and are using it to expand abroad 
 in N mr. rey <unk> leading publishing houses to take over switzerland 's jean <unk> ag a major producer of magazines and newspapers 
 and with the recent acquisition of N N of <unk> machinery manufacturer <unk> <unk> ag mr. rey has enjoyed the status of white knight 
 <unk> preferred him to financier <unk> <unk> whose <unk> <unk> on the company 's stock had led to a bitter battle 
 meanwhile as such strategic investments have mounted the <unk> arm of mr. rey 's omni holding has been <unk> buying and selling dozens of companies often after a financial or corporate restructuring 
 today this branch of mr. rey 's empire runs under the name <unk> offering services and handles mergers and acquisitions placement of securities and real estate 
 in its portfolio are such diverse companies as united <unk> air europe <unk> inc. a u.s. company that makes supermarket <unk> machines <unk> industries a u.s. manufacturer of securities systems <unk> systems inc. a u.s. regional telephone company and major real-estate projects in the u.s. and europe 
 for financial analysts reading omni 's accounts is a tough challenge 
 companies move in and out says <unk> <unk> of <unk> swiss investment 
 financial analysts note that mr. rey is attracted to companies that are undervalued on the basis of their real-estate interests 
 in august omni unexpectedly bought <unk> 's N N stake in <unk> ag of west germany a <unk> company 
 the internal transaction within the rey empire <unk> <unk> 's small shareholders but analysts say it makes sense for <unk> to focus on its main businesses of product inspection and temporary help 
 mr. rey says the move is yet another example of his <unk> 
 he explains that companies with real estate give security 
 the real estate can be used he points out as guarantees for bank loans for corporate development 
 he says he wants to influence but not manage companies 
 i do n't want to be like financier alan bond and the other <unk> 
 i do n't want companies to be built around me as a person

 in the second step of a reorganization that began earlier this year boeing co. said it will create a defense and space group to consolidate several divisions 
 meanwhile boeing officials and representatives of the machinists union met separately last night with a federal mediator in an attempt to break the <unk> strike that has shut the aerospace giant 's assembly lines at a time when it has an $ N billion backlog of jetliner orders 
 the two sides were scheduled to meet with the mediator this morning 
 machinists already have rejected a package that would provide a N N pay raise plus bonuses over the three-year life of the contract 
 boeing has said repeatedly it wo n't expand its offer and the machinists have responded that the offer is n't good enough 
 however the resolve of some of the striking N machinists might be weakening 
 about N <unk> signed <unk> last week calling for boeing and machinists representatives to schedule new meetings 
 the two sides had n't met since oct. N 
 while boeing 's commercial business is booming its military business is feeling the effects of a declining defense budget after a strong buildup during the reagan presidency

 b. dan <unk> president of boeing aerospace and electronics will become president of the new group which will become operational jan. N 
 in addition boeing said it also will <unk> all its work in wichita into military and commercial divisions 
 all of the changes will reduce its overhead and streamline operations boeing said 
 analysts agreed 
 it 's a further step to better returns in the hemorrhaging defense business said steven <unk> an analyst with bear stearns & co. in new york 
 they had to do it 
 howard <unk> an analyst with <unk> lawrence morgan grenfell inc. in new york said the shift reflects boeing confidence in mr. <unk> described by mr. <unk> as an expert on doing business with the military

 a two-day meeting of representatives of cocom the <unk> group that oversees exports of sensitive goods to communist countries did n't take any <unk> decisions on trimming the list of items under controls 
 nor did it ease restrictions on exports to poland and hungary according to u.s. officials who attended the talks 
 the u.s. had been under pressure from several cocom members especially france west germany and italy to ease restrictions on some types of machine tools which those countries argued were now widely available to east bloc countries from <unk> members 
 for several years some european countries have complained that <unk> cocom lists and restrictions served more to <unk> their trade than to add to western security 
 some countries also have been pressing for special treatment for hungary and poland as they move toward more democratic rule just as special treatment had been agreed on for china 
 but u.s. officials said representatives at the meeting decided that this was a matter for further discussion at future meetings 
 they added that all of us cocom members look at the changes in hungary and poland in a positive way but a question of this scope deserves further discussion and study 
 the officials also said the meeting agreed to continue treating china as a special case despite the recent repression of dissent there but to offer no further concessions 
 the u.s. officials said that despite the rapid changes under way in eastern europe and the soviet union all the cocom members agreed on the continuing need for this organization which was founded N years ago at the start of the cold war 
 the officials said the meeting agreed to continue working toward streamlining cocom 's restricted products list and to improve procedures for <unk> companies that do n't comply with the export restrictions 
 the officials said this meeting put in motion procedural steps that would speed up both of these functions but that no specific decisions were taken on either matter 
 unisys corp. 's announcement friday of a $ N million loss for the third quarter showed that the company is moving even faster than expected to take write-offs on its various problems and prepare for a turnaround next year 
 at the same time the sheer size of the loss coupled with a slowing of orders made some securities analysts wonder just how strong that turnaround will be at the computer maker and <unk> concern 
 unisys is getting clobbered 
 just clobbered said <unk> weil an analyst at weil & associates who had once been high on the company 
 the quarter was terrible and the future looks anything but encouraging 
 unisys whose revenue inched up N N in the quarter to $ N billion from $ N billion in the year-earlier quarter had an operating loss of about $ N million 
 on top of that the blue bell pa. concern took a $ N million charge related to the layoffs of N employees 
 that is at the high end of the range of N to N employees that unisys said a month ago would be laid off 
 unisys said that should help it save $ N million a year in costs again at the high end of the previously reported range of $ N million to $ N million 
 the company also took a write-off of $ N million to cover losses on some fixed-price defense contracts as some new managers took a hard look at the prospects for that <unk> business 
 in addition unisys set up an unspecified reserve apparently $ N million to $ N million to cover the minimum amount it will have to pay the government because of its involvement in the <unk> scandal 
 unisys also noted that it paid $ N million in taxes during the quarter even though tax payments normally would be minimal in a quarter that produced such a big loss 
 the tax payments will leave unisys with $ N million in loss <unk> that will cut tax payments in future quarters 
 in addition unisys said it reduced computer inventories a further $ N million during the quarter leaving it within $ N million of its goal of a reduction of $ N million by the end of the year 
 still unisys said its european business was weak during the quarter a worrisome sign given that the company has relied on solid results overseas to overcome weakness in the u.s. over the past several quarters 
 the company also reported slower growth in another important business systems that use the unix operating system 
 that would be a huge problem if it were to continue because unisys is betting its business on the assumption that customers want to move away from using operating systems that run on only one manufacturer 's equipment and toward systems mainly unix that work on almost anyone 's machines 
 in addition unisys must deal with its increasingly <unk> debt load 
 debt has risen to around $ N billion or about N N of total capitalization 
 that means unisys must pay about $ N million in interest every quarter on top of $ N million in dividends on preferred stock 
 jim <unk> unisys 's president said he is approaching next year with caution 
 he said the strength of the world-wide economy is suspect and does n't see much revenue growth in the cards 
 he also said that the price wars <unk> up in parts of the computer industry will continue through next year 
 he said the move toward standard operating systems means customers are n't locked into buying from their traditional computer supplier and can force prices down 
 that he said is why unisys is <unk> its whole business it needs to prepare for a world in which profit margins will be lower than computer companies have been used to 
 we 've approached this not as a response to a temporary condition in the industry but as a fundamental change the industry is going through mr. <unk> said 
 the <unk> industry is still going to be a <unk> business and we 're confident that we have tremendous assets as a company 
 but we do n't minimize the challenges of the near term 
 securities analysts were even more cautious having been burned repeatedly on unisys this year 
 some had predicted earnings of more than $ N a share for this year up from last year 's fully diluted $ N a share on earnings of $ N million 
 but the company said friday that it had losses of $ N million through the first nine months compared with earnings a year earlier of $ N million or $ N a share fully diluted as revenue inched up N N to $ N billion from $ N billion 
 and unisys is expected to do little better than break even in the fourth quarter 
 so steve <unk> at first boston said he is cutting his earnings estimate for next year to $ N a share from $ N 
 i was feeling like i was too high to begin with he said 
 mr. weil of weil & associates said he will remain at $ N a share for next year but said he <unk> whether even that low target is at risk 
 the break-even point for next year is much lower but is it low enough he asked 
 reflecting the concern unisys stock fell a further N cents to $ N in composite trading friday on the new york stock exchange 
 if a tv <unk> gets <unk> facing the camera again after a questionable forecast donald h. straszheim surely understands 
 the chief economist of merrill lynch & co. finds himself in such a position as he <unk> the midwest on his first road trip since <unk> on a major prediction 
 mr. straszheim expects he will take some heat and he 's right 
 since the last time he traveled this way several months ago he has <unk> a series of bold forecasts of a recession 
 in february N for example merrill lynch 's weekly commentary announced that the economy is likely to fall into recession in early N 
 the forecasts were widely <unk> and in a <unk> ad campaign launched in the summer of N merrill lynch urged investors to buy bonds 
 it said long-term interest rates then above N N could drop to N N by the end of N so bonds which benefit from falling rates would be a good buy 
 the firm also raised the percentage of bonds in its model portfolio from N N to N N and later to N N 
 but this september just when many market economists including some at merrill lynch believed that mr. straszheim was about to be proved right he took a <unk> if not a <unk> 
 he <unk> the talk about a recession 
 now in fact he is predicting economic growth of N N this year and N N next year a more optimistic outlook than the consensus of some four dozen top <unk> surveyed by blue chip economic indicators newsletter 
 and just recently merrill lynch cut the recommended <unk> back to N N 
 while such changes might sound minor they are n't merrill lynch manages or oversees some $ N billion in retail accounts that include everything from mutual funds to individual annuities 
 two well-known colleagues who believe mr. straszheim was right the first time are david <unk> jr. and a. gary <unk> both of whom run their own new york research firms 
 mr. <unk> said in august that his <unk> index signaled recession 
 mr. <unk> who was merrill lynch 's chief economist from N to N has <unk> a recession for months 
 my own personal opinion is that don threw in the towel just about the time he should have doubled his bet he says 
 now a rocky stock market and weak corporate profits may further threaten the economy 
 and mr. straszheim conceded after a recent drop in manufacturing jobs that it may prove to be the case that we got <unk> that we pulled the recession forecast at just the wrong time 
 he adds that 's the forecasting business 
 however risky the business it 's brisk these days 
 <unk> by bosses brokers clients and media people and pushed by their own <unk> wall street economists are forecasting about everything from broad economic trends to the <unk> monthly indicator 
 but the surprisingly durable seven-year economic expansion has made <unk> of more than one forecast 
 this is n't the quiet economic science practiced in the universities 
 this is the commercial version 
 carrying the new message on the road mr. straszheim meets confrontation that often occurs in <unk> proportion to the size of the client 
 no sophisticated professional expects economists to be right all the time 
 some smaller clients do n't seem to notice his switch 
 but with some clients the talk can heat up a bit 
 dennis o'brien the treasurer of commonwealth edison co. in chicago <unk> a <unk> approach waiting for an opportunity to ask about the forecast 
 a good half-hour into breakfast at the palmer house mr. o'brien looks up from his plate after mr. straszheim says something about people who believe interest rates are about to <unk> 
 i 'm one of them who hope they will with $ N billion in debt on the books 
 is that the forecast mr. o'brien asks trying to <unk> down the economist 
 he does n't fully succeed although mr. straszheim lists an array of interest-rate scenarios 
 in a <unk> conference room at alliance capital management in minneapolis in contrast the firm 's money managers seem ready to <unk> mr. straszheim to the wall 
 alfred harrison the manager <unk> mr. straszheim 's <unk> back at him do we want to go through this 
 or can we ask you why you changed your forecast just when it 's about to be right 
 <unk> in his chair mr. straszheim replies that the new outlook though still weak does n't justify calling a recession right now 
 it 's all in this <unk> you do n't want to look at 
 we could still have a recession at some point 
 one of mr. straszheim 's <unk> themes is that the state of the economy is n't a simple black or white 
 sometimes like now it 's gray 
 this <unk> assessment moves one alliance portfolio manager to ask so what is this a <unk> recession 
 another challenges merrill lynch 's bond recommendation last year 
 we 're not running that ad campaign any more mr. straszheim <unk> in a rare show of <unk> 
 he adds i think it was a fairly decent call 
 explaining his change of mind mr. straszheim says later it 's hard to <unk> this on one factor 
 he says the economy and especially the employment numbers look much better than he expected interest rates have generally declined inflation has n't run <unk> 
 our business is constantly looking at all these things he says 
 his new forecast calls for a soft landing 
 and it may be right judging from last week 's report that inflation-adjusted gross national product rose at a N N annual rate in the third quarter 
 mr. <unk> understands mr. straszheim 's problems 
 there 's <unk> pressure on economists to forecast these numbers he says 
 you make a forecast and then you become its prisoner 
 it is indeed hard to back away from a widely publicized forecast and mr. straszheim is <unk> with the <unk> on this trip 
 his approach to the <unk> is direct but <unk> 
 for some time we had forecast negative third and fourth-quarter growth 
 we pulled that forecast he begins <unk> in a meeting with <unk> <unk> & <unk> inc. officials in minneapolis the first stop 
 crane co. said it holds an N N stake in milton roy corp. an <unk> maker and may seek control of the company 
 crane a maker of engineered products for aerospace construction defense and other uses made the disclosure in a securities and exchange commission filing

 milton roy disclosed in may that it was approached for a possible acquisition by <unk> <unk> which agreed to purchase milton roy 's <unk> line for $ N million in february

 it has n't made merger <unk> to the board 
 earlier this month milton roy signed a letter of intent to acquire automated custom systems inc. orange calif. and its sister operation environmental testing co. in <unk> <unk> 
 the companies are <unk> concerns 
 under the terms milton roy will pay an initial $ N million for the operations and additional payments during the next four years based on the earnings performance of the businesses 
 in the nine months milton roy earned $ N million or $ N a share on sales of $ N million 
 last week the british displayed unusual political <unk> 
 the chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson resigned because prime minister thatcher would not fire her trusted adviser sir alan walters 
 the opposition labor party leader neil <unk> in a display of the male <unk> typical of the british lower class denounced mrs. thatcher for having an independent mind and refusing to <unk> the men in her cabinet 
 the british press making a mountain out of a <unk> <unk> an unnecessary economic crisis by portraying mrs. thatcher as an <unk> who had thrown economic policy into confusion by driving a respected figure from her government 
 behind the silly <unk> lies a real dispute 
 mr. lawson and his <unk> colleagues want the british pound formally tied to the west german mark 
 sir alan considers this an <unk> and costly policy 
 as there is an effort to <unk> the dollar either to gold or other currencies the dispute is worth <unk> 
 until his resignation mr. lawson had been conducting british monetary policy as if the pound were tied to the mark 
 when mrs. thatcher cut the top tax rate to N N mr. lawson flooded the country with money to prevent the pound from rising against the mark 
 as a result he <unk> the inflation that mrs. thatcher through a long and costly effort had subdued 
 with inflation surging the pound began falling against the mark 
 to keep the exchange rate pegged mr. lawson tightened monetary policy and pushed interest rates up to N N 
 this doubled the mortgage interest rates of the many new homeowners that mrs. thatcher 's policies had created producing widespread <unk> and pushing labor ahead in the polls 
 instead of <unk> his mistake in letting the exchange rate dominate both british economic policy and mrs. thatcher 's political fortune mr. lawson pushed for <unk> the pound formally to the mark by entering the european monetary system which subordinates all member currencies to german monetary policy 
 this put mrs. thatcher in a <unk> 
 the concept of european integration is one of those grand schemes that appeal to intellectuals the media and the <unk> but are full of practical <unk> 
 if the pound had been tied to the mark the british would have been unable to cut their <unk> tax rates 
 the reason is simple 
 when a country cuts tax rates it makes itself more attractive to investors and drives up the value of its currency 
 it was fear of disturbing ems exchange-rate relationships that caused the <unk> government in france to be <unk> about cutting tax rates 
 <unk> <unk> the finance minister at the time was sold on the <unk> policy but was concerned that his government would be criticized as <unk> for disturbing the linked european currency relationship 
 the price of attracting capital whether one 's own or that of foreigners is a trade deficit 
 to avoid this deficit mr. lawson inflated the pound in order to prevent its rise 
 this <unk> policy could not prevent a british trade deficit 
 consequently mr. lawson <unk> mrs. thatcher with a record trade deficit renewed inflation and high interest rates three political failures in a row 
 little wonder that mrs. thatcher 's opponents were so anxious to keep mr. lawson in office 
 it is extraordinary that the british treasury thought it could prevent a trade deficit by <unk> the pound 
 the british <unk> statistics show that after the top tax rate was cut to N N the flow abroad of british capital slowed to N billion pounds $ N billion at the current rate in N from N billion pounds in N 
 this change in the british capital account required an offsetting change in the trade account a change that could not be prevented by <unk> the currency 
 nigel lawson was a victim of the <unk> confusion in thought that has been characteristic of western financial circles during the 1980s 
 the most important governments have ignored the role of low tax rates in attracting real capital investment instead <unk> financial flows in response to high interest rates 
 this has led them in a <unk> and <unk> policy circle 
 first comes monetary expansion to drive down the currency 's value that was pushed up by <unk> reduction 
 then when the currency falls interest rates are raised to attract financial flows in order to stabilize the exchange rate 
 this policy is totally <unk> and sir alan is correct to point out its deficiencies 
 britain and all of europe need to reconsider the prospects for european integration in light of the possible reunification and <unk> of germany 
 a unified germany that remained within the western alliance would give germany such an <unk> position that all other members of a unified europe would become <unk> of the german state 
 unless the soviet union <unk> german reunification is likely to require germany 's <unk> 
 the implications for britain france and the rest of europe of having their currencies tied to the economic policy of a neutral country need considering before we judge mr. lawson 's resignation to be unfortunate 
 in the least we must recognize the <unk> of trying to use exchange-rate intervention to offset the effects of <unk> reduction on capital flows 
 mr. roberts was assistant treasury secretary under president reagan

 personal spending which fueled the economy 's growth in the third quarter was clearly slowing by the end of the period raising questions about the economy 's strength as the year ends 
 personal spending grew N N in september to a $ N trillion annual rate the commerce department said 
 it was the smallest monthly increase in a year 
 at the same time personal income was held down by the effects of hurricane hugo which <unk> through parts of north and south carolina in late september 
 the department said personal income rose N N in september to a $ N trillion rate but would have climbed N N had it not been for the storm 
 among the economic effects of the hurricane was a sharp drop in rental income 
 the figures came a day after the government released a report showing that consumer spending propelled u.s. economic expansion in the third quarter while on an inflation-adjusted basis business investment slowed government spending declined and exports were flat 
 but the new statistics show that by september the burst in spending seemed to be <unk> off 
 many economists expect the weakness to continue 
 i think the consumer has pretty well played himself out said david <unk> senior economist at manufacturers national bank of detroit 
 i do n't think there 's a lot in the wings in other sectors of the economy to keep growth above N N he said 
 in the third quarter the economy grew at a moderate N N annual rate 
 in august personal income rose N N and spending grew N N 
 analysts have attributed much of the summer 's <unk> in spending to bargain car prices at the end of the model year 
 car sales <unk> in september after the N models were introduced 
 according to the commerce department report spending on durable goods items expected to last at least three years including cars declined by $ N billion 
 the nation 's savings rate was unchanged in september at N N of after-tax income far below the N N it reached in july 
 all the figures are adjusted for seasonal variations 
 here is the commerce department 's latest report on personal income 
 the figures are at seasonally adjusted annual rates in <unk> of dollars 
 <unk> ltd. said it agreed to sell a N N stake in its <unk> coal mine in the state of new south <unk> to mitsubishi development <unk> of japan

 <unk> is <unk> by <unk> corp. of britain 
 control data corp. which just months ago was hemorrhaging financially thinks it will be healthy enough soon to consider <unk> public debt 
 moreover the company whose <unk> approach nearly proved fatal now sees alliances with others as the way back to prosperity in what it calls the data solutions business 
 i 'm not saying everything is <unk> but we have completed the transition robert m. price chairman and chief executive said in an interview 
 transition is a reference to the company 's five-year restructuring effort 
 during that time control data had losses of more than $ N billion 
 now following asset sales that shrank revenue by more than one-third this year alone control data is flush with cash 
 so its senior executives are talking openly about possibly buying back some of the company 's $ N million in subordinated convertible debentures next year 
 we 'd like to continue to reduce debt president lawrence perlman said 
 noting that the company is offering to buy back $ N million in senior notes paying N N N he said the response will help determine future <unk> efforts 
 the offer was automatically triggered by the recent sale of control data 's <unk> disk-drive business to seagate technology inc 
 mr. perlman who is also acting chief financial officer and the <unk> favorite to become the next chief executive said the company is <unk> modest positive cash flow from operations and we expect that to continue into N 
 he said the company has no intention of <unk> its short-term bank lines for a good part of N 
 sometime next year control data will develop a new bank relationship mr. perlman said 
 in recent months a group of lenders led by bank of america has extended control data up to $ N million in revolving loans through january as well as $ N million in <unk> letters of credit 
 loan <unk> require that the company achieve specified levels of operating earnings and meet a rolling <unk> profitability test 
 last week control data reported third-quarter earnings of $ N million or N cents a share on revenue of $ N million 
 through the first nine months the company had a loss of $ N million largely reflecting the closing of its supercomputer unit 
 while a few assets are still being <unk> including the sports and entertainment <unk> portion of the company 's <unk> unit mr. price said future restructuring would be a question of strategy 
 we do n't need the cash 
 <unk> 's automated <unk> business which operates <unk> in a half dozen states is not for sale the company said 
 rather mr. perlman said control data intends to bid for the coming minnesota <unk> contract and is seeking new applications for the technology overseas where there is great interest in games of <unk> 
 he would n't elaborate 
 control data 's semiconductor business <unk> inc. continues to lose money the executives acknowledged but they said they consider some of the technology vital to national defense and so are reluctant to <unk> of it 
 the company 's strategy for keeping its computer products business profitable it recently achieved profitability after several quarters of losses calls for a narrow focus and a lid on expenses 
 partly costs will be held down through strategic technology alliances management said 
 control data recently announced an agreement with mips computer systems inc. to jointly develop machines with <unk> operating software 
 james e. <unk> computer products group president said such arrangements could help slash control data 's computer research and development costs in half by the end of N 
 he disclosed that before control data scrapped its <unk> systems inc. supercomputer business this past spring those costs were running at nearly N N of group revenue 
 at the same time four of six design projects were <unk> he said 
 asked how the company hopes to expand its computer hardware business mr. <unk> said it sees good opportunities in systems integration 
 we think we 're getting only N N of the integration dollars our customers are spending he said 
 we 're in environments that are going to spend a lot of money on that 
 control data mainframes are designed for <unk> intensive computing users such as the scientific engineering and academic communities 
 utilities management is a major commercial niche 
 reviewing the company 's <unk> with disaster mr. price conceded it had tried to do too much on its own 
 absolutely he said 
 but while its stock is selling at about half control data 's estimated breakup value neither messrs. perlman nor price said he spends much time considering the possibility of a hostile takeover 
 we 've been listed as a candidate for so long it 's not worth worrying about said mr. price 
 well the arrogant east coast media have spoken again going for the green editorial oct. N 
 having <unk> in the great state of california for the past seven years i find it hard to ignore our environmental problems when i start my commute to work with eyes <unk> and head <unk> from the <unk> air when i try to enjoy the <unk> and come home covered with <unk> and oil when i hear of numerous deaths related to irresponsible processing of <unk> and use of chemicals in fruit growing 
 perhaps it 's entertaining for those like you to discount the concerns of environmentalists suggesting that their <unk> initiatives are <unk> and referring to so many citizens as <unk> activists 
 strange that we do n't hear similar criticisms of the east coast activists who seek to clean up boston harbor or rid their <unk> of medical waste 
 while there are no easy low-cost solutions simply ignoring our problems will result in their <unk> increasing and spreading throughout the state the nation and the world 
 if nothing else such initiatives as these will provide an awareness to citizens and lawmakers and encourage appropriate <unk> action 
 before your next <unk> editorial please spend more time out here <unk> the situation it just may change your view 
 john barry <unk> calif 
 i realize you were just looking for something <unk> to say about california and its environmental movement but picking frank lloyd wright to say it for you was a bad call 
 wright 's organic architecture demonstrated a keen <unk> to the environment decades before it became fashionable among <unk> activists 
 indeed wright said all his life that the greatest <unk> he learned were derived from the study of nature 
 obviously it 's lost on you that about N N of the american people these days and in fact the president of the united states consider themselves environmentalists 
 as for california being a state run by liberal environmental <unk> let 's not forget where ronald reagan came from 
 perhaps mr. reagan who claimed that air pollution is caused by trees is the man you should be <unk> to back up your position that economics is more important than the earth 
 but it was frank lloyd wright who said is this not <unk> 
 the <unk> that knows no god but more 
 robert <unk> santa <unk> calif 
 your editorial was <unk> and neatly matched by the readers ' comments in letters to the editor <unk> scaring on the side of caution 
 the <unk> and <unk> of john h. adams 's comments for the national resources defense council fully justifies your <unk> of california 's greens in particular as <unk> activists 
 we may all hope that california 's voters will <unk> the scientific realities that their own university 's <unk> prof. tom <unk> provides them and ignore the <unk> <unk> by their wealthy hollywood <unk> 
 i have a different approach to offer not only to californians but to all americans 
 in a free country the law should restrict citizens as little as is consistent with good <unk> and public safety 
 would-be <unk> should have the burden of proving reasonable necessity when they urge a prohibition for enactment into law

 if this battle were a movie the producers would be fighting over two scripts with nothing but an opening scene in common

 shortly after that sony would offer to buy guber-peters entertainment co. for $ N million and offer its <unk> peter guber and jon peters the chance to run columbia

 in affidavits filed in los angeles superior court in connection with the $ N billion <unk> suit warner brought against sony for hiring the two producers mr. guber and mr. peters tell one story 
 warner tells another 
 in the affidavits mr. peters says he was shocked when mr. ross refused a meeting and made it clear he would stop them 
 mr. peters claims he reminded mr. ross that robert daly and terry semel the top executives of the warner brothers studio had repeatedly agreed that we had every right to accept an offer such as sony 's 
 in response mr. peters says mr. ross referred to his colleagues at warner with an <unk> and said tell them that they do n't have a job 
 you can take them with you

 the matter may never even be tried in court 
 warner says that what it really wants is for the producers to fulfill their <unk> obligations but the <unk> of this battle and the accusations flying on both sides make it unlikely that the <unk> relationship between warner and its two most <unk> producers can ever be repaired 
 warner which is in the process of <unk> with time warner inc. says it is willing to settle the matter out of court 
 so far however sony has n't been willing to meet its considerable financial demands 
 mr. guber and mr. peters do n't have much to gain from a <unk> battle 
 sony for its part could decide that the cost of a warner settlement or court fight is too high choosing instead to find someone else to run columbia although that too would be costly given the financial arrangement already guaranteed to mr. guber and mr. peters 
 in that case mr. guber and mr. peters might not suffer financially but they would be left without their dream job of running a studio and with a considerably <unk> relationship with warner 
 at the center of any court fight will be the <unk> <unk> of the written contract between warner and the two producers but other <unk> issues will play a big role 
 sony and the guber-peters team are hanging much of their case on warner 's willingness last year to release the producers from another contract and on an oral agreement they say allowed them to terminate the current written contract if the opportunity to run a major studio came up 
 warner denies such an agreement was made and disputes the guber-peters version of virtually every telephone call and meeting the two sides had on the matter 
 just how <unk> the relationship has become is clear from the <unk> versions of the two sides ' current business dealings 
 mr. guber and mr. peters say in their affidavits that warner already is taking steps to freeze them out of their projects at warner notably the <unk> <unk> film <unk> and cash 
 mr. peters says in his affidavit that the movie 's staff was told last week that warner was taking over the picture and another producer would be giving all of the orders 
 over his objections mr. peters says the film 's release date was moved up by many months to december and plans for a <unk> worth millions of dollars were dropped 
 <unk> de la <unk> an editor on the film backs mr. peters in a separate sworn declaration 
 mr. de la <unk> says warner brothers production president mark canton called him oct. N and said mr. peters is off the picture 
 if he calls you up just tell him everything is fine 
 the editor also says the new producer on the film bruce <unk> told editors to screen the picture without telling stars <unk> <unk> and kurt russell or mr. peters 
 the less they know the easier it is for us 
 if someone asks just lie and tell them it will be done mr. de la <unk> says mr. <unk> told them 
 that says warner 's mr. <unk> is a total N N lie 
 the movie he says is in its <unk> stages of cleaning up the film 
 he says mr. peters and mr. guber as the <unk> producers with <unk> rights have been invited to <unk> and to give their input on the film 
 dozens of guber-peters staffers are still working on the warner lot and consulting on various projects on a daily basis the attorney says 
 mr. guber in his affidavit says that when he advised warner president terry semel of the sony offer at lunch on sept. N mr. semel <unk> and <unk> me and expressed <unk> that we had finally realized our long-term <unk> of running and having an equity position in a major entertainment company 
 mr. guber says he brought to lunch a release document warner had agreed to in N when he and mr. peters made an aborted bid to buy part of mgm\/ua entertainment co. to run the mgm studio 
 mr. guber says he had crossed out mgm with a red <unk> and written in columbia giving the document to mr. semel 
 mr. semel said absolutely nothing to indicate warner would have any <unk> to our assuming management positions at columbia mr. guber says 
 mr. semel in his affidavit does n't mention any <unk> or <unk> 
 he says he told mr. guber he could n't sign any documents and that the deal although apparently a good one for him and mr. peters would have a very negative impact on warner 
 he said he would contact mr. ross and warner brothers chairman robert daly and that in a conference call the three agreed they could n't let the producers out of their contract 
 mr. ross in his own affidavit says he and mr. daly instructed mr. semel to tell the producers warner would n't terminate their agreement 
 mr. guber says that mr. semel did convey that information and that mr. semel said mr. ross was crazy because of the time deal meaning mr. guber says that mr. ross did not want to <unk> to his new merger partner time inc. that warner 's agreements provided for our departure under these circumstances 
 mr. guber also says in his affidavit that mr. daly told us that even if sony did not want us warner 's relationship with us already was <unk> damaged that there was no way to put the egg together and that it would sue sony for tons of money 
 moreover mr. guber claims mr. semel told him that mr. ross probably would n't object if it were anybody other than sony 
 but sony is a problem 
 the guber-peters side has said warner is particularly concerned about the prospect of a huge japanese company controlling important segments of the u.s. entertainment business 
 some in hollywood suggest mr. guber and mr. peters took encouragement from warner studio executives such as mr. semel and mr. canton too literally 
 according to this theory warner executives hoping to strengthen their relationships with the producers encouraged mr. guber and mr. peters in their ambitions to build a major entertainment company 
 but the warner executives in their affidavits deny ever telling the producers they could get out of their written contract 
 mr. <unk> the warner attorney says the studio still wants the producers to come back and fulfill their contract 
 they are like a <unk> they have N projects in development for warner he says 
 but mr. guber indicates in his affidavit that not all of the projects will be used 
 for example he says that since N he and mr. peters have developed over N movie projects and warner has passed or chosen not to produce at least N 
 as for the projects remaining at warner mr. guber says mr. semel informed me that warner 's producers have already started a feeding frenzy for our projects

 despite politicians ' <unk> about the federal budget the government ended fiscal N with a $ N billion deficit about the same as the two previous years 
 even white house budget director richard darman had trouble finding a silver <unk> in the report 
 i <unk> you could say the good news is that the deficits are not heading up he said but you ca n't be satisfied with deficits at this level and we 're not 
 the federal deficit was $ N billion in N and $ N billion in N 
 the N deficit would have been nearly $ N billion larger had the government been able to spend as much as congress intended on cleaning up the thrift industry before the year ended on sept. N 
 because the resolution trust corp could n't spend the money fast enough the savings-and-loan outlays were pushed into fiscal N 
 nevertheless the N deficit still exceeded the $ N billion target set by the gramm-rudman deficit-reduction law by $ N billion a reminder of that law 's <unk> 
 the law sets a deficit target of $ N billion for fiscal N 
 a <unk> fight over cutting capital-gains taxes has slowed the progress of N deficit-reduction legislation almost to a halt triggering across-the-board spending cuts under the gramm-rudman law 
 the white house and the democratic leadership in congress blame each other for turning capital-gains taxes into such a divisive issue this year 
 neither side showed any sign of retreating 
 meeting with reporters friday mr. darman again said he would rather live with across-the-board spending cuts than accept a deficit-reduction bill like the one passed by the house which would increase spending in future years 
 <unk> the size of the deficits of the past few years the treasury report showed that for the first time interest paid on the public debt $ N billion exceeded spending on social security the single largest government program 
 in all federal outlays amounted to $ N trillion in N up N N from the previous year the treasury said 
 federal revenues rose N N to $ N billion 
 the treasury said a surge in tax receipts noted earlier in the year did n't turn out to be quite as strong as it first appeared 
 the treasury marked up its forecast by $ N million in july but that proved to be about $ N billion too optimistic 
 the government ran a deficit of $ N billion in september compared with a surplus of $ N billion in september N 
 outlays for the month totaled $ N billion up from $ N billion a year earlier 
 the increase reflects spending on the s&l rescue as well as payroll and social security checks normally issued in october that were issued in september this year because oct. N fell on a sunday 
 revenues were $ N billion up from $ N billion a year earlier 
 cms energy corp. said it would begin paying a <unk> quarterly dividend the company 's first since N 
 consumers power co. now the main unit of cms energy ran into financial problems over its $ N billion midland nuclear plant which was abandoned as a nuclear facility in N because of construction delays and high costs 
 cms is nearly done converting the midland plant to a <unk> <unk> facility at a cost of $ N million 
 cms management said thursday that they planned to recommend paying a modest dividend when the board of directors met friday 
 the dividend will be paid nov. N to shares of record nov. N 
 the company suffered a loss of $ N million in N but its financial situation has been improving since then 
 humana inc. said it expects to receive about $ N million in federal income-tax refunds and interest from a court ruling on a tax dispute 
 the health-care company said it expects the refund to be included in the first quarter ending nov. N 
 the refund is about $ N million 
 accrued interest on the refund was about $ N million as of oct. N 
 the refund stems from a court ruling that found certain payments by humana subsidiaries to its insurance subsidiary during fiscal N through N were deductible as premiums for liability insurance 
 polly peck international inc. 's agreement to acquire N N of sansui electric co. proves that foreign companies can acquire japanese companies if the alternative for the japanese company is <unk> 
 polly peck a fast-growing british conglomerate will pay N billion yen $ N million for N million new shares of sansui a well-known maker of <unk> audio equipment that failed to adjust to changing market conditions 
 japanese government officials eager to <unk> foreign criticism of japanese investments overseas hailed the transaction as proof foreigners can make similar investments in japan 
 polly peck 's chairman <unk> <unk> <unk> the official japanese view of the accord which was announced friday 
 the <unk> that japan is not open to concerns from outside has i think been <unk> at a <unk> mr. <unk> said 
 but analysts say sansui is a special case 
 it expects to post a loss of N billion yen for the year ending tomorrow and its liabilities currently exceed its assets by about N billion yen 
 if you find sound healthy companies in japan they are not for sale said george <unk> a <unk> at tokyo-based asia advisory services inc 
 statistics on acquisitions by foreigners vary in detail because unlike sansui which is listed on the tokyo and osaka stock exchanges most of the japanese companies acquired by foreigners are privately held 
 but by all accounts foreign companies have bought only a relative handful of japanese companies this year while japanese companies have acquired hundreds of foreign companies 
 nor do analysts expect the sansui deal to touch off a fresh wave of foreign purchases 
 if the strong yen and the high stock prices of japanese companies were n't <unk> enough <unk> of <unk> between friendly japanese companies and fiercely independent japanese corporate attitudes <unk> most would-be <unk> 
 usually when a japanese company is ready to sell it has few alternatives remaining and the grim <unk> of sansui 's directors at a joint news conference here left little doubt that this was not the company 's <unk> hour 
 sansui was once one of japan 's premier makers of expensive high-quality stereo gear for <unk> 
 but in recent years the market has moved toward less expensive <unk> sets <unk> <unk> and <unk> and software players that could be <unk> on top of each other 
 some of sansui 's fellow <unk> companies such as <unk> co. and pioneer electric corp. responded to the challenge by quickly bringing out <unk> products of their own by moving heavily into the booming compact disk businesses or by diversifying into other <unk> fields including laser disks or portable <unk> players 
 sansui was late into the <unk> business and failed to branch into other new businesses 
 as the yen soared in recent years sansui 's <unk> financial problems became a vicious circle 
 while competitors moved production offshore in response to the sagging competitiveness of japanese factories sansui lacked the money to build new plants in southeast asia 
 our company has not been able to cope very effectively with changes in the marketplace said <unk> <unk> sansui 's president 
 but even a japanese company that looks like a dog may turn out to be a good investment for a foreign concern some management consultants maintain 
 <unk> <unk> a management consultant for <unk> & hamilton japan inc. said his firm will likely be recommending acquisitions of japanese companies more often to foreign clients in the future 
 attitudes toward being acquired are still negative but they 're becoming more positive mr. <unk> said 
 in some industries like pharmaceuticals acquisitions make sense 
 whether polly peck 's acquisition makes sense remains to be seen but at the news conference mr. <unk> <unk> with <unk> that he can turn sansui around 
 sansui he said is a perfect fit for polly peck 's electronics operations which make <unk> videocassette recorders <unk> and other products on an original equipment maker basis for sale under other companies ' brand names 
 he said polly peck will greatly expand sansui 's product line using sansui 's engineers to design the new products and will move sansui 's production of most products other than sophisticated audio gear offshore into polly peck 's own factories 
 whatever capital it sansui needs so it can compete and become a totally global entity capable of competing with the best in the world that capital will be <unk> mr. <unk> said 
 and while polly peck is n't <unk> the <unk> <unk> structure of sansui it is bringing in a former toshiba corp. executive as executive vice president and chief operating officer 
 such risk taking is an everyday matter for the <unk> mr. <unk> who is N N owner of polly peck as well as its chairman 
 he took polly peck once a small fabric <unk> and used it at as a base to build a conglomerate that has been doubling its profits annually since N 
 in september it announced plans to acquire the <unk> business of rjr nabisco inc. 's del monte foods unit for # N million $ N million

 the bolstered cellular agreement between bellsouth corp. and lin broadcasting corp. carries heightened risks and could fail to fend off mccaw cellular communications inc. the rival suitor for lin 
 moreover the amended pact shows how mccaw 's <unk> has pushed lin and bellsouth into a corner forcing huge debt on the proposed new company 
 the debt estimated at $ N billion could mortgage the cellular company 's future earning power in order to <unk> some lin holders in the short term 
 the plan still calls for lin to combine its cellular telephone properties with bellsouth 's and to spin off its broadcasting operations 
 but under new terms of the agreement announced friday lin holders would receive a special cash dividend of $ N a share representing a payout of about $ N billion shortly before the proposed merger 
 lin said it expects to borrow the money to pay the dividend but commitments from banks still have n't been obtained 
 under previous terms holders would have received a dividend of only $ N a share 
 in addition new york-based lin would exercise its right to buy out for $ N billion the N N equity interest of its partner metromedia co. in a new york cellular franchise 
 that money also would have to be borrowed 
 in effect mccaw has forced lin 's hand by bidding $ N billion for the stake earlier this month 
 we 're taking on more debt than we would have liked to acknowledged michael <unk> lin 's vice president and treasurer 
 although he expressed confidence that the proposed new company 's cash flow would be sufficient to cover interest payments on the debt he estimated that the company would n't be profitable until N or later 
 analyst estimate the value of the bellsouth proposal at about $ N to $ N a share 
 they value mccaw 's bid at $ N to $ N a share 
 the previous bellsouth pact was valued at about $ N to $ N a share 
 mccaw the largest provider of cellular telephone service in the u.s. already owns about N N of lin 's stock 
 in response to bellsouth 's amended pact the <unk> wash. company extended its own offer to buy N million lin shares for $ N apiece which would give mccaw a N N controlling interest 
 over the weekend mccaw continued to call for an auction of lin 
 analysts said they expect mccaw to <unk> the bidding again 
 this game is n't over yet said joel d. gross a vice president at donaldson lufkin & jenrette securities corp 
 at some point it will become <unk> for one company 
 but i do n't think we 're at that point yet 
 under its revised proposal atlanta-based bellsouth would have a N N interest in the new cellular company and would be responsible for half of its debt 
 to <unk> the pact further and to ease concerns of institutional investors bellsouth added a provision designed to give extra protection to holders if the regional bell company ever decides to buy the rest of the new cellular company 
 the provision described as <unk> protection would require bellsouth to pay a price equivalent to what an outside party might have to pay 
 mccaw 's bid also has a similar clause 
 only mccaw 's proposal requires the company to begin an auction process in june N for remaining shares at <unk> prices 
 to <unk> shareholders concerned about the long-term value of the company under the <unk> agreement bellsouth also agreed to pay as much as $ N a share or $ N million if after five years the trading value of the new cellular company is n't as high as the value that shareholders would have realized from the mccaw offer 
 we 're very pleased with the new deal 
 we did n't expect bellsouth to be so responsive said frederick a. <unk> president of <unk> asset management inc. which holds N lin shares 
 bellsouth 's <unk> protection was flawed previously 
 we think this is a superior deal to mccaw 's 
 we 're surprised 
 we did n't think a sleeping bell mentality would be willing to take on <unk> 
 but kenneth leon a telecommunications analyst with bear stearns & co. finds the bellsouth proposal still flawed because the company does n't have to wait five years to begin buying more lin shares 
 how many shares will be around in N he asked 
 there 's nothing preventing bellsouth from buying up shares in the meanwhile 
 bellsouth 's revised proposal surprised many industry analysts especially because of the company 's willingness to accept some <unk> of future earnings 
 william o. <unk> president of the company 's bellsouth enterprises inc. unit said the revised agreement with lin would <unk> bellsouth earnings by about N N in both N and N and by significantly less thereafter 
 indeed bellsouth 's cellular operations were among the first in the country to become profitable 
 for N bellsouth earned $ N billion or $ N a share on revenue of $ N billion 
 analysts were predicting N bellsouth earnings in the range of $ N a share or $ N billion but now those estimates are being scaled back 
 in composite trading friday on the new york stock exchange bellsouth shares fell N cents to $ N 
 in national over-the-counter trading lin shares soared $ N to closed at $ N while mccaw fell $ N a share to $ N 
 the proposed <unk> cellular company including the newly acquired metromedia stake would give the new entity N million potential customers including about N million in the nation 's top N markets 
 mr. leon of bear stearns speculated that mccaw in an attempt to buy time might consider filing an antitrust suit against bellsouth with the justice department and u.s. district judge harold greene who oversees enforcement of the consent <unk> that broke up the bell system in N 
 indeed mccaw seemed to hint at that option in a brief statement 
 urging lin directors to conduct a fair auction on a level playing field mccaw asked how well the public interest would be served with the bell operating companies controlling over N N of all cellular potential customers in the nation 's top N markets 
 market makers in nasdaq over-the-counter stocks are adding their voices to the swelling chorus of complaints about program trading 
 their <unk> however has a strong practical aspect program trading is hazardous to their <unk> 
 the most controversial form of program trading stock-index arbitrage is making it tough for traders to make money declares robert <unk> head of otc trading at donaldson lufkin & jenrette 
 stock-index arbitrage the computer-guided buying and selling of stocks with offsetting trades in stock-index futures to profit from fleeting price discrepancies affects the otc market directly through the N stocks included in standard & poor 's 500-stock index 
 the s&p N is often used in arbitrage strategies 
 the portion of otc volume attributable to program trading is n't known as it is on the new york stock exchange where it amounted to more than N N in september 
 estimates from traders put it at less than N N of nasdaq 's average daily volume of roughly N million shares 
 other <unk> <unk> program trading also causes the nasdaq composite index to lose ground against other segments of the stock market 
 because of program trading it is more difficult to trade many otc stocks without sharp price moves a condition known as <unk> 
 moreover the price volatility that is <unk> by program trading is <unk> efforts to woo individual investors back to an otc market that <unk> misses them 
 some of these problems are neither new nor unique to the otc market 
 but the big often tumultuous slide in stock prices this month has turned some of those who have been <unk> from the practice against it 
 peter dapuzzo head of retail equity trading at shearson lehman hutton acknowledges that he was n't troubled by program trading when it began in the <unk> bull market because it added liquidity and people were pleased to see stock prices rising 
 we were n't as concerned until they became sell programs says mr. dapuzzo who now thinks it adds unnecessary volatility 
 shearson lehman however <unk> program trades for clients 
 merrill lynch goldman sachs and kidder peabody in addition to shearson do <unk> otc stocks 
 shearson merrill lynch and goldman sachs say they do so only for customers however 
 kidder peabody does program trading for its own as well as clients ' accounts 
 of course there were sell programs in past years too but they seem to hurt market makers more painfully these days 
 that 's largely because of defensive measures they adopted after the N crash when individual investors fled the market and trading activity <unk> 
 market makers to cut costs slashed inventories of stocks they keep on hand to sell investors when other holders are n't selling 
 and to protect their reduced capital investment from eroding further market makers became <unk> to lower price quotes when sell programs are in progress 
 on days when prices are tumbling they must be willing to buy shares from sellers when no one else will 
 in such an environment market makers can suffer huge losses both on trades made that day at steadily dropping prices and in the value of their inventories of shares 
 it makes no sense for us to put money at risk when you know you 're going to lose says mr. <unk> of donaldson lufkin 
 but this <unk> mr. <unk> says is creating liquidity problems in certain otc stocks 
 it 's harder to sell stocks when the sell programs come in because some market makers do n't want to take the orders 
 no one has big positions and no one wants to take big risks 
 joseph <unk> president of the national association of securities dealers which oversees trading on nasdaq agrees that program trading is hurting the market 's efforts to bring back small investors 
 but he observes while makers suffer losses when program trading <unk> the market down they also make money when program trading <unk> the prices higher 
 sometimes traders lose sight of that he says 
 the otc stocks in the s&p N include nasdaq 's biggest such as apple computer mci communications tele-communications and <unk> <unk> 
 these big stocks greatly influence the nasdaq composite index 
 when the computers say sell the composite <unk> as well as the dow jones industrial average 
 the problem market makers say is that while the industrial average and the s&p N usually recover as buy programs kick in the nasdaq composite frequently is left behind 
 eight trading days after oct. N the day before the stock market plunge for instance the nasdaq composite had fallen N N compared with N N for the s&p N N N for the new york stock exchange composite index and N N for the industrial average 
 this gap eventually closes but slowly 
 three days later as of friday 's close the nasdaq composite was down N N compared with N N for the industrial average N N for the s&p N and N N for the big board composite 
 the main reason for this lag is that individual investors own N N of the otc market 's capitalization according to mr. <unk> much more than on the big board 
 such investors tend to be more cautious than institutional investors are about <unk> the market after massive <unk> market makers say

 london share prices closed sharply lower friday in active trading after chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson 's resignation <unk> the market and wall street 's rapid initial sell-off knocked it down 
 london shares were depressed initially by overnight losses in new york and by the drop in sterling after mr. lawson 's resignation

 when michael s. <unk> took the <unk> at a recent cosmetics industry event more than N executives <unk> the room snapped to attention 
 mr. <unk> who runs unilever group 's world-wide <unk> business <unk> to <unk> the crowd 
 i see we have about half the audience working for us he said <unk> in <unk> 
 the other half we may have before long 
 members of the audience <unk> or <unk> nervously their industry has been unsettled recently by acquisitions 
 first unilever the <unk> packaged-goods giant spent $ N billion to acquire brands such as faberge and elizabeth <unk> 
 it now holds the no. N position at u.s. department-store cosmetic <unk> 
 then procter & gamble co. agreed to buy noxell corp. for $ N billion 
 that acquisition to be completed by year end will include the cover girl and <unk> makeup lines making p&g the top marketer of cosmetics in mass-market outlets 
 it 's not so much the idea of acquisitions that has <unk> the cosmetics industry as the companies doing the acquiring p&g and unilever bring with them great experience with mundane products like soap and toilet paper <unk> <unk> in the <unk> cosmetics trade but they also bring <unk> marketing clout <unk> fear 
 though it is far from certain that companies best known for selling promise <unk> and tide detergent will succeed in cosmetics there 's little doubt they will shake up the industry 
 for now both companies are keeping quiet about their specific plans 
 but industry watchers expect them to <unk> the <unk> marketing strategies they use for more mundane products with the more <unk> approach typical of cosmetics companies 
 likely changes include more emphasis on research soaring advertising budgets and aggressive pricing 
 but some <unk> executives wonder whether techniques <unk> in packaged goods will translate to the cosmetics business 
 <unk> lauder inc. <unk> inc. and other cosmetics houses traditionally have considered themselves fashion enterprises whose product development is <unk> by the creative <unk> of their executives 
 cosmetics companies roll out new makeup colors several times a year and since most products can be easily <unk> by competitors they 're loath to test them with consumers 
 just because upscale cosmetics look like packaged goods and <unk> like packaged goods it does n't mean they are packaged goods says leonard lauder chief executive of <unk> lauder 
 they 're really fashion items <unk> up in little <unk> 
 in contrast to the more artistic nature of traditional cosmetics houses unilever and p&g are the <unk> of organization men in <unk> suits 
 both companies are conservative marketers that rely on extensive market research 
 p&g in particular rarely rolls out a product nationally before extensive <unk> 
 both can be extremely aggressive at pricing such products as <unk> and <unk> to the extent that some industry consultants predict <unk> coupons for <unk> could result from their entry into the field 
 p&g already has shown it can <unk> some traditional packaged-goods techniques with the <unk> of the cosmetics trade in the mass-market end of the business 
 consider oil of <unk> which p&g acquired as part of <unk> international in N 
 the <unk> introduced in N had a <unk> image 
 oil of <unk> brought with it the <unk> of being used basically by older women who had already aged says david williams a consultant with new england consulting group 
 p&g set out to <unk> the brand by <unk> the product line to include <unk> <unk> and <unk> for sensitive skin 
 it also <unk> oil of <unk> 's packaging <unk> the traditional <unk> boxes with gold lines to create a more <unk> look 
 moreover p&g shifted its ad campaign from one targeting older women to one featuring a woman in her <unk> <unk> not to grow old <unk> 
 the company says sales have soared 
 <unk> like unilever and p&g have enormous financial advantages over smaller rivals 
 next year noxell plans to roll out a <unk> called navy says george l. <unk> jr. chairman of noxell 
 without p&g 's backing noxell might not have been able to spend the estimated $ N million to $ N million needed to accomplish that without <unk> on its existing brands 
 packaged-goods companies will make it tougher for smaller people to remain competitive mr. <unk> says 
 further <unk> in the industry could follow 
 rumors that unilever is interested in acquiring schering-plough corp. 's <unk> unit are widespread 
 unilever wo n't comment <unk> however denies the brand is for sale 
 the presence of unilever and p&g is likely to increase the impact of advertising on cosmetics 
 while the two are among the world 's biggest advertisers most makers of upscale cosmetics spend relatively little on national ads 
 instead they focus on events in department stores and pour their promotional budgets into gifts that go along with purchases 
 <unk> lauder for example spends only an estimated N N of sales on advertising in the u.s. and mr. lauder says he has no plans to change his strategy 
 the most dramatic changes however probably will come in <unk> development 
 nearly N N of cosmetics sales come through <unk> outlets such as drug stores and supermarkets according to andrew shore an analyst at shearson lehman hutton inc 
 that figure has been <unk> up for several years 
 as the trend continues demand for mass-market items that are high quality but only <unk> particularly <unk> products is expected to increase 
 this fall for example <unk> group ordinarily a high-end line rolled out a <unk> line of <unk> products called <unk> which retail for $ N to $ N 
 the packaged-goods marketers may try filling that gap with a spate of new products 
 unlike the <unk> cosmetics houses unilever and p&g both have enormous research and development bases to draw on for new products 
 p&g in fact is noted for gaining market leadership by introducing products that offer a technical edge over the competition 
 sales of its tide detergent soared earlier this year for example after p&g introduced a version that includes a <unk> safe for all colors and <unk> 
 that 's led industry executives to speculate that future product development will be driven more by technological innovation than by fashion <unk> especially among mass-market brands 
 there will be more emphasis on quality says guy <unk> chief executive of <unk> inc. the u.s. <unk> of <unk> 
 you 'll see fewer <unk> 
 but success for unilever and p&g is far from guaranteed as shown by the many <unk> companies that have tried and failed to master the <unk> beauty business 
 in the 1970s several pharmaceutical and packaged-goods companies including colgate-palmolive co. eli lilly & co. pfizer inc. and schering-plough acquired cosmetics companies 
 industry consultants say only schering-plough which makes the mass-market <unk> has maintained a meaningful business 
 colgate which acquired <unk> <unk> in N sold the brand seven years later after the brand <unk> 
 unilever already has experienced some disappointment 
 the mass-market <unk> brand which it acquired in N along with <unk> 's inc. has lost share according to industry analysts 
 the <unk> world of department-store cosmetics retailing where unilever is concentrating its efforts may prove even more <unk> 
 in this niche makeup colors change seasonally because they are linked to <unk> <unk> 
 because brand loyalty is weak and most cosmetics purchases are <unk> careful training of store sales staffs by cosmetics companies is important 
 and <unk> a luxury image strong enough to persuade consumers to pay more than $ N for <unk> or eye makeup requires a <unk> touch that packaged-goods companies have yet to demonstrate on their own 
 there may be a truce in the long war of nerves between the white house and congress over how this country <unk> secret intelligence operations abroad 
 after years of <unk> born of <unk> past <unk> of the central intelligence agency and the iran-contra scandal president bush and the senate intelligence committee appear ready for now at least to trust each other when it comes to setting policy on covert activities 
 if that attitude lasts it could <unk> covert action planning with a level of care and confidence that has n't been seen in years 
 over the past week the president has agreed to keep the committee informed usually in advance of covert actions and to put key intelligence decisions in writing 
 that was n't always the way the reagan administration handled such matters 
 mr. bush has pledged as well to respect the 14-year-old executive order barring u.s. agents from <unk> foreign leaders or helping others to do so 
 congress never fully trusted former cia chief william <unk> and national security adviser john <unk> to honor the ban 
 despite objections by the cia mr. bush also has agreed to the establishment of an inspector general at the cia who would be independent of the cia director 
 in return the senate panel has dropped efforts to enact legislation requiring the administration to inform it within N hours of the launching of any covert activity 
 it also has removed a ban on cia use of a <unk> fund for covert acts and has agreed to wipe away some <unk> and <unk> restrictions on coup planning put in place to ensure that the cia did n't get back in the assassination game 
 we 've finally been able to convince them that <unk> and oliver north do n't work here anymore says one administration official 
 the new understanding did n't just spring to life in a <unk> <unk> of <unk> and light 
 it emerged after a <unk> display of <unk> intelligence politics that followed this month 's failed coup attempt in panama 
 the white house used television appearances and leaks to argue that <unk> imposed restrictions on covert actions made u.s. support for such coups difficult 
 mr. bush even disclosed privately that one <unk> deal with congress required him to notify the <unk> panamanian dictator manuel noriega if the u.s. learned of a coup plot that might endanger his life 
 the president also hinted he might veto this year 's intelligence authorization bill if it is too restrictive 
 intelligence committee chairman david boren d. <unk> and vice chairman william cohen r. maine for their part <unk> accused the white house of <unk> <unk> classified documents and trying unfairly to shift the blame to congress for the <unk> attempt to topple gen. noriega 
 the white house got the better of the exchange but took care not to press its advantage to the kind of constitutional confrontation sought by conservative republicans who do n't want any congressional oversight of intelligence activities 
 instead mr. bush and his aides made it clear they respected congress 's role and felt they could work with the conservative mr. boren and the moderate mr. cohen to iron out their differences 
 the senators responded in kind 
 sen. boren <unk> told reporters that there had been a meeting of the minds with the white house and that the committee had given mr. bush a clean slate free of the <unk> imposed during the reagan years 
 sen. cohen said the relationship has <unk> to its <unk> character 
 there still are some details to be <unk> down 
 mr. bush is <unk> the right in rare <unk> to keep congress in the dark <unk> a constitutional <unk> the committee does n't recognize 
 and a pending justice department interpretation of the assassination ban could raise questions that would have to be settled 
 moreover both sides may face political critics 
 some conservatives will accuse the president of promising congress too much 
 and they continue <unk> attacking cia director william webster for being too <unk> to the committee 
 at the same time some congressional liberals will accuse sens. boren and cohen of <unk> out and they will warn that the lawmakers ' concessions raise the specter of more internationally embarrassing covert operations like the mining of nicaraguan harbors and the iran arms sales 
 but if the cooperative attitude holds and there is greater <unk> on covert activities the country could be entering an era when such <unk> schemes are scrapped before they get off the drawing boards while risky but <unk> secret operations can be undertaken without fear that a <unk> congress will <unk> 
 several of the new york stock exchange 's own listed companies led by giant contel corp. are joining for the first time to complain about program trading and the exchange 's role in it 
 claiming program trading has turned the big board into a gambling casino contel chairman charles wohlstetter said that he and at least N other corporate executives are forming an unprecedented alliance 
 the group mr. wohlstetter said in an interview wants to end the market 's wild price swings that critics blame on <unk> program-trading strategies 
 the group will complain to washington to the heads of program-trading firms and to the heads of the big board itself he said 
 they should call the exchange trump east charged mr. wohlstetter the <unk> founder of contel who 's also a former investment banker and stock trader 
 what is the mission of the financial community 
 to help some <unk> or <unk> or help corporate america 
 contel is a $ N billion telephone and electronics company 
 pressure has been building on the big board in the past two weeks to do something about market volatility which many investors say is caused by program trading 
 the market 's friday-the-13th plunge of N points in the dow jones industrial average and the big board 's <unk> response to it galvanized some longstanding <unk> among companies listed on the exchange 
 last month program trading accounted for a record N N of average daily big board volume 
 mr. wohlstetter for example said he wrote to big board chairman john j. phelan jr. about program trading after the 190-point dow plunge and as in previous <unk> what i get back is <unk> 
 he said he 's upset that mr. phelan trying to calm investors after the plunge said that investors would simply have to get used to the market 's big price swings 
 the big board is partly to blame for the price swings because they 're <unk> said mr. wohlstetter 
 their powerful members manage them 
 the focus of the outcry has been stock-index arbitrage which accounts for about half the program trading that goes on 
 index arbitragers argue that their trading is healthy because it links markets but critics say such trading <unk> market movements and increases the chance for a crash 
 the big board has refused to be drawn into a public debate about program trading 
 richard <unk> big board president last week said only that the exchange is concerned about all its constituents 
 privately exchange officials worry that without a <unk> system for program trading at the big board billions of dollars in trading will simply <unk> to overseas exchanges such as london 's 
 it is partly for this reason that the exchange last week began trading in its own stock basket product that allows big investors to buy or sell all N stocks in the standard & poor 's index in a single trade 
 one intended customer of the new basket product is index arbitragers according to the exchange 
 investors have complained for some time about program trading particularly index arbitrage to little <unk> 
 but according to some big board traders an organized campaign from <unk> companies might make the exchange finally consider big changes 
 they wo n't fight the listed companies 
 now the assault is on said one top trader 
 the big board ca n't ban stock-index futures of course but it could ban use of its <unk> electronic trading system for program trading or at least encourage securities firms to back off 
 the exchange put a bit of a <unk> on program trading when last year it simply started to publish monthly statistics of each firm 's program-trading volume 
 contel 's mr. wohlstetter said the group of big board companies is n't ready to go public yet with its effort and that he does n't plan to be the leader once it is public 
 however he said he planned to spend the weekend making calls to gather additional support 
 among those mr. wohlstetter said he has been talking to are sanford <unk> of primerica corp. which is the parent of smith barney harris upham & co. gte corp. 's james johnson and itt corp. 's rand <unk> 
 none of these chief executives were available for comment 
 among the targets of the big board companies ' campaign will be some corporate pension funds that use program-trading strategies to maximize returns on their investments 
 for contel 's part the company a month ago informed each of its money managers that it would drop them if they give business to program-trading firms 
 it was just those kinds of <unk> that last week succeeded in turning up the heat in the debate 
 kemper corp. 's kemper financial services unit said it cut off bear stearns morgan stanley oppenheimer and general electric co. 's kidder peabody & co. unit 
 all of the firms except kidder which is the <unk> program trader on wall street quickly announced <unk> from index arbitrage 
 kidder officials stand by their aggressive use of program trading 
 chief executive officer michael carpenter said that despite the outcry even by some of kidder 's own brokers he believes index arbitrage does n't have a negative impact on the market as a whole 
 however pressure on kidder 's parent ge could change kidder 's policy 
 ge chairman john welch has been besieged with phone calls complaining about his unit 's program trading according to a person close to him 
 margaret thatcher 's <unk> response to the latest upheaval in her government is to promise business as usual 
 that may be the last thing she needs 
 as the air clears from last week 's storm of resignations and <unk> the government faces a <unk> job of rebuilding confidence in its policies 
 the prime minister and her new chancellor of the exchequer the <unk> john major need to haul the country through something like a recession to bring down inflation and set the economy moving again 
 mrs. thatcher has to come to terms with european economic integration beginning with the european monetary system which britain is committed to joining fully someday 
 finally the government has to convince a rattled financial community and voters it is proceeding <unk> toward its goals 
 it sounds like the work of a decade but the deadline is late N when mrs. thatcher is expected to call another national election 
 what 's worrying her supporters is that the economic cycle may be out of <unk> with the political timetable 
 she could end up seeking a fourth term in an economy sick with inflation high interest rates and a heavy trade deficit 
 though mrs. thatcher has pulled through other crises supporters wonder if her <unk> <unk> ways are the right formula today 
 there 's a rising fear that perhaps mrs. thatcher 's style of management has become a political liability says bill martin senior economist at london brokers <unk> & drew 
 the prime minister 's insistence on keeping a private <unk> of advisers including an economic <unk> who openly criticized former chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson confused the financial community 
 last week the strategy of playing the two experts off each other <unk> up mr. lawson quit in <unk> and sir alan walters the adviser announced his resignation within an hour 
 the confusion could be costly 
 currency traders <unk> mr. major wo n't defend the pound <unk> sent the british currency sharply lower friday against the dollar and west german mark 
 analysts expect further jitters this week 
 a continuing slide in the pound could force the government to push through another rise in the base rate currently N N 
 that could <unk> a weak economy into recession 
 economists have been anticipating a slump for months but they now say it will be deeper and longer than they had thought 
 britain 's economy is developing rapidly toward <unk> says j. paul <unk> international economist with smith barney harris upham co. in paris 
 a mild slowdown probably would have run its course by early N economists say while the <unk> downturn now expected could stretch into N 
 recovery could be hampered if britain 's major trading partners in europe which are enjoying robust economic activity cool off as expected in late N and N 
 that would leave mrs. thatcher little room for maneuver 
 for the <unk> to win the next election voters will need to sense economic improvement for about a year <unk> 
 though mrs. thatcher does n't need to call an election until june N she would prefer doing so in late N 
 if the economy shows no sign of turning around in about year 's time she will be very vulnerable says john <unk> a <unk> at the london school of economics 
 there 's an equally pressing deadline for the government to define its monetary and economic ties to the rest of the european community 
 it has sent mixed signals about its willingness to take part in the exchange-rate mechanism of the european monetary system which links the major ec currencies 
 at a june ec summit mrs. thatcher appeared to ease her opposition to full ems membership saying britain would join once its inflation rate fell and the ec <unk> capital movements 
 since then the government has left observers wondering if it ever meant to join 
 sir alan <unk> the monetary arrangement as <unk> in an article being published in an american economics journal 
 that produced little reaction from his boss reinforcing speculation the government would use its two conditions as a <unk> for avoiding full ems membership 
 despite the departure of mr. lawson and sir alan the <unk> over the ems could continue 
 sir <unk> <unk> deputy prime minister and a lawson ally on the ems has signaled he will continue pressing for early membership 
 of immediate concern is whether the thatcher government will continue mr. lawson 's policy of tracking the monetary policies of the west german <unk> and responding in kind when the frankfurt authorities move interest rates 
 mrs. thatcher does n't like taking orders from foreigners says tim <unk> economist with <unk> & national holding plc 
 as conservatives rally around mrs. thatcher during the crisis many harbor hopes last week 's debacle will prompt change 
 we wo n't have any more of this <unk> behavior says sir peter <unk> a <unk> <unk> member of parliament 
 the party is fed up with <unk> of good people 
 it 's an <unk> expectation 
 as long as a decade ago mrs. thatcher declared she did n't want debate in her cabinet she wanted strong government 
 over the weekend she said she did n't intend to change her style and denied she is <unk> 
 nonsense she told an <unk> yesterday on london weekend television

 when <unk> take on more <unk> they tend to substitute for chores done by the kids rather than by the wife 
 rand corp. researchers linda <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> a large sample of married women with at least one child at home between the ages of six and N 
 the women indicated which family member usually did various household chores and the <unk> share each did 
 not unexpectedly wives whether working or <unk> did by far the most about N N of the shopping <unk> and cooking and about two-thirds of <unk> <unk> <unk> child care and family paper work 
 only for <unk> and home maintenance did women do less than half 
 but the researchers found that while children 's household tasks eased the mother 's burden <unk> the husband 's helping hand appears to <unk> the children 's load almost on a <unk> basis and to reduce the wife 's responsibility only modestly 
 this pattern was particularly evident among more highly educated couples 
 in these families <unk> took on N N more chores than in couples with only <unk> school education 
 but the kids with highly educated parents did N N less <unk> than those in <unk> families 
 it is clear ms. <unk> says that most of the effect of increasing education has been to shift who is helping the <unk>

 nursing home patients apt to be private <unk> 
 far fewer elderly nursing home residents bankrupt themselves than was previously believed two recent studies declare 
 state governments place very low <unk> on how much property people may own or how much income they may keep if they want welfare help on medical bills 
 conventional wisdom has long held that anywhere from <unk> to one-half of all elderly long-term care patients are obliged to spend themselves into poverty before <unk> for medicaid assistance 
 but separate reports from <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> of the <unk> institution and <unk> <unk> of the urban institute find that a surprisingly small proportion only about N N of residents start out as private <unk> but spend down to medicaid levels in a single nursing home stay before they die or are <unk> 
 another one-third are already on medicaid when they enter the nursing homes a considerably higher proportion than the analysts anticipated 
 but a <unk> high percentage over half are private <unk> throughout their stay even a fairly lengthy one 
 about one-third pay out of their own pockets while the rest are covered throughout by medicare private insurers or the veterans administration 
 both reports are based on several thousand patients <unk> in a N nationwide government survey 
 the <unk> and urban institute authors caution however that most nursing home stays are of <unk> short <unk> and reaching the medicaid level is more likely with an unusually long stay or repeated stays 
 moreover they note those who manage to pay their own way often do so only by selling their homes using up life savings or drawing heavily on children and other <unk> 
 reagan era young hold liberal views 
 the reagan generation young men and women reaching political maturity during ronald reagan 's presidency are firmly liberal on race and <unk> according to <unk> the social science research center at the university of chicago 
 many political analysts have speculated that the reagan years would produce a <unk> conservative younger generation 
 <unk> 's most recent opinion surveys find the youngest adults indeed somewhat more <unk> and <unk> than other adults 
 but says chief investigator tom smith this does not translate into support for <unk> in general or into conservative positions on <unk> and civil rights issues 
 answers to a dozen questions in the N N N and N national surveys reveal that men and women in the N to N age <unk> are considerably more liberal on race and <unk> than were the N to N year <unk> in <unk> 's <unk> in the early 1970s and early 1980s 
 they were also as liberal or more liberal than any other age group in the N through N surveys 
 for example N N of the N to N year <unk> in the four latest surveys favored an open housing law <unk> homeowners from refusing on racial grounds to sell to prospective buyers 
 that compares with N N of the similar age group in the N through N surveys and N N in the N through N surveys

 october was an <unk> month for the practitioners of glasnost the official soviet policy of allowing more <unk> from the nation 's media 
 for one of the <unk> of glasnost <unk> korotich editor of the <unk> weekly <unk> friday oct. N was a <unk> day that turned from tension to <unk> 
 he had been summoned to the central committee of the soviet communist party after he finished his lunch at the <unk> hotel an unlikely prelude to a bureaucratic <unk> <unk> <unk> naked <unk> float on their <unk> toward a ceiling <unk> with <unk> all surrounded by <unk> laid on with a <unk> <unk> 's <unk> and supported by marble <unk> columns whose <unk> are <unk> <unk> of gold 
 why had mr. korotich been called 
 i told my driver he said that he was taking my <unk> to the central committee so they can <unk> <unk> <unk> his hand made vigorous <unk> gestures on his left palm 
 they feel the need from time to time to educate me 
 and indeed as he later reported that was the import of the meeting 
 anxious allies of president mikhail gorbachev are <unk> media leaders to take it easy to be careful not to do anything that could be used by mr. gorbachev 's opponents 
 the government is nervous 
 according to mr. korotich who was present mr. gorbachev 's publicized <unk> of the press on oct. N was more of a plea be careful boys use good judgment 
 we 're standing in gasoline so do n't smoke 
 u.s. and northern european diplomats confirm mr. korotich 's assessment that glasnost is in no immediate danger 
 in fact a very <unk> soviet official told an american official at a diplomatic dinner that no change in the policy was contemplated 
 the day after that conversation at the residence of the u.s. ambassador the <unk> editor of pravda victor <unk> was replaced by a college <unk> of mr. gorbachev 's 
 <unk> <unk> have more to fear from mr. gorbachev than the <unk> <unk> he gave to the press 
 at the end of the very week in which mr. korotich was called to the central committee <unk> was again <unk> its independence by printing a poll that showed that N N of the soviet population a <unk> believed that mr. gorbachev 's economic reforms perestroika would result in only <unk> change 
 a good measurement of the popularity of <unk> <unk> like <unk> is circulation 
 when mr. korotich took it over in N it sold N copies today it sells N million 
 pravda meanwhile has retained only N N of its N <unk> 
 glasnost has made <unk> of men like mr. korotich 
 prevented by the communist party from getting on its slate of <unk> for the new supreme soviet he stood as an independent candidate for congress from his native <unk> and won with N N of the vote 
 the same evening that he was summoned for a warning from the party he was cheered by thousands of his supporters at a rally of what can only be called the korotich party 
 but as <unk> as the changes that have already occurred are there is a <unk> to glasnost 
 censorship is n't a marxist <unk>

 so glasnost is not a value <unk> with steel <unk> into the fabric of russian society 
 it is an <unk> public relations program initiated by a single political leader during a four-year <unk> of history 
 it is public relations of the highest <unk> that recognizes that credibility is enhanced by honesty up to a point 
 what is that point 
 will <unk> begin a series of reports analyzing the failures of perestroika 
 i 'd be destroying myself replies mr. korotich who then asks what would that accomplish 
 his answer reveals his <unk> it also draws the line that soviet society must cross to enter the normal dialogue of western culture 
 it is the line beyond which the press can report not only on the bankruptcy of factories but on the failures of even <unk> leaders

 mr. greenspan 's decision to keep quiet also prompted a <unk> within the fed 's ranks 
 a senior fed official spoke on saturday after the market <unk> to both the washington post and the new york times saying the fed was prepared to provide as much credit as the markets needed 
 the statement angered chairman greenspan but it was greeted with applause by the bush administration and the financial markets 
 and while the <unk> fed member has n't gone public some fed governors most notably vice chairman manuel johnson are known to have disagreed with the chairman 's decision to remain silent 
 ironically the <unk> official 's comments have earned some <unk> for mr. greenspan who is mistakenly seen as the source 
 at a hearing last week democratic sen. chris dodd of connecticut told treasury secretary nicholas brady that chairman greenspan 's announcement over the oct. N weekend was a very important statement 
 mr. brady <unk> replied that he was n't sure whether mr. greenspan made a statement himself or whether that was a newspaper report 
 the fed chairman 's caution was apparent again on the monday morning after the market 's plunge when the central bank took only modest steps to aid the markets 
 a surprisingly small amount of reserves was added to the banking system 
 and by the end of that week the key federal funds interest rate which is largely controlled by the fed had settled at N N barely changed from the level of just under N N that prevailed the previous week 
 bush administration officials appear increasingly concerned that mr. greenspan is cautious to a fault 
 signs of growing weakness in the economy <unk> with indications that inflation is staying well under control have caused them to wonder why the fed chairman is so <unk> in reducing rates 
 those concerns are n't expressed in public 
 in fact the administration and the fed have been going out of their way in the past two weeks to <unk> any impression that they are at odds <unk> stories about an <unk> split added to the stock market 's jitters 
 still the split is there 
 the administration 's concerns are <unk> 
 the economy is showing signs of weakness particularly among manufacturers 
 exports which played a key role in fueling growth over the last two years seem to have stalled 
 factory <unk> and production fell in september and the auto industry and housing are in a severe crunch 
 but mr. greenspan remains reluctant to loosen policy partly because he faces a <unk> of presidents of regional fed banks who oppose credit easing 
 in addition the chairman has a wary eye aimed a year or two down the road 
 inflation may be stable at the moment running at about N N 
 but if the fed <unk> too soon mr. greenspan fears prices may begin to accelerate again next year 
 moreover if the fed holds tight it may be able gradually to reduce inflation moving toward the <unk> goal that the fed chairman embraced in testimony to congress last week 
 so far mr. greenspan 's cautious approach to policy has served both him and the nation well 
 his hand on the monetary <unk> seems one reason why the economy next month seems highly likely to begin an unprecedented eighth year of <unk> growth without a recession 
 we 've gotten through two stock market crashes and we 've gone through an election without any major problems says david <unk> an economist of kemper financial services 
 i think you have to give greenspan a good rating 
 but such caution is no guarantee against mistakes 
 the fed 's reluctance to ease credit now could be laying the <unk> for a new recession perhaps starting early next year 
 if that happens chairman greenspan could well become an open target 
 already congress is <unk> with legislation to curb the fed 's independence 
 if the economy turns down such proposals could gain strong momentum

 in an age of <unk> the federal judiciary is one of the last <unk> of the <unk> 
 a judge must jump from murder to antitrust cases from <unk> to securities fraud without missing a beat 
 but even on the federal bench <unk> is creeping in and it has become a subject of sharp controversy on the newest federal appeals court 
 the court of appeals for the federal circuit was created in N to serve among other things as the court of last resort for most patent disputes 
 previously patent cases moved through the court system to one of the N circuit appeals courts 
 there judges who saw few such cases and had no experience in the field <unk> with some of the most technical and complex disputes <unk> 
 a new specialty court was sought by patent experts who believed that the <unk> had <unk> too many important multimillion-dollar cases 
 some patent lawyers had hoped that such a specialty court would be filled with experts in the field 
 but the reagan administration thought otherwise and so may the bush administration 
 since N the president has filled four <unk> in the federal circuit court with <unk> lawyers 
 now only three of the N judges <unk> <unk> chief judge howard t. markey N and <unk> rich N have <unk> backgrounds 
 the latter two and judge daniel m. <unk> N are approaching senior status or retirement 
 three seats currently are vacant and three others are likely to be filled within a few years so patent lawyers and <unk> industries are making a new push for specialists to be added to the court 
 several organizations including the industrial <unk> association and the pharmaceutical manufacturers association have asked the white house and justice department to name candidates with both patent and scientific backgrounds 
 the associations would like the court to include between three and six judges with specialized training 
 some of the associations have recommended dr. alan d. <unk> N a former patent agent with a <unk> in organic chemistry who now is associate general counsel with <unk> <unk> corp. in philadelphia 
 dr. <unk> says the justice department interviewed him last july 
 their effort has received a <unk> response from the justice department 
 we do not feel that seats are reserved for patent lawyers says justice spokesman david runkel who declines to say how soon a candidate will be named 
 but we will take it into consideration 
 the justice department 's view is shared by other lawyers and at least one member of the court judge h. robert mayer a former civil <unk> who served at the claims court trial level before he was appointed to the federal circuit two years ago 
 i believe that any good lawyer should be able to figure out and understand patent law judge mayer says adding that it 's the responsibility of highly paid lawyers who argue before the court to make us understand complex patent litigation 
 yet some lawyers point to eli lilly & co. vs. <unk> inc. the patent infringement case the supreme court this month agreed to review as an example of poor legal <unk> by judges who lack patent litigation experience 
 judge mayer was not on the <unk> panel 
 in the lilly case the appeals court broadly <unk> a federal statute to grant <unk> a medical device manufacturer an exemption to <unk> a patent under certain circumstances 
 if the supreme court holds in <unk> 's favor the decision will have billion-dollar consequences for the manufacturers of medical devices color and food <unk> and all other <unk> products that required food & drug administration approval 
 <unk> <unk> a lawyer and director of government relations for the industrial <unk> association contends that a judge <unk> in patent law and the concerns of <unk> industries would have ruled otherwise 
 and judge <unk> a former patent lawyer wrote in her dissent when the court denied a motion for a <unk> of the case by the full court the panel 's judicial legislation has affected an important <unk> industry without regard to the consequences for research and innovation or the public interest 
 says ms. <unk> the judgment confirms our concern that the absence of patent lawyers on the court could prove troublesome

 kidder peabody & co. is trying to struggle back 
 only a few months ago the <unk> securities firm seemed to be on the verge of a <unk> racked by internal <unk> and <unk> 
 its relationship with parent general electric co. had been <unk> since a big kidder insider-trading scandal two years ago 
 chief executives and presidents had come and gone 
 now the firm says it 's at a turning point 
 by the end of this year <unk> chairman <unk> cathcart the former chairman of illinois tool works who was <unk> as a <unk> man when ge brought him in to clean up kidder in N <unk> to his lake forest ill. home possibly to build a shopping mall on some land he owns 
 i 've done what i came to do at kidder he says 
 and that means <unk> michael carpenter president and chief executive since january will for the first time take complete control of kidder and try to make good on some <unk> plans 
 mr. carpenter says he will return kidder to <unk> as a great investment bank 
 wall street is <unk> skeptical 
 through the first nine months of the year kidder ranks a distant <unk> among underwriters of u.s. stocks and bonds with a N N market share up slightly from N N in the year-earlier period according to securities data co 
 it 's quite a fall from the early 1980s when kidder still was counted as an investment-banking powerhouse 
 gary s. <unk> president of the <unk> group an executive search firm said i 'd like to see kidder succeed 
 but they have to attract good senior bankers who can bring in the business from day one 
 in N kidder <unk> out a $ N million profit mainly because of severe cost cutting 
 its <unk> brokerage operation reported an estimated $ N million loss last year although kidder expects it to turn a profit this year 
 in fact kidder is a minor player in just about every business it does except computer-driven program trading in that controversial business only morgan stanley & co. rivals kidder 
 but even that niche is under attack as several wall street firms pulled back from program trading last week under pressure from big investors 
 mr. carpenter a former <unk> executive who has a love for task forces says he has done a complete <unk> of kidder in recent months 
 there have been a dizzying parade of studies of the firm 's operations 
 more than N new managing directors and senior vice presidents have been hired since january 
 the firm 's brokerage force has been trimmed and its <unk> staff increased to a record N people 
 mr. carpenter says that when he assumes full control kidder will finally tap the resources of ge 
 one of ge 's goals when it bought N N of kidder in N was to take advantage of <unk> between kidder and general electric capital corp. ge 's <unk> unit which has $ N billion in assets 
 the leveraged buy-out group of ge capital now reports to mr. carpenter 
 so far instead of <unk> up ge capital staffers and kidder investment bankers have <unk> 
 yet says mr. carpenter we 've really started to exploit the <unk> between ge capital and kidder peabody 
 the units have worked on N investment banking deals this year he says though not all of them have <unk> out 
 we 've had a good relationship with ge which is the first time you could say that <unk> let me withdraw that 
 it 's been a steadily improving relationship says mr. carpenter 
 still without many actual deals to show off kidder is left to stress that it finally has a team in place and that everyone works harder 
 a month ago the firm started serving dinner at about N each night about N to N of the N people in the investment banking operation have consistently been around that late 
 we are working significantly longer and harder than has been the case in the past says scott c. <unk> kidder 's head of investment banking since june 
 everywhere kidder <unk> the always working theme 
 a new in-house magazine kidder world which will focus on the firm 's <unk> strategy says mr. carpenter <unk> that on <unk> mr. <unk> often gets <unk> ideas while flying his <unk> <unk> <unk> on the way to <unk> 
 the firm 's new head of mergers and acquisitions under mr. <unk> <unk> <unk> talks of the opportunity to rebuild a franchise at kidder 
 the kidder name is one of only six or seven that every ceo recognizes as a viable alternative when considering a merger deal he says 
 now according to a kidder world story about mr. <unk> all the firm has to do is position ourselves more in the deal flow 
 with investment banking as kidder 's lead business where do kidder 's <unk> brokerage network and its N brokers fit in 
 mr. carpenter this month sold off kidder 's eight brokerage offices in florida and puerto rico to merrill lynch & co. <unk> speculation that kidder is getting out of the brokerage business entirely 
 mr. carpenter denies the speculation 
 to answer the brokerage question kidder in typical fashion completed a <unk> study 
 the result kidder will focus on rich individual investors and small companies much closer to the <unk> of goldman sachs & co. than a <unk> firm like merrill lynch or shearson lehman hutton inc 
 mr. carpenter notes that these types of investors also are sophisticated enough not to complain about kidder 's aggressive use of program trading 
 as part of the upscale push kidder is putting brokers through a <unk> training course turning them into investment <unk> with knowledge of corporate finance 
 they will get new and improved tools to sell particularly to the affluent investor says brokerage chief charles v. <unk> 
 <unk> the brokers will then be able to <unk> leads on corporate finance opportunities to kidder 's investment bankers possibly easing the longstanding tension between the two camps 
 however skeptics caution that this kind of <unk> between brokers and investment bankers looks great on paper but does n't always happen 
 kidder competitors are n't <unk> hostile to the firm as many are to a tough competitor like drexel burnham lambert inc. that does n't have kidder 's long history 
 however competitors say that kidder 's hiring binge involving <unk> staffers some with <unk> contract guarantees could <unk> unless there are results 
 the <unk> mr. cathcart says he has no worries about kidder 's future 
 mr. cathcart who will return to the <unk> <unk> co. board of directors in addition to his personal ventures is credited with bringing some basic <unk> and planning discipline to traditionally <unk> kidder 
 he also improved the firm 's compliance procedures for trading 
 mr. cathcart says he has had a lot of fun at kidder adding the crack about his being a <unk> man never bothered him 
 it was an absolutely <unk> line and one i used many times he says 
 smiling broadly when he talks about mr. carpenter mr. cathcart says the new kidder chief is going to be recognized shortly as one of the real leaders in the investment-banking business 
 in coming years mr. cathcart says kidder is <unk> <unk> <unk> 
 or as mr. carpenter again drawing on his <unk> background puts it we 're ready to implement at this point

 in what could prove a major addition to the philippines ' <unk> portfolio a taiwanese company signed a $ N million construction contract to build the centerpiece of a planned petrochemical complex 
 taiwan 's <unk> far east corp. a petrochemical company <unk> the agreement with an unidentified japanese contractor to build a <unk> <unk> according to <unk> lee who heads the philippine company set up to build and operate the complex 
 mr. lee president of luzon petrochemical corp. said the contract was signed wednesday in tokyo with <unk> far east officials 
 contract details however have n't been made public 
 the complex is to be located in <unk> about N miles south of manila 
 <unk> far east will hold a N N stake in luzon petrochemical according to papers signed with the philippine government 's board of investments 
 the proposed petrochemical plant would use <unk> to manufacture the petrochemicals <unk> and <unk> and their <unk> <unk> <unk> and polyethylene 
 these are the raw materials used in making plastics 
 the contract signing represented a major step in the <unk> petrochemical project 
 at an estimated $ N million the project would represent the single largest foreign investment in the philippines since president <unk> aquino took office in february N 
 it also is considered critical to the country 's efforts to both attract other investment from taiwan and raise heavy industry <unk> 
 the project has been in and out of the pipeline for more than a decade 
 however workers ca n't break ground until legal <unk> to block the complex are resolved moves which caused the signing to remain questionable up to the last moment 
 as previously reported a member of the philippines ' house of representatives has sued to stop the plant 
 the legislator <unk> garcia had actively backed the plant but at the original site in his constituency northwest of manila 
 the country 's supreme court dismissed the suit but mr. garcia late last month filed for a <unk> 
 in addition president aquino has yet to sign into law a bill removing a stiff N N tax on <unk> the principal raw material to be used in the <unk> 
 however at a news conference thursday mrs. aquino backed the project and said her government was attempting to <unk> the feelings of residents at the original site adjacent to the government 's major petroleum refinery in <unk> province 
 we have tried our best to tell the people in <unk> that maybe this time it will not go to them but certainly we will do our best to encourage other investors to go to their province mrs. aquino told <unk> foreign <unk> 
 the project appeared to be on the rocks earlier this month when the other major partner in the project china general plastics corp. backed out 
 china general plastics another taiwanese petrochemical manufacturer was to have a N N stake in luzon petrochemical 
 however mr. lee said that <unk> far east is confident other investors will take up the slack 
 he said <unk> far east has applied to both the asian development bank and the world bank 's international finance corp. for financing that could include equity stakes

 president bush insists it would be a great tool for curbing the budget deficit and <unk> the <unk> out of government programs 
 he wants it now 
 not so fast says rep. <unk> edwards of oklahoma a fellow republican 
 i consider it one of the <unk> ideas of the 20th century he says 
 it 's the line-item veto a procedure that would allow the president to kill individual items in a big spending bill passed by congress without <unk> the entire bill 
 whatever one thinks of the idea it 's far more than the budgetary <unk> it may seem at first <unk> 
 rather it 's a device that could send shock waves through the president 's entire relationship with democrats and republicans alike in congress fundamentally enhance the power of the presidency and transform the way the government does its business 
 president bush badly wants a line-item veto and has long called for a law giving it to the president 
 now the white house is declaring that he might not rely on congress which has n't shown any willingness to surrender such authority to pass the line-item veto law he seeks 
 white house spokesmen last week said mr. bush is considering simply declaring that the constitution gives him the power exercising a line-item veto and inviting a court challenge to decide whether he has the right 
 although that may sound like an <unk> maneuver of little interest outside washington it would set off a political earthquake 
 the <unk> are enormous says rep. don edwards a california democrat who is a senior member of the house judiciary committee 
 it 's a real face-to-face arm <unk> challenge to congress 
 white house aides know it 's a step that ca n't be taken <unk> and for that reason the president may back down from launching a test case this year 
 some senior advisers argue that with further fights over a capital-gains tax cut and a <unk> bill looming mr. bush already has enough pending <unk> with congress 
 they prefer to put off the line-item veto until at least next year 
 still mr. bush and some other aides are strongly drawn to the idea of trying out a line-item veto 
 the issue arose last week when vice president dan quayle told an audience in chicago that mr. bush was looking for a test case 
 white house press secretary marlin fitzwater confirmed that mr. bush was interested in the idea but cautioned that there was n't a firm decision to try it 
 mr. bush former president reagan and a host of conservative activists have been arguing that a line-item veto would go a long way in restoring discipline to the budget process 
 they maintain that a president needs the ability to <unk> remove pork-barrel spending projects that are attached to big omnibus spending bills 
 those bills ca n't easily be vetoed in their <unk> because they often are needed to keep the government operating 
 conservatives note that N governors have the line-item veto to use on state budgets 
 more <unk> some conservative legal <unk> have begun arguing that mr. bush does n't need to wait for a law giving him the veto because the power already is implicit in the constitution 
 they base their argument on a clause buried in article i section N of the constitution that states every order resolution or vote to which the <unk> of the senate and house of representatives may be necessary except on a question of <unk> shall be presented to the president of the united states and before the same shall take effect shall be approved by him or <unk> by him 
 this clause they argue is designed to go beyond an earlier clause <unk> that the president can veto a bill and is broad enough to allow him to strike out items and riders within bills 
 senate minority leader robert dole r. kan. for one <unk> this argument and earlier this year publicly urged mr. bush to use the line-item veto and allow the courts to decide whether or not it is constitutional 
 there 's little doubt that such a move would be immediately challenged in court and that it would quickly make its way to the supreme court to be ultimately resolved 
 it 's a major issue and they would n't want to leave it at a lower level says stephen <unk> a new york attorney whose <unk> have been instrumental in pushing the idea that a president already has a line-item veto 
 rep. edwards the california democrat is one who <unk> that he would immediately challenge mr. bush in the courts arguing a line-item veto would expand a president 's powers far beyond anything the <unk> of the constitution had in mind 
 it puts this president in the legislative business he declares 
 that 's not what our <unk> had in mind 
 in addition to giving a president powers to rewrite spending bills meant to be written in congress rep. edwards argues a line-item veto would allow the chief executive to <unk> lawmakers 
 he notes that as a <unk> from the san francisco area he fights each year to preserve federal funds for the bay area rapid transit system 
 if a president had a line-item veto and wanted to force him to support a controversial <unk> initiative rep. edwards says the president could call and declare that he would <unk> kill the bart funds unless the congressman <unk> up on the <unk> issue 
 proponents maintain that a president would choose to use a line-item veto more <unk> than that 
 but there may be another problem with the device despite all the political <unk> it would cause it might n't be effective in cutting the deficit 
 big chunks of the government budget like the <unk> programs of social security and medicare would n't be affected 
 governors have found that they have to use the device <unk> to maintain political <unk> 
 and it is n't even clear that some pork-barrel projects can be hit with a line-item veto because they tend to be listed in informal conference reports accompanying spending bills rather than in the official bills themselves 
 still proponents contend that the veto would have what mr. <unk> calls an important <unk> effect on all manner of appropriations bills 
 lawmakers they say would avoid putting many spending projects into legislation in the first place for fear of the embarrassment of having them singled out for a line-item veto later 
 whatever the outcome of a test case president bush would have to move cautiously <unk> the very attempt would <unk> not just democrats but republicans says louis fisher a scholar at the congressional research service who specializes in <unk> relations 
 republicans have as much interest as democrats in the way the system works he notes 
 indeed although a majority of republican lawmakers favor a line-item veto some ranging from liberal oregon sen. mark <unk> to conservative rep. edwards are opposed 
 rep. edwards voices the traditional conservative view that it 's a mistake to put too much power in the hands of a single person 
 conservatives pushing for a line-item veto now he notes may regret it later sometime you 're going to have a democratic president again who 'll use his expanded powers against those very same conservatives 
 every order resolution or vote to which the <unk> of the senate and house of representatives may be necessary except on a question of <unk> shall be presented to the president of the united states and before the same shall take effect shall be approved by him or being <unk> by him shall be <unk> by two-thirds of the senate and house of representatives according to the rules and limitations prescribed in the case of a bill 
 this has n't been kellogg co. 's year 
 the <unk> craze has cost the world 's largest cereal maker market share 
 the company 's president quit suddenly 
 and now kellogg is indefinitely <unk> work on what was to be a $ N billion cereal plant 
 the company said it was delaying construction because of current market conditions 
 but the memphis tenn. facility was n't to begin turning out product until N so the decision may reveal a more pessimistic long-term outlook as well 
 kellogg which has n't been as successful in <unk> on the public 's <unk> desire for oat bran as rival general mills inc. has been losing share in the $ N billion <unk> cereal market 
 kellogg 's current share is believed to be slightly under N N while general mills ' share is about N N 
 led by its <unk> <unk> line general mills has gained an estimated N N share so far this year mostly at the expense of kellogg 
 each share point is worth about $ N million in sales 
 analysts say much of kellogg 's erosion has been in such core brands as corn <unk> rice <unk> and <unk> <unk> which represent nearly one-third of its sales volume 
 kellogg is so anxious to turn around corn <unk> sales that it soon will begin selling boxes for as little as N cents trade sources say 
 <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> have <unk> away sales normally going to kellogg 's <unk> lines simply because they are made of <unk> says merrill lynch food analyst william <unk> 
 they are not a happy group of people at battle creek right now 
 kellogg is based in battle creek mich. a city that calls itself the breakfast capital of the world 
 another analyst john c. maxwell jr. of wheat first securities in richmond va. recently went to a sell recommendation on kellogg stock which closed friday at $ N down N cents in new york stock exchange composite trading 
 i do n't think kellogg can get back to N N this year he said 
 kellogg 's main problem is life style 
 people are reading the boxes and deciding they want something that 's healthy for you <unk> bran 
 mr. maxwell said he would n't be surprised if over the next two years or so general mills ' share increased to N N or more 
 in announcing the plant delay kellogg chairman william e. <unk> said cereal volume growth in the u.s. has not met our expectations for N 
 he said construction would n't resume until market conditions warrant it 
 kellogg indicated that it has room to grow without adding facilities 
 the company has five other u.s. plants including a modern facility at its battle creek headquarters known as building N which is to add <unk> and <unk> capacity next year 
 general mills meanwhile finds itself <unk> from boosting sales further because its plants are operating at capacity 
 a large plant in <unk> ga. is to come on line next year 
 a kellogg officer who asked not to be named said the memphis project was pulled in for a <unk> of costs an indication that the ambitious plans might be scaled back in any future construction 
 initial cost estimates for the plant which was to have been built in <unk> ranged from $ N billion to $ N billion 
 a company spokesman said it was possible but highly unlikely that the plant might never be built 
 as we regain our leadership level where we have been and as we continue to put new products into the marketplace and need additional capacity we will look at <unk> our involvement with our plan he said 
 the new facility was to have been the world 's most advanced cereal manufacturing plant and kellogg 's largest construction project 
 the company had retained the fluor daniel unit of fluor corp. as general contractor 
 but in recent weeks <unk> sources reported that early preparation work was slowing at the <unk> site 
 <unk> said they were told that equipment orders would be delayed 
 fluor daniel already has <unk> most of its work crew the sources said 
 last friday 's announcement was the first official word that the project was in trouble and that the company 's plans for a surge in market share may have been overly optimistic 
 until recently kellogg had been telling its sales force and wall street that by N it intended to achieve a N N share of market measured in dollar volume 
 although he called current market conditions highly competitive mr. <unk> kellogg 's chairman and chief executive officer forecast an earnings increase for the full year 
 last year the company earned $ N million or $ N a share on sales of $ N billion 
 as expected kellogg reported lower third-quarter earnings

 on friday <unk> <unk> added <unk> to an otherwise <unk> address on malaysia 's proposed budget for N by ordering the kuala lumpur stock exchange to take appropriate action immediately to cut its links with the stock exchange of singapore 
 the <unk> of <unk> companies from the singapore exchange may not be a smooth process analysts say 
 though the split has long been expected the exchanges are n't fully prepared to go their separate ways 
 the finance minister 's order was n't sparked by a single event and does n't indicate a <unk> in relations between the neighboring countries 
 rather the two closely linked exchanges have been <unk> apart for some years with a nearly <unk> <unk> on new dual listings separate and different listing requirements <unk> trading and settlement guidelines and <unk> <unk> aims

 as competition <unk> up in spain 's crowded bank market banco exterior de <unk> is seeking to shed its image of a state-owned bank and move into new activities 
 under the direction of its new chairman francisco luzon spain 's seventh largest bank is <unk> a tough restructuring that analysts say may be the first step toward the bank 's privatization 
 the state-owned industrial holding company <unk> <unk> de <unk> and the bank of spain jointly hold a N N stake in banco exterior 
 the government directly owns N N and <unk> a financial services company holds N N 
 the rest is listed on spanish stock exchanges 
 some analysts are concerned however that banco exterior may have waited too long to diversify from its traditional <unk> activities 
 catching up with commercial competitors in retail banking and financial services they argue will be difficult particularly if market conditions turn sour 
 if that proves true analysts say banco exterior could be a prime partner or even a takeover target for either a spanish or foreign bank seeking to increase its market share after N when the european community plans to <unk> financial barriers 
 with N branches in spain and N banking subsidiaries five branches and N representative offices abroad the banco exterior group has a lot to offer a potential suitor 
 mr. luzon and his team however say they are n't interested in a merger 
 instead they are working to transform banco exterior into an efficient bank by the end of N 
 i want this to be a model of the way a <unk> company should be run mr. luzon says 
 banco exterior was created in N to provide subsidized credits for spanish exports 
 the market for export financing was <unk> in the mid-1980s however forcing the bank to face competition 
 at the same time many of spain 's traditional export markets in latin america and other developing areas faced a sharp decline in economic growth 
 as a result the volume of banco exterior 's export credit portfolio plunged from N billion <unk> $ N billion as of dec. N N to its current N billion pesetas 
 the other two main <unk> of banco exterior 's traditional business wholesale banking and foreign currency trading also began to <unk> under the weight of heavy competition and changing client needs 
 the bank was <unk> in its efforts to face the challenges of a changing market by its links to the government analysts say 
 until mr. luzon took the helm last november banco exterior was run by politicians who lacked either the skills or the will to introduce innovative changes 
 but mr. luzon has moved swiftly to streamline bureaucracy cut costs increase capital and build up new areas of business 
 we 've got a lot to do he acknowledged 
 we 've got to move quickly 
 in mr. luzon 's first year the bank eliminated N jobs 
 now it says it 'll trim another N jobs over the next three to four years 
 the bank employs N people in spain and N abroad 
 to strengthen its capital base banco exterior this year issued $ N million in subordinated debt launched two rights issues and sold stock held in its treasury to small investors 
 the bank is now aggressively marketing retail services at its domestic branches 
 last year 's drop in export credit was partially offset by a N N surge in lending to individuals and small and medium-sized companies 
 though spain has an excess of banks analysts say the country still has one of the most profitable markets in europe which will aid banco exterior with the tough tasks it faces ahead 
 expansion plans also include acquisitions in growing foreign markets 
 the bank says it 's interested in purchasing banks in <unk> portugal and puerto rico 
 but the bank 's retail activities in latin america are likely to be cut back 
 banco exterior was one of the last banks to create a brokerage house before the four spanish stock exchanges <unk> sweeping changes in july 
 the late start may be a <unk> for the bank as spain continues to open up its market to foreign competition 
 but mr. luzon contends that the experienced team he brought with him from banco <unk> <unk> where he was formerly director general will whip the bank 's capital market division into shape by the end of N 
 the bank also says it 'll use its international network to channel investment from london frankfurt zurich and paris into the spanish stock exchanges 
 general motors corp. 's general counsel hopes to cut the number of outside law firms the auto maker uses from about N to N within two years 
 harry j. pearce named general counsel in may N says the reduction is a cost-cutting measure and an effort to let the no. N auto maker 's <unk> in-house legal department take on matters it is better equipped and trained to handle 
 gm trimmed about N firms from its approved local counsel list mr. pearce says 
 the move is consistent with a trend for corporate legal staffs to do more work in-house instead of <unk> it out to law firms 
 mr. pearce set up gm 's first in-house litigation group in may with four lawyers all former assistant u.s. attorneys with extensive trial experience 
 he intends to add to the litigation staff 
 among the types of cases the in-house <unk> handle are disputes involving companies doing business with gm and <unk> actions including one in which a driver is suing gm for damages resulting from an accident 
 mr. pearce has also encouraged his staff to work more closely with gm 's technical staffs to help prevent future litigation 
 gm lawyers have been working with technicians to develop more uniform <unk> procedures the way a vehicle is <unk> has a lot to do with its <unk> 
 the lawyers also monitor suits to identify specific automobile parts that cause the biggest legal problems 
 mr. pearce says law firms with the best chance of retaining or winning business with gm will be those providing the <unk> service at the best cost <unk> similar <unk> from gm 's auto operations to suppliers 
 this does n't necessarily mean larger firms have an advantage mr. pearce said gm works with a number of smaller firms it <unk> highly 
 mr. pearce has shaken up gm 's legal staff by eliminating all titles and establishing several new functions including a <unk> group that has made films on safety and drunk driving 
 federal prosecutors are concluding fewer criminal cases with trials 
 that 's a finding of a new study of the justice department by researchers at <unk> university 
 david burnham one of the authors says fewer trials probably means a growing number of plea bargains 
 in N N N of federal prosecutions concluded at trial in N only N N did 
 the study covered N major u.s. attorneys ' offices including those in manhattan and brooklyn n.y. and new jersey from N to N 
 the justice department rejected the implication that its prosecutors are currently more willing to plea bargain 
 our felony <unk> have been consistent for N years with about N N of all prosecutions going to trial a department spokeswoman said 
 the <unk> is somewhat <unk> in that the <unk> researchers said they based their conclusions on government statistics 
 one possible explanation for this decline in taking cases to trial says mr. burnham is that the number of defendants being charged with crimes by all u.s. attorneys has substantially increased 
 in N the study says prosecutors surveyed filed charges against N defendants for each N people aged N years and older 
 in N prosecutors filed against N defendants for every N adults 
 another finding from the study prosecutors set significantly different priorities 
 the manhattan u.s. attorney 's office stressed criminal cases from N to N averaging N for every N adults 
 but the new jersey u.s. attorney averaged N 
 on the civil side the manhattan prosecutor filed an average of only N cases for every N adults during the same period the san francisco u.s. attorney averaged N 
 the study is to provide reporters academic experts and others raw data on which to base further inquiries

 the prosecutor quoted statements from the <unk> in which they said they were in this country at the invitation of president reagan and that they were enjoying the <unk> of the u.s.

 a federal judge in manhattan threw out the indictment finding that the seven-year delay violated the defendant 's constitutional right to a <unk> trial

 october employment data also could turn out to be the most confusing 
 on the surface the overall unemployment rate is expected to be little changed from september 's N N 
 but the actual head count of <unk> employment payroll jobs is likely to be <unk> by the impact of hurricane hugo strikes and <unk> seasonal adjustments economists said 
 the consensus view calls for an overall job gain of N compared with september 's N increase 
 but the important <unk> segment which last month plunged by N positions and raised recession fears is most likely to be <unk> by the month 's unusual events 
 several other reports come before friday 's jobs data including the september leading indicators index new-home sales and october agricultural prices reports due out tomorrow the october purchasing managers ' index and september construction spending and manufacturers ' orders on wednesday and october <unk> sales on thursday 
 friday brings the final count on october auto sales 
 the employment report is going to be difficult to interpret said michael <unk> economist with <unk> international a unit of mcgraw-hill inc. new york 
 mr. <unk> added that next month 's data is n't likely to be much better because it will be distorted by san francisco 's earthquake 
 what 's more he believes seasonal swings in the auto industry this year are n't <unk> at the same time as in the past because of production and pricing differences that are curbing the <unk> of seasonal adjustments built into the employment data 
 wednesday 's report from the purchasing agents will be watched to see if the index maintains a level below N N as it has for the past couple of months 
 a reading of less than N N indicates an economy that is generally contracting while a reading above N N indicates an economy that 's expanding 
 samuel d. <unk> chief financial economist at kleinwort benson government securities inc. chicago said that the purchasers ' report is valuable because it often presents the first <unk> of economic data for the month 
 but he added some people use the purchasers ' index as a leading indicator some use it as a <unk> indicator 
 but the thing it 's supposed to measure manufacturing strength it missed altogether last month 
 david wyss chief financial economist at data resources inc. boston said that the purchasers ' index does miss occasionally adding when it misses one month it tends to miss the next month too 
 the consensus view on september leading indicators calls for a gain of N N the same as in august 
 economists said greatly increased consumer optimism a larger money supply and higher stock prices helped lift the index 
 all <unk> components such as <unk> orders and building permits are thought to have been weaker 
 data resources ' mr. wyss added that he will be keeping a closer eye than <unk> on october <unk> sales 
 usually october is n't a very interesting month for retail figures because school clothes have been bought and people are waiting for december to buy christmas presents he said 
 but mr. wyss said he will watch the numbers to get an <unk> of whether consumers ' general buying habits may slack off as much as their <unk> apparently has 
 he noted that higher gasoline prices will help <unk> the october totals 
 seasonal factors are also expected to have taken their toll on september new-home sales which are believed to have fallen sharply from august 's N units 
 construction spending is believed to have slipped about N N from august levels although economists noted the rate probably will pick up in the months ahead in response to hurricane and earthquake damage 
 factory owners are buying new machinery at a good rate this fall machine tool makers say but sluggish sales of new cars and trucks raise questions about fourth-quarter demand from the important automotive industry 
 september orders for machine tools rebounded from the summer doldrums but remained N N below year-earlier levels according to figures from <unk> the association for manufacturing technology 
 domestic machine tool plants received $ N million of orders last month up N N from august 's $ N million but still below the $ N million of september N <unk> said 
 machine tools are complex machines ranging from <unk> to <unk> <unk> that are used to shape most metal parts 
 overall demand still is very respectable says christopher c. <unk> group vice president at cincinnati <unk> inc. the nation 's largest machine tool producer 
 the outlook is positive for the intermediate to long term 
 september orders for all u.s. producers in fact were slightly above the monthly average for N a good year for the industry 
 aerospace orders are very good mr. <unk> says 
 and export business is still good 
 while some automotive programs have been delayed they have n't been canceled 
 september was one of the biggest order months in our history says james r. roberts vice president world-wide sales and marketing for <unk> & lewis inc. <unk> du <unk> <unk> 
 at a recent meeting of manufacturing executives everybody i talked with was very positive he says 
 most say they plan to spend more on factory equipment in N than in N 
 but sales of north <unk> <unk> cars are running at an annual rate of only six million down from N million a year earlier 
 and truck sales also are off more than N N 
 auto makers who began deferring some equipment purchases last spring can be expected to remain cautious about spending if their sales do n't pick up machine tool builders say 
 machine tool executives are hopeful however that recent developments in eastern europe will expand markets for <unk> machine tools in that region 
 there is demand for <unk> machine tools in the soviet union and in other eastern european countries as those nations <unk> to improve the efficiency of their ailing factories as well as the quality of their goods 
 however there 's a continuing dispute between machine tool makers and the defense department over whether sophisticated u.s. machine tools would increase the soviet union 's military might 
 the commerce department says go and the defense department says stop complains one machine tool producer 
 if that controversy continues u.s. machine tool makers say west german and other foreign producers are likely to grab most of the sales in eastern europe 
 september orders for <unk> centers <unk> <unk> machines <unk> boring mills and other machines that shape metal by cutting totaled $ N million down N N from $ N million a year earlier but a N N increase from august 's $ N million <unk> said 
 orders last month for <unk> <unk> and other machinery to form metal with pressure surged to $ N million a N N rise from $ N million a year earlier and a N N gain from $ N million in august 
 today 's <unk> are large and costly machines and a few orders can produce a high total for one month that does n't necessarily indicate a trend 
 machine tool shipments last month were $ N million a N N rise from a year earlier and a N N increase from august 
 shipments have run well ahead of N all year as machine tool builders produce against relatively good backlogs 
 u.s. producers had a $ N billion backlog of unfilled orders at the end of september 
 that was up N N from a year earlier even though orders for the first nine months of N were down N N from the comparable N period

 in <unk> stock market circles the <unk> is <unk> 
 at least N companies are coming to the capital market to raise $ N billion an amount never thought possible in india 
 when they talk mega-issues they 're truly talking <unk> says s.a. dave chairman of the securities and exchange board of india 
 the capital market is booming 
 but the mega-issues are raising <unk> about the rapidly <unk> indian capital market 
 one is whether there is enough money to fund the new issues without <unk> stock trading 
 moreover in the relatively <unk> indian stock markets investors frequently do n't know what they are getting when they subscribe to an issue 
 a prospectus in india does n't always tell a potential investor much 
 some of the large amounts are being raised by small firms 
 in addition once money is raised investors usually have no way of knowing how it is spent 
 some analysts are concerned that the mega-issues in such an <unk> environment could lead to a <unk> 
 the rate of failures will be much more than the rate of successes in the <unk> says <unk> patel a former chairman of the giant <unk> mutual fund the unit trust of india 
 they 're going to have <unk> 
 the indian stock markets have been on a five-year high with <unk> and <unk> since prime minister <unk> gandhi started <unk> industry 
 but the last stock market boom in N seems small compared with the current rush to market 
 the $ N billion that some N companies are looking to raise in the year ending march N compares with only $ N billion raised on the capital market in the previous fiscal year 
 in fiscal N before mr. gandhi came to power only $ N million was raised 
 this year 's biggest issue $ N million of convertible debentures by engineering company larsen & toubro ltd. is the largest in indian history 
 and it is n't the only giant issue together the top four issues will raise $ N billion 
 convertible debentures bonds that can later be converted into equity shares are the most popular instrument this year though many companies are also selling <unk> bonds or equity shares 
 these mega-issues are being propelled by two factors economic and political 
 in the past the socialist policies of the government strictly limited the size of new steel mills petrochemical plants car factories and other industrial concerns to <unk> resources and restrict the profits businessmen could make 
 as a result industry operated out of small expensive highly inefficient industrial units 
 when mr. gandhi came to power he <unk> in new rules for business 
 he said industry should build plants on the same scale as those outside india and benefit from economies of scale 
 if the output was too great for the domestic market he said companies should export 
 india 's <unk> businessmen had to be persuaded but they have started to think big 
 some of the projects being funded by the new issues are the first <unk> of mr. gandhi 's policy and they require more capital than the smaller industrial units built in the past 
 the industrial revolution has produced an explosion in the capital market which is a far cheaper source of funds than <unk> banks where interest rates for prime borrowers are around N N 
 the second factor spurring mega-issues is political 
 mr. gandhi has called general elections for november and many businessmen fear that he and his congress i party will lose 
 some companies are raising money in anticipation of a government less predictable than mr. gandhi 's and possibly more restrictive 
 the <unk> <unk> rumor mill also says that some of the money raised in the current spate of issues will be used as campaign donations before the elections 
 no one admits to anything but india 's <unk> have a history of making <unk> campaign donations 
 so far the mega-issues are a hit with investors 
 earlier this year <unk> iron & steel co. 's offer of $ N million of convertible debentures was oversubscribed 
 <unk> <unk> ltd. a marine construction company had similar success with a slightly smaller issue 
 larsen & toubro started accepting applications for its giant issue earlier this month bankers and analysts expect it to be oversubscribed 
 still to come are big issues by <unk> <unk> <unk> ltd. a petrochemical and <unk> company and <unk> <unk> corp india a semiconductor maker 
 while many investors are selling parts of their portfolios to buy the new issues prices on india 's N stock exchanges are holding up so far 
 i do n't think it will lead to any chaos in the secondary market says mr. patel only a sagging tendency 
 says <unk> <unk> chairman of the unit trust of india the markets are headed for growth <unk> of and <unk> before 
 but with growth come growing <unk> and never has this been <unk> on the indian capital market than now 
 in the past the government controlled the markets indirectly through its tight grip on industry itself 
 various ministries decided the products businessmen could produce and how much and government-owned banks controlled the financing of projects and monitored whether companies came through on promised plans 
 the government has been content with this far-reaching <unk> form of control exercised on a <unk> basis with no clear rules or guidelines 
 but now with large amounts being raised from investors the government 's <unk> on regulation and disclosure requirements has a more dangerous aspect 
 the securities and exchange board of india was set up earlier this year along the lines of the u.s. securities and exchange commission but new <unk> has n't pushed the legislation to make it operational 
 mr. dave its head acts <unk> and patient but he makes no <unk> about the need to get to work 
 <unk> or <unk> we feel the prospectus standards need to be considerably improved he says 
 disclosures are very poor in india 
 he says the big questions do you really need this much money to put up these investments have you told investors what is happening in your sector what about your track record are n't asked of companies coming to market 
 instead he says most investors have to rely on the <unk> indian press 
 an example is the biggest offering of them all larsen & toubro 's $ N million bond issue 
 the engineering company was acquired in a takeover earlier this year by the giant reliance textile group 
 although larsen & toubro had n't raised money from the public in N years its new owners frequently raise funds on the local market 
 reliance <unk> a $ N million petrochemical company in N that was at the time the largest public issue in indian history 
 the media has raised questions about larsen & toubro 's issue pointing out that it exceeds the company 's annual sales and its market capitalization 
 even <unk> is the case of <unk> <unk> a semiconductor company with N sales of $ N million that 's raising $ N million to build an iron plant 
 once the money is raised it is n't always certain how it is used 
 larsen & toubro for example says it 's raising $ N million to use as supplier credit on large engineering jobs 
 unlike other companies it has n't <unk> specific projects for the funds 
 and even when specific projects are described in <unk> the money often is used elsewhere according to analysts 
 someone must monitor where the funds are deployed says mr. dave 
 mr. patel agrees there is no proper monitoring and <unk> of the use of these funds 
 they 're trying to plug the various <unk> but they 're totally <unk> for this 
 because of the large amounts of money being raised the loose disclosure requirements and the casual monitoring of how the money is used some analysts fear that there could be a few <unk> which could hurt market confidence far more than the small <unk> that followed the boom of N 
 the government insists that such a possibility is low 
 it says that despite loose regulation of the market itself its longstanding regulation of industry will prevent such crashes

 lion nathan ltd. a new zealand brewing and retail concern said friday that bond corp holdings ltd. is committed to a transaction <unk> lion nathan would acquire N N of bond 's australian brewing assets 
 lion nathan issued a statement saying it is applying to australia 's national companies & securities commission the nation 's corporate <unk> agency for a <unk> to takeover regulations similar to that obtained by s.a. brewing holdings ltd

 s.a. brewing would make a takeover offer for all of bell resources if it exercises the option according to the commission

 finnair finland 's state-owned airline joined the wave of global airline alliances and signed a <unk> cooperation agreement with archrival <unk> airlines system 
 under the accord finnair agreed to coordinate flights marketing and other functions with <unk> the <unk> airline of <unk> norway and sweden 
 the pact also calls for coordination between finnair and switzerland 's national carrier <unk> with which <unk> entered a similar alliance last month 
 finnair and <unk> said they plan to swap stakes in each other 
 neither disclosed details pending board meetings next month 
 officials hinted however that <unk> would take a stake of at least N N in finnair valued at about $ N million at current market prices 
 finnair would receive <unk> shares valued at the same amount officials said 
 general motors corp. and ford motor co. are now going head to head in the markets for shares of jaguar plc as gm got early clearance from the federal trade commission to boost its stake in the british luxury car maker 
 gm confirmed friday that it received permission late thursday from u.s. antitrust regulators to increase its jaguar holdings past the $ N million level 
 ford got a similar <unk> earlier in october and on friday jaguar announced that the no. N u.s. auto maker had raised its stake to N N or N million shares from N N earlier in the week 
 a spokesman for gm the no. N auto maker declined to say how many jaguar shares that company owns 
 in late trading friday jaguar shares <unk> the downward tide in london 's stock market and rose five pence to N pence $ N 
 trading volume was a moderately heavy N million shares 
 in the u.s. jaguar 's american depositary receipts were among the most active issues friday in national over-the-counter trading where they closed at $ N each up N cents 
 analysts expect that the two u.s. auto giants will move quickly to buy up N N stakes in jaguar setting up a potential bidding war for the prestigious jaguar brand 
 british government restrictions prevent any single shareholder from going beyond N N before the end of N without government permission 
 the british government which owned jaguar until N still holds a controlling golden share in the company 
 with the golden share as protection jaguar officials have rebuffed ford 's <unk> and moved instead to forge an alliance with gm 
 jaguar officials have indicated they are close to <unk> up a friendly alliance with gm that would preserve jaguar 's independence but no deal has been announced 
 ford on the other hand has said it 's willing to bid for all of jaguar despite the objections of jaguar chairman sir john <unk> 
 analysts continued to speculate late last week that ford may try to force the issue by calling for a special shareholder 's meeting and urging that the government and jaguar holders remove the barriers to a full bidding contest before december N 
 but a ford spokeswoman in dearborn said friday the company has n't requested such a meeting yet 
 individuals close to the situation believe ford officials will seek a meeting this week with sir john to <unk> their proposal for a full bid 
 any discussions with ford could postpone the <unk> deal headed for completion within the next two weeks 
 the gm agreement is expected to retain jaguar 's independence by involving an eventual N N stake for the u.s. auto giant as well as joint manufacturing and marketing ventures 
 jaguar and gm hope to win jaguar shareholders approval for the accord partly by <unk> it in a way that would n't preclude a full ford bid once the golden share expires 
 there 's either a minority stake package capable of getting jaguar shareholder approval or there is n't said one knowledgeable individual 
 if there is n't the deal wo n't be put forward to shareholders 
 union sentiment also could influence shareholder reaction to a <unk> accord 
 gm 's u.k. unit holds crucial talks today with union officials about its consideration of an <unk> port site for its first major engine plant in britain 
 one <unk> union leader said if they try to build it somewhere else in europe besides the u.k. they are going to be in big trouble with <unk> over any jaguar deal 
 these are the last words abbie hoffman ever <unk> more or less before he killed himself 
 and you are there sort of 
 abbie i 'm ok jack 
 i 'm ok 
 listening <unk> 
 i 'm out of bed 
 i got my feet on the floor 
 <unk> 
 two feet 
 i 'll see you wednesday thursday 
 he <unk> <unk> 
 abbie <unk> i 'll always be with you jack 
 do n't worry 
 abbie lies back and leaves the frame empty 
 of course that was n't the actual conversation the late <unk> activist protest leader and founder of the <unk> ever had with his brother 
 it 's a script <unk> together from interviews by cbs news for a <unk> a dramatic <unk> by an actor of mr. hoffman 's ultimately unsuccessful struggle with depression 
 the segment is soon to be broadcast on the cbs news series saturday night with <unk> chung thus further <unk> the <unk> between <unk> and reality in tv news 
 it is the new journalism come to television 
 ms. chung 's program is just one of several network shows and many more in <unk> that rely on the controversial technique of <unk> events using actors who are supposed to resemble real people living and dead 
 ms. chung 's however is said to be the only network news program in history to employ casting directors 
 abbie hoffman in this case is to be played by hollywood actor paul <unk> who is n't new to the character 
 he was mr. hoffman in a N los angeles production of a play called the chicago conspiracy trial 
 television news of course has always been part <unk> 
 broadcasters have a healthy appreciation of the role entertainment values play in <unk> an audience 
 but as cbs broadcast group president howard <unk> puts it the network now needs to broaden the <unk> of <unk> television and that includes some <unk> 
 since its premiere sept. N the show on which ms. chung appears has used an actor to <unk> the rev. <unk> johns a <unk> leader and one to play a <unk> drug dealer 
 it has <unk> the <unk> of pan am flight N over the scottish town of <unk> 
 on oct. N it did a <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> of associated press <unk> terry anderson who was <unk> in march N and is believed to be held in lebanon 
 the production had actors playing mr. anderson and former <unk> david <unk> the rev. benjamin <unk> and father lawrence <unk> 
 abc news has similarly <unk> out into entertainment <unk> 
 prime time live a new show this season featuring sam donaldson and <unk> <unk> has a studio audience that <unk> and that one night to the embarrassment of the network <unk> at the camera like the crowd on let 's make a deal 
 abc stops short of using an applause sign and a comic to warm up the audience 
 the stars do that themselves 
 nbc news has produced three episodes of an <unk> series produced by <unk> <unk> called yesterday today and tomorrow <unk> maria <unk> chuck <unk> and mary alice williams that also gives work to actors 
 call it a fad 
 or call it the wave of the future 
 nbc 's <unk> are produced by <unk> productions which also makes the successful prime-time nbc entertainment series <unk> <unk> 
 the marriage of news and theater if not exactly inevitable has been <unk> nonetheless 
 news programs particularly if they score well in the ratings appeal to the networks ' <unk> corporate parents because they are so much less expensive to produce than an entertainment show is somewhere between $ N and $ N for a one-hour program 
 entertainment shows tend to cost twice that 
 <unk> have been used successfully for several seasons on such syndicated tabloid tv shows as a current affair which is produced by the fox broadcasting co. unit of rupert murdoch 's news corp 
 that show whose host is ms. chung 's husband <unk> <unk> has a particular <unk> for <unk> <unk> and stories having to do with sex the robert chambers murder case the <unk> lowe tapes what have you 
 gerald stone the executive producer of a current affair says we have opened eyes to being a little less conservative and more <unk> in how to present the news 
 nowhere have eyes been opened wider than at cbs news 
 at N w. <unk> st. in manhattan one floor below the offices of N minutes the most successful prime-time news program ever actors wait in the reception area to <unk> for saturday night with <unk> chung 
 cbs news sends scripts to agents who pass them along to clients 
 the network deals a lot with <unk> including scott <unk> who portrayed mr. anderson and bill <unk> as father <unk> but the network has some big names to contend with too 
 james <unk> jones is cast to play the rev. mr. johns 
 <unk> <unk> may <unk> former california gov. pat brown in a <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> the last man to be executed in california in N 
 saturday night has cast actors to appear in future stories ranging from the abortion rights of <unk> to a nov. N segment on a man named <unk> <unk> who calls himself a monster and is <unk> to be the <unk> prisoner in new york 
 cbs news which as recently as two years ago fired hundreds of its employees in budget cutbacks now <unk> featured actors beginning at $ N a week 
 that is n't much compared with what bill cosby makes or even <unk> chung for that matter who is paid $ N million a year and who recently did a guest shot of her own on the <unk> murphy brown 
 but the money is n't peanuts either particularly for a news program 
 cbs news is also <unk> the N three mile island nuclear accident in <unk> pa. with something less than a cast of thousands 
 it is <unk> the town of N for about N <unk> 
 on oct. N the town 's mayor robert <unk> made an announcement on behalf of cbs during <unk> at the <unk> high school football game asking for <unk> 
 there was a roll of <unk> through the stands says joe <unk> the editor of the weekly press and journal in <unk> 
 they 're <unk> right now at the bank down the street and they want shots of people getting out of cars and kids on <unk> 
 they are approaching everyone on the street and asking if they want to be in a <unk> 
 mr. <unk> says he would n't dream of participating himself 
 no way 
 i think <unk> <unk> 
 though a <unk> may have the flavor hollywood on the hudson it is n't 
 some producers seem tentative about the technique <unk> even 
 so the results while not news are n't exactly theater either at least not good theater 
 and some people do think that acting out scripts is n't worthy of cbs news which once lent prestige to the network and set standards for the industry 
 in his review of saturday night with <unk> chung tom <unk> the tv critic of the washington post and generally an <unk> of cbs wrote that while the show is impressive one has to wonder if this is the proper direction for a network news division to take 
 <unk> events has in general upset news <unk> including former cbs news president richard s. <unk> and former nbc news president <unk> frank former cbs news <unk> walter <unk> and the new dean of the columbia university graduate school of journalism joan <unk> 
 says she once you add <unk> it 's no longer news it 's drama and that has no place on a network news broadcast 
 they should never be on 
 never 
 criticism of the abbie hoffman segment is particularly <unk> among people who knew and loved the man 
 that includes his companion of N years <unk> <unk> as well as his former wife <unk> 
 both women say they also find it <unk> that cbs news is apparently concentrating on mr. hoffman 's problems as a <unk> 
 this is dangerous and <unk> abbie 's life says ms. <unk> who has had an advance look at the <unk> script 
 it 's a <unk> piece about someone who is not here to defend himself 
 mrs. hoffman says that <unk> makes the truth flexible 
 it takes one person 's account and gives it <unk> 
 cbs news interviewed jack hoffman and his sister <unk> as well as mr. hoffman 's <unk> in <unk> township pa 
 also jonathan <unk> who <unk> with mr. hoffman on two books 
 mr. <unk> says i wanted to be interviewed to get abbie 's story out and maybe talking about the illness will do some good 
 the executive producer of saturday night with <unk> chung andrew lack declines to discuss <unk> as a practice or his show in particular 
 i do n't talk about my work he says 
 the president of cbs news david w. burke did n't return numerous telephone calls 
 one person close to the process says it would not be in the best interest of cbs news to comment on a work in progress such as the hoffman <unk> but says cbs news is aware of the concerns of ms. <unk> and mr. hoffman 's former wife 
 neither woman was invited by cbs news to participate in a <unk> discussion about mr. hoffman that is to follow the <unk> 
 mr. <unk> the actor who plays mr. hoffman says he was concerned at first that the script would <unk> an <unk> political mind one that i <unk> but that his concerns were <unk> 
 the producers he says did a good job of <unk> someone who had done so much but who was also a <unk> 
 dentsu inc. the world 's largest advertising agency on the strength of its dominance in the japanese market is setting its sights on overseas expansion 
 last year dentsu started <unk> a joint network with u.s. ad agency young & rubicam and eurocom of france 
 a few months ago dentsu acquired N N of australian agency fortune communication holdings ltd. for N million australian dollars us$ N million 
 dentsu has u.s. subsidiaries but they keep low <unk> 
 now the giant marketing company which holds N N of japan 's N trillion yen $ N billion advertising industry is considering the acquisition of an advertising network in the u.s. or europe 
 what is driving dentsu 's international expansion largely is the need to keep up with its japanese clients as they grow in the u.s. and europe 
 if we do n't do something we wo n't be able to catch up with demand says a dentsu spokesman 
 our president said acquisition is an effective method 
 last year dentsu 's foreign business accounted for less than N N of total billings but the company is aiming at N N in the near future 
 so far it appears cautious about taking the big step 
 for example the spokesman says dentsu has been approached by banks and securities companies a number of times to invest in the troubled british marketing group saatchi & saatchi plc 
 but he said dentsu has n't looked seriously at saatchi 
 though dentsu says it has no concrete acquisition plans or deadlines it is laying the <unk> for international growth 
 it is setting up a special team in charge of international markets and training workers to do business abroad 
 for the year ended march N dentsu sales rose N N to $ N billion from $ N billion and net income jumped N N to $ N million from $ N million 
 dentsu 's billings last year were larger than those of young & rubicam the world 's second-largest ad agency according to a survey by the publication advertising age 
 but success overseas in <unk> markets could be <unk> than for other industries such as manufacturers 
 on its own dentsu 's muscle in japan may count for little in major foreign markets when seeking <unk> clients 
 thus an acquisition may prove the necessary course 
 but japanese agencies are cautious about expanding abroad because client relationships are different 
 japanese agencies do business with rival clients in the same industry a practice that would be <unk> by traditional western conflict rules says roy <unk> the london chief executive of saatchi & saatchi 's communications division 
 although acquiring a foreign company would expand japanese advertising agencies ' business to foreign clients many clients would also be japanese companies expanding overseas says the dentsu spokesman 
 but the different business system would make it hard for dentsu to provide these japanese companies the same kind of services they do in japan

 that introduction comes only two weeks after compaq computer corp. <unk> it had a lead of three to six months on competitors introduced the first u.s. notebook computer with such features 
 despite the inevitable comparison with compaq however texas instruments ' new notebook wo n't be a direct competitor 
 while compaq sells its machines to businesses through computer retailers texas instruments will be selling most of its machines to the industrial market and to <unk> <unk> and <unk> manufacturers

 it stopped selling a standard personal computer a while ago 
 now that is about to change as texas instruments begins marketing two <unk> laptop pcs with N <unk> and N <unk> hard drives 
 the <unk> are not revolutionary and indeed are <unk> in a market first opened by grid systems corp. now a unit of tandy corp. almost two years ago

 the big <unk> is as much of a factor in retailing as in politics he said 
 the christmas quarter is important to retailers because it represents roughly a third of their sales and nearly half of their profits 
 the council 's report is based on data the trade group buys from the u.s. census bureau 
 the information on N metropolitan markets is supplied by retailers such as sears roebuck & co. and k mart corp. as well as closely held concerns such as r.h. macy & co 
 the council plans to release its regional reports monthly

 insurers may see claims resulting from the san francisco earthquake totaling nearly $ N billion far less than the claims they face from hurricane hugo but the recent spate of catastrophes should jolt property insurance rates in coming months 
 the property claims service division of the american insurance services group estimated insured losses from the earthquake at $ N million 
 this estimate does n't include claims under workers ' compensation life health <unk> and liability insurance and damage to infrastructure such as bridges highways and public buildings 
 the estimated earthquake losses are low compared with the $ N billion in claims that insurers face from hurricane hugo which <unk> through the caribbean and the carolinas last month 
 that 's because only about N N of california homes and businesses had earthquake insurance to cover the losses 
 however insurance brokers and executives say that the combination of the bay area earthquake hugo and last week 's explosion at the phillips petroleum co. 's refinery in pasadena texas will cause property insurance and reinsurance rates to jump 
 other insurance rates such as casualty insurance which would cover liability claims are n't likely to firm right away says alice <unk> an industry analyst with <unk> research in avon conn 
 she believes the impact of losses from these catastrophes is n't likely to halt the growth of the industry 's surplus capital next year 
 property reinsurance rates are likely to climb first analysts and brokers believe 
 the reinsurance market has been <unk> by disasters in the u.s. as well as in great britain and europe says thomas <unk> director of research at <unk> lane inc. in atlanta 
 insurers typically retain a small percentage of the risks they underwrite and pass on the rest of the losses 
 insurers buy this insurance protection for themselves by giving up a portion of the premiums they collect on a policy to another firm a reinsurance company which in turn <unk> a portion of any losses resulting from this policy 
 insurers such as cigna corp. <unk> corp and aetna life & casualty co. buy reinsurance from other <unk> companies and lloyd 's of london for one catastrophe at a time 
 after hugo hit many insurers exhausted their reinsurance coverage and had to tap <unk> to replace that coverage in case there were any other major disasters before the end of the year 
 after the earthquake two weeks ago brokers say companies scrambled to replace reinsurance <unk> again and lloyd 's syndicates turned to the london market excess lines for protection of their own 
 james <unk> senior vice president of <unk> & <unk> inc. a new york-based reinsurance broker says insurers who took big losses this fall and had purchased little reinsurance in recent years will be asked to pay some pretty hefty rates if they want to buy reinsurance for N 
 however companies with few catastrophe losses this year and already big buyers of reinsurance are likely to see their rates remain flat or perhaps even decline slightly 
 many companies will be negotiating their N reinsurance contracts in the next few weeks 
 it 's a seller 's market said mr. <unk> of the reinsurance market right now 
 but some large insurers such as state farm mutual automobile insurance co. do n't purchase reinsurance but fund their own program 
 a few years ago state farm the nation 's largest home insurer stopped buying reinsurance because no one carrier could provide all the coverage that it needed and the company found it cheaper to <unk> 
 the $ N million of losses state farm expects from hugo and an additional $ N million from the earthquake are less than N N of state farm 's $ N billion total net worth 
 since few insurers have announced what amount of losses they expect to see from the earthquake it 's impossible to get a clear picture of the quake 's impact on fourth-quarter earnings said herbert <unk> at prudential-bache securities corp 
 <unk> expects an after-tax charge of less than $ N million against fourth-quarter net hartford insurance group a unit of itt corp. expects a $ N million or N cents after-tax charge and fireman 's fund corp. expects a charge of no more than $ N million before taxes and after using its reinsurance

 wilfred american educational corp. said a federal grand jury in boston indicted the operator of <unk> and business schools for mail fraud

 no individuals were charged in the indictment 
 wilfred american said it will vigorously defend itself against the charges and added that the charges <unk> to procedures that it has since changed

 leaseway transportation corp. said it will restructure $ N million of certain subordinated debentures to reduce its debt obligations and interest expense 
 the N N subordinated debentures due N were issued in august N as part of the $ N million financing for a leveraged buy-out of the company 
 leaseway provides transportation services for manufacturers distributors and retailers 
 leaseway said it has begun discussions with certain institutional debt holders to review the proposed private placement transaction which would exchange the debt for new subordinated debt instruments and equity securities 
 specific terms are subject to review and a final agreement with debt holders the company said 
 but the proposed transaction calls for an exchange of the debt for new debentures of lower face value and reduced cash interest 
 also debt holders would be offered an equity position in leaseway which in total would represent a controlling interest in the company 
 drexel burnham lambert inc. is the adviser on the transaction 
 company officials said leaseway <unk> payment requirements of its debt obligations since the leveraged buy-out but our performance since the buy-out makes it <unk> to implement actions that will further improve our cash flow 
 nicaraguan president daniel ortega may have accomplished over the weekend what his u.s. <unk> have failed to do revive a constituency for the contra rebels 
 lawmakers have n't publicly raised the possibility of renewing military aid to the contras and president bush <unk> the question at a news conference here saturday saying only that if there 's an <unk> military offensive that 's going to change the equation N degrees 
 but mr. ortega 's threat over the weekend to end a <unk> cease-fire with the rebels seeking to topple him effectively <unk> the contras as a policy priority just as they were slipping from the <unk> of their most <unk> supporters 
 senate majority leader george mitchell d. maine said yesterday on <unk> 's meet the press that mr. ortega 's threat was a very <unk> move particularly the timing of it 
 the threat came during a two-day celebration in costa rica to highlight central america 's progress toward democracy in the region attended by president bush canadian prime minister brian <unk> and N other western <unk> leaders 
 mr. bush returned to washington saturday night 
 mr. ortega announced on friday that he would end the cease-fire this week in response to the periodic contra <unk> against his army 
 saturday he amended his remarks to say that he would continue to <unk> by the cease-fire if the u.s. ends its financial support for the contras 
 he asked that the remaining u.s. humanitarian aid be diverted to <unk> and <unk> the rebels 
 not only did mr. ortega 's comments come in the midst of what was intended as a <unk> for the region it came as nicaragua is under special international scrutiny in anticipation of its planned february elections 
 outside observers are gathering in nicaragua to monitor the registration and treatment of opposition candidates 
 and important u.s. lawmakers must decide at the end of november if the contras are to receive the rest of the $ N million in so-called humanitarian assistance under a bipartisan agreement reached with the bush administration in march 
 the humanitarian assistance which pays for supplies such as food and clothing for the rebels <unk> along the nicaraguan border with honduras replaced the military aid cut off by congress in february N 
 while few lawmakers anticipated that the humanitarian aid would be cut off next month mr. ortega 's threat practically guarantees that the humanitarian aid will be continued 
 senate minority leader robert dole r. <unk> said yesterday on meet the press i would hope after his mr. ortega 's act yesterday or the day before we 'd have <unk> support for quick action on remaining humanitarian aid 
 sen. dole also said he hoped for <unk> support for a resolution he plans to offer tomorrow <unk> the nicaraguan leader 
 while renewing military aid had been considered out of the question rejected by congress and <unk> by the bush administration mr. ortega 's statement provides contra supporters with the opportunity to press the administration on the issue 
 the administration should now state that if the february election is <unk> by the sandinistas they should call for military aid said former assistant secretary of state elliott abrams 
 in these circumstances i think they 'd win 
 sen. mitchell said that congressional democrats intend to honor the march agreement to give <unk> support to the contras through the february elections although he added that the agreement requires that the contras not <unk> any military action 
 mr. ortega 's threat to breach the cease-fire comes as u.s. officials were acknowledging that the contras have at times violated it themselves 
 secretary of state james baker who accompanied president bush to costa rica told reporters friday i have no reason to deny reports that some contras <unk> some sandinista soldiers 
 mr. baker 's assistant for <unk> affairs bernard <unk> while maintaining that the sandinistas had also broken the cease-fire acknowledged it 's never very clear who starts what 
 he added that the u.s. has cut off aid to some rebel units when it was determined that those units broke the cease-fire 
 in addition to <unk> arguments in favor of ending contra aid mr. ortega 's remarks also played to the <unk> of some u.s. officials and conservatives outside the government that he is searching for ways to manipulate or <unk> the february elections 
 administration officials traveling with president bush in costa rica interpreted mr. ortega 's <unk> as a sign that he is n't responding to the military attacks so much as he is searching for ways to strengthen his hand prior to the elections 
 mr. abrams said that mr. ortega is seeking to <unk> the contras prior to the elections to remove any pressure to hold fair elections 
 my sense is what they have in mind is an excuse for <unk> down on <unk> by creating an atmosphere of a military emergency he said 
 milton petrie chairman of petrie stores corp. said he has agreed to sell his N N stake in deb shops corp. to petrie stores

 <unk> deb shops said it saw little significance in mr. petrie selling his stock to petrie stores 
 we did n't look at it and say oh my god something is going to happen said stanley <unk> vice president and corporate counsel

 the new york mercantile exchange the world 's chief oil futures marketplace is at a critical <unk> 
 several longtime observers of the commodities industry think the fortunes of the merc over the next decade will be determined to a large extent by how well its new natural gas futures contract does and how successful its new president is in raising the level of compliance by floor traders with exchange and commodity futures trading commission rules 
 if the exchange <unk> in these moves they say it might once again fall behind its chief new york competitor the commodity exchange 
 on friday the merc 's board announced that it had approved <unk> pipe line co. 's henry hub in <unk> <unk> as the delivery site for its long-awaited natural gas futures contract 
 it also said that it would start trading the contract as soon as the cftc approved it 
 the cftc has N days to respond to such applications 
 the merc first started working on developing this contract in N 
 only three weeks earlier the merc had turned to one of its own executives 40-year-old r. patrick thompson to replace <unk> t. <unk> as president 
 mr. thompson is believed to have a mandate from the board of directors to help improve the merc 's <unk> reputation as an exchange whose floor traders do n't follow the rules very well 
 ms. <unk> had been forced out in july in a bitter power struggle with <unk> <unk> <unk> chairman and a longtime floor trader on the exchange 
 mr. <unk> told one person familiar with the new york exchanges during the search for a replacement that he was looking for a president who would be responsive to the needs of the membership and the board 
 mr. thompson first came to the exchange in N and has been executive vice president since march N 
 he previously held posts of senior vice president of compliance and senior vice president and general counsel 
 by contrast the comex in july imported a highly regarded outsider arnold f. <unk> as its president 
 mr. <unk> N was a senior officer of the philadelphia stock exchange and is considered a specialist in new financial products 
 mr. thompson is n't <unk> of experience with new products however 
 for the past two years he said he and the exchange 's research department have been working on the new natural gas contract seeking a good delivery site and studying the natural gas market 
 our members are eager to begin trading this contract so we expect no difficulty in attracting <unk> to the natural gas pit he said 
 the educational effort of teaching companies in the natural gas industry how to use the futures to hedge would have to continue for another a year or two he added 
 the merc 's extremely successful contracts in crude oil gasoline and heating oil have made it the largest futures exchange in new york and third behind the chicago board of trade and chicago mercantile exchange 
 in a recent interview mr. thompson said the biggest problem facing all commodity exchanges was one of image 
 earlier this year the u.s. attorney indicted N floor traders and one clerk at the two big chicago exchanges 
 federal authorities in new york started investigating exchanges in may though no <unk> have been handed down there 
 so far they have issued scores of <unk> some of which went to members of the new york merc 
 mr. thompson will have to face some of the consequences of those <unk> 
 in a recent general accounting office study the merc was found to have been the most <unk> in <unk> exchange rules 
 it <unk> the smallest number of <unk> of traders and fines of the four largest commodity exchanges studied over the past five years 
 it also had both the <unk> and least experienced investigators per million contracts traded 
 the merc received considerable criticism in N when it was discovered that its compliance director kevin p. conway who then was responsible for <unk> the exchange 's busy oil and metal pits was engaged in other personal business activities on exchange time including <unk> trips according to a new york merc report prepared last year 
 mr. conway is no longer at the exchange 
 we had a management breakdown in N in terms of compliance mr. thompson says 
 we recognized the problem and took care of it 
 he says that even if the natural gas contract boosts volume at the exchange strongly the N business plan calls for having adequate compliance people to ensure that exchange rules are being followed 
 for years the five new york exchanges have been talking about <unk> in various aspects of their business in order to improve the efficiency of their operations 
 <unk> there has even been talk of mergers between one or more exchanges 
 so far there is little to show for such efforts 
 mr. thompson believes the case for working together is stronger now than ever 
 the cost of competition has become extremely high he says 
 we must find ways to save money for the futures commission merchants who do business on our exchanges 
 he thinks that progress in cooperation can be made in areas where no vested interests have built up 
 one of those areas is the development of a hand-held electronic device that would permit floor traders to enter trades as they make them 
 the <unk> has recommended the creation of a system to record trade data so that an independent <unk> audit trail can be established to prevent customer fraud 
 the merc is now <unk> with the comex in developing such a device to provide such an audit trail 
 the chicago exchanges also are working on such a device 
 another major electronics problem faces mr. thompson the creation of a 24-hour trading system that can be used outside normal trading hours 
 in january the new york merc signed a letter of intent with the chicago merc as a preliminary step to joining their electronic system called <unk> 
 but in may the chicago merc said it was looking into creating a common system with the chicago board of trade and it suspended negotiations with the new york merc 
 mr. thompson says his exchange is n't waiting for the results of the chicago exchanges ' cooperation 
 it recently began a pilot program to test an electronic trading system called <unk> the automated trading system created by the international commodities clearing house 
 looking ahead to commodity markets this week 
 copper 
 michael <unk> metals trader for painewebber inc. in new york said there is good technical support between $ N and $ N a pound for december copper which ended friday at $ N a pound up N cents 
 he views the $ N to $ N range as a buying opportunity and considers the market <unk> 
 i think the market could pop up to the $ N to $ N level without too much difficulty he said 
 but he said it wo n't climb further and he expects it to remain in a trading range between $ N and $ N 
 he noted that the equity markets will set the tone for the industrial metals this week and traders should keep an eye on wall street 
 william <unk> research director for elders futures inc. in new york said for a rally to occur there must be demand from the far east 
 he added that talk of strike settlements at producing mines has been fully discounted 
 however to resume the bull trend according to mr. <unk> copper would have to close over $ N 
 he said there are two reports this week that might affect prices the purchasing managers report on wednesday and the unemployment report on friday 
 precious metals 
 friday 's strong price gains confirmed a turnaround in the precious metals markets according to painewebber 's mr. <unk> 
 most traders will be looking to buy on <unk> he said 
 he thought the moves in the metals last week were most influenced by the uncertainty in the equity and other financial markets 
 according to mr. <unk> floor traders say there is good support for december gold in the $ N to $ N per ounce area around $ N an ounce for december silver and in the $ N to $ N an ounce range for january platinum 
 william <unk> research director for elders futures inc. in new york said the price action for all of last week is the best he has seen on a weekly basis in more than a year 
 he said last week 's activity in gold could <unk> a move to $ N an ounce for the december contract 
 he also said traders should keep an eye on the stock market because if the stock market rallies that could <unk> trouble for the precious metals 
 he said traders should be on the <unk> for how metals producers react to this rally 
 i expect to see some selling but will they kill this one as they have every rally in the recent past by selling and <unk> in prices for their production 
 he noted that for the first time in months there was some light investor interest in the metals 
 grains and soybeans 
 prices this week will likely be dominated by reports on the progress of the corn and soybean harvest as well as by speculation about more purchases of u.s. crops by the soviet union 
 in recent weeks warm and dry weather has <unk> the midwest harvest and that is permitting farmers to rebuild the <unk> that were cut by the N drought 
 if the weather allowed farmers to work in their fields over the weekend many midwest grain elevators will probably sell futures contracts today at the chicago board of trade in order to hedge their weekend purchases from farmers 
 that selling of futures contracts by elevators is what helps keep downward pressure on crop prices during the harvest 
 traders will also watch for whether the soviet union continues its traditional fall buying of u.s. grain 
 so far this month the soviets have bought about N million metric tons of u.s. corn 
 there may be some activity in soybean prices this week as investors try to get rid of the contract for november delivery 
 investors usually do n't want to take physical delivery of a contract <unk> instead to profit from its price swings and then end any obligation to take delivery or make delivery as it <unk> expiration

 the company explained that its main product <unk> <unk> which goes into some advertising materials and white boxes historically does n't have sharp price swings 
 because the stock prices of some paper companies already reflect an expected profit slump painewebber 's mr. ross says he thinks that next year the share prices of some companies may fall at most only N N to N N 
 a company such as federal paper board may be overly discounted and looks <unk> to him he says though he is n't yet recommending the shares 
 wall street is n't avoiding everything connected with paper 
 mr. <unk> recommends <unk> explaining that it is virtually the sole major paper company not <unk> a major capacity expansion and thus should be able to lower long-term debt substantially next year

 mr. kume made the earnings projection for fiscal N ending next march N in an interview with u.s. automotive writers attending the tokyo motor show 
 the executive said that the anticipated earnings increase is fairly modest because nissan is spending heavily to bolster its dealership network in japan and because of <unk> fluctuations

 last year mr. kume said nissan exported slightly over one million vehicles and produced N cars and trucks at its factories in north america europe and australia

 the company said it has agreed to sell the <unk> division for $ N million to <unk> werner co. a closely held firm based in greenville pa

 the municipal bond market is bracing for tough times through the end of the year as it struggles to absorb an <unk> of bonds and two of its best customers turn into sellers 
 commercial banks and property\/casualty insurers which together own about N N of all municipal bonds have been <unk> their securities for weeks 
 last week traders said there were three institutional sellers for every buyer 
 every day we 're getting new bid lists from would-be sellers one trader said 
 most dealers can not continue to absorb this supply 
 as a result yields on long-term <unk> bonds now stand at about N N of long-term treasury yields the highest such level in more than two years 
 there is incredible negative psychology building in the market said <unk> <unk> a vice president at merrill lynch & co 
 people are very concerned about who is going to step up to the plate and buy municipal bonds in the absence of institutional buyers 
 the yield on a group of N revenue bonds compiled by the bond buyer a trade publication now exceeds N N 
 at this week 's new york city bond sale traders expect yields on the 20-year new york bonds to nearly match the N N yield on 30-year treasury bonds 
 for an investor in the N N federal tax <unk> N N tax-free is the same as N N on a taxable investment 
 that 's a <unk> yield nearly three percentage points more than the current yield on 30-year treasury bonds 
 how quickly things change 
 this past summer investors ' appetite for municipal bonds seemed <unk> 
 individuals eager for tax-free income drove up bond prices making state and local government debt one of the <unk> types of fixed-income investments during the period 
 but while analysts say that municipal bonds still offer good value you would n't know it by the way institutional investors are rushing to dump their holdings 
 bond market analysts say the institutional selling was triggered by several factors 
 big banks such as chemical bank and chase manhattan which have been taking heavy charges to expand their third world loan-loss reserves are n't looking for tax-exempt income 
 we do n't need the shelter of tax-free bonds said a spokeswoman at chemical 
 in recent weeks traders said chemical has sold more than $ N billion of tax-free bonds 
 the spokeswoman confirmed that the bank has significantly reduced its <unk> holdings but could n't immediately confirm the amount 
 insurance companies are rushing to sell before the end of the year when some of their tax benefits associated with municipal bonds will be phased out 
 there is speculation that property\/casualty firms will sell even more <unk> as they scramble to raise cash to pay claims related to hurricane hugo and the northern california earthquake 
 fundamental factors are at work as well 
 <unk> bond holders are worried about the impact of a slowing economy on tax revenue at a time when many state and local governments already face budget deficits and huge spending needs 
 the recent natural disasters and the need of many other cities to rebuild crumbling infrastructure suggests that supply of new issues will continue to rise sharply even as demand <unk> off 
 there is just so much going on that it 's difficult to pick just one factor that 's driving the market said ronald ian heller vice president at first chicago capital markets inc. a subsidiary of first chicago corp 
 some of the recent selling could actually be considered a positive sign 
 mutual funds for example are said to be selling existing municipal bonds to raise cash to buy new issues 
 because municipal bonds yields have risen at a time when interest rates generally have fallen some portfolio managers are assuming that bonds bought now will appreciate in value as the municipal bond market <unk> 
 ms. <unk> believes that the mutual funds are selling <unk> bonds that have a negative <unk> those that have <unk> in price slowly relative to the decline in interest rates 
 such bonds she says are those that are <unk> their call date 
 but traders said the market 's tone could pick up this week if new york city 's $ N million bond offering goes well 
 the offering will include $ N million of 20-year tax-exempt bonds and $ N million of taxable bonds 
 a few weeks ago new york sold $ N million of <unk> 
 new york city bonds have been beaten down for three straight weeks 
 on friday some issues fell nearly one point or close to $ N for each $ N face amount 
 the sell-off in new york city bonds was triggered by concerns about the city 's financial health and political uncertainty in view of the impending mayoral election 
 the city 's economy is growing weaker and expenditures are rising as tax revenue is falling 
 the city has issued so much supply recently that some people are getting a little concerned 
 they 'd like to see some other names in their portfolios said michael s. <unk> first vice president at shearson lehman hutton 
 but he thinks investors may be <unk> to the market 's problems 
 overall he says municipal prices are very cheap and represent an excellent buying opportunity 
 friday 's market activity 
 treasury bonds fell sharply on confusion about this week 's treasury debt auction and rumors that a major japanese investor was unloading large amounts of long-term bonds 
 the treasury 's benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of N N down nearly N point from thursday or about $ N for each $ N face amount

 late thursday the treasury said it needed to raise $ N billion quickly and would do so by issuing new securities this week 
 credit market analysts expected the treasury to cancel today 's three-month and six-month sale and to sell $ N billion of cash management bills 
 instead the treasury announced it would sell $ N billion of <unk> cash management bills today and said that the weekly sale of $ N billion of three-month and six-month bills will take place today as usual but the sale will settle tomorrow instead of thursday 
 by moving the settlement date ahead the treasury can raise money under the $ N trillion debt ceiling that is in effect through tomorrow after which it <unk> to $ N trillion 
 the market also was hurt by rumors that nippon kangyo <unk> a japanese brokerage firm was unloading some of the 30-year bonds it recently purchased 
 one dealer said the talk was that the firm sold about $ N million of bellwether 30-year bonds 
 the firm is thought to have purchased up to $ N billion of 30-year bonds in a buying spree on wednesday and the previous thursday 
 dealers say the firm apparently has wanted to <unk> its recent buying and subsequent selling of 30-year bonds by using <unk> <unk> securities corp. as a broker 
 <unk> provides price quotes to telerate systems inc. a widely used electronic system 
 nippon kangyo 's moves <unk> traders and created confusion among potential investors many of whom decided to stay out of the market 
 as a result of its large-scale buying some analysts now say that liquidity or the ability to easily buy and sell has been <unk> in the benchmark treasury bond issue 
 in other markets 
 the junk bonds of rjr nabisco inc. rallied friday on news that the company is selling its candy bar brands to nestle foods corp. for $ N million

 twice in two weeks the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> ual buy-out <unk> the stock market 
 now stock prices seem to be in a general retreat 
 since <unk> at N on oct. N the dow jones industrial average has lost N points or N N closing friday at N down N 
 the number of issues falling on the new york stock exchange each day is <unk> the number of gainers 
 and the number of stocks hitting new lows far <unk> the number setting new highs 
 but why should an <unk> $ N billion leveraged buy-out deal shake the foundations of the entire stock market 
 opinions vary about how important the ual deal was to the market 's health but analysts generally agree that the market gyrations created as the ual plan <unk> revealed a fundamental change in investor psychology 
 if this had happened a few months ago when the atmosphere was still very positive it would n't have been greeted with anything like the impact it has had over the past two weeks says dennis <unk> a market strategist at kidder peabody 
 there are of course analysts who view the <unk> that briefly <unk> through investors on oct. N and again on oct. N as <unk> <unk> of good judgment that have only temporarily undermined a healthy stock market 
 sure price action is volatile and that 's scary but <unk> stocks are still a good place to be they suggest 
 the reaction to the ual debacle is <unk> says john connolly chief market strategist at dean witter 
 ual is a small deal as far as the overall market is concerned 
 the only way you can make it a big deal is to draw <unk> that just do n't make sense 
 he suggests for example that investors may have assumed that just because ual could n't get financing no leveraged buy-outs can get financing 
 carried even further some investors assumed that since leveraged buy-outs are the only thing <unk> up stock prices the market would collapse if no more lbos could be done 
 there will still be deals argues mr. connolly 
 there may not be as many and the buyers may not get away with some of the things they 've done in the past but deals wo n't disappear 
 he forecasts that the emphasis in mergers and acquisitions may soon return to what he calls strategic deals in which somebody is taking over a company not to milk the cash flow but because it 's a good fit 
 and even without deals mr. connolly figures the market would remain healthy 
 he notes for instance that there has n't been a merger or acquisition among the N stocks in the dow jones industrial average since N yet that average only three weeks ago hit a record high 
 those stocks are up because their earnings are up and their dividends are up he says 
 even the volatility created by stock index arbitrage and other computer-driven trading strategies is n't entirely bad in mr. connolly 's view 
 for the long-term investor who picks stocks carefully the price volatility can provide welcome buying opportunities as short-term players scramble <unk> to sell stocks in a matter of minutes 
 who can make the better decision the guy who has N seconds to decide what to do or the guy with all the time in the world he says 
 what on earth does the ual deal have to do with the price of <unk> which i was able to buy on oct. N at a very attractive price 
 kidder peabody 's mr. <unk> also sees some benefits to the stock market 's recent drop 
 we 've run into a market that was beginning to run out of steam and get <unk> he says 
 the balloon had been <unk> up so big that when somebody came along with a <unk> in this case the ual deal we got a little pop 
 the pop <unk> up investors who had been getting a little too <unk> says mr. <unk> 
 it provided an excuse for people to get back to reality and to look at the economic data especially the third-quarter economic numbers and to realize that we ca n't continue to <unk> over what is going on in the junk bond market 
 but he figures that at current levels the stock market is <unk> valued even with the economy obviously slowing 
 just because we 've got some <unk> back in the market does n't mean it 's going lower from here he says 
 the bottom line is that it 's healthy to have this kind of <unk> activity especially after a N N gain in stock values over the past N months 
 he 's now estimating that after a period of consolidation the dow jones industrial average will once again forge new highs 
 maybe maybe not 
 <unk> joseph cohen a market strategist at drexel burnham lambert is n't nearly so <unk> about the market 's chances of surging to new highs anytime soon 
 her view is that stock prices have three major <unk> merger and buy-out proposals earnings and the economic outlook 
 at current levels of economic activity and earnings stocks are fairly valued she says 
 but any chance for prices to surge above fair value lies in the speculation that <unk> a vigorous merger and buy-out business and ual has obviously put a <unk> on that 
 stocks are n't cheap anymore there have been some judicial and legislative changes in the merger area and all of this changes the <unk> of deals she says 
 i 'm not saying they 've stopped altogether but future deals are going to be structured differently and bids probably wo n't be as high 
 but that 's not the only problem for stocks 
 the other two <unk> earnings and the economic outlook are troubling too 
 <unk> is getting all the <unk> right now but these other things have been building up more gradually she says 
 third-quarter earnings have been generally disappointing and with economic data showing a clear slowing the outlook for earnings in the fourth quarter and all of N is getting worse 
 there are a lot more downward than upward revisions and it looks like people are questioning corporate profits as a means of support for stock prices she says 
 with all this can stock prices hold their own 
 the question is <unk> at this point she says 
 it depends on what happens 
 if the economy <unk> into a recession then this is n't a level that 's going to hold

 federal investigators have identified the problem in last july 's crash of a united airlines flight in iowa a structural flaw that developed during the making of a titanium engine disk 
 for several months officials at the federal aviation administration and the national transportation safety board have suspected that a <unk> flaw in the disk led to a crack that ultimately caused the <unk> engine to break apart in flight 
 the explosion sent <unk> of metal flying <unk> the <unk> 's <unk> or control systems and led to the crash that killed N people 
 but investigators could confirm their theory only after the recent <unk> of a big chunk of flight N 's <unk> engine from a <unk> near the <unk> city airport in iowa 
 the safety board will begin four days of hearings on the accident tomorrow in <unk> city 
 among the issues the board will examine is whether united airlines a unit of ual corp. should have been able to detect the cracks through maintenance checks 
 the engine involved was a <unk> made by general electric co 
 anthony broderick the faa 's acting executive director for regulatory standards and compliance said that recent tests of the failed engine disk indicate that a flaw known as hard <unk> occurred in the titanium during its production almost N years ago 
 he said there was n't any way to detect the flaw at that time and that the process has since been changed to decrease the chance that such flaws would occur 
 the faa already has ordered that all N disks made by the old process be removed from the planes and <unk> to an <unk> test in a <unk> chamber 
 such tests make the faa confident that a <unk> <unk> accident wo n't happen again said mr. broderick 
 a spokesman for ge said that the company has been working with the faa all along on this issue and will comply fully with the required <unk> 
 but he also pointed out that the recalls will have no impact on ge 's engine production

 researchers at ohio state university and <unk> institute of <unk> and <unk> in china have <unk> samples of <unk> ice in <unk> and say temperatures there have been significantly higher on average over the past <unk> than in any similar period in the past N years 
 the ice samples are an important piece of evidence supporting theories that the earth has <unk> considerably in recent times largely because of <unk> in the air and will warm far more in the century ahead 
 a substantial warming would <unk> some of the earth 's <unk> ice <unk> raising the level of the <unk> and causing widespread flooding of heavily <unk> coastal areas 
 if you can use data to <unk> what happened in the past you have much more confidence in predictions for the future said <unk> thompson a research scientist at ohio state who <unk> for and <unk> the ice samples 
 to compare temperatures over the past N years researchers <unk> the changes in <unk> of two forms of <unk> 
 these measurements can indicate <unk> changes researchers said because the rates of <unk> of these <unk> atoms differ as temperatures change 
 analysis of ice from the <unk> ice cap a <unk> <unk> in <unk> N feet above sea level show that average temperatures were higher in N than in any other <unk> period since before the last ice age mr. thompson said 
 some climate models project that interior regions of asia would be among the first to heat up in a global warming because they are far from <unk> which moderate <unk> changes 
 but the <unk> samples are n't definitive proof that the so-called greenhouse effect will lead to further substantial global heating mr. thompson acknowledged 
 according to greenhouse theories increased carbon dioxide emissions largely caused by burning of fossil fuels will cause the earth to warm up because carbon dioxide prevents heat from <unk> into space 
 skeptics say that if that 's the case temperatures should have risen fairly <unk> over the past century reflecting the increase in carbon dioxide 
 instead the <unk> <unk> record shows increasing temperatures from N through the early 1950s <unk> temperatures from the late 1950s through the mid-1970s then higher temperatures again through last year 
 other <unk> data show similar <unk> swings 
 climate <unk> drastically due to natural causes said mr. thompson 
 but he said ice samples from peru <unk> and <unk> all show substantial signs of warming

 congress sent to president bush an $ N billion military construction bill that cuts spending for new installations by N N while revamping the pentagon budget to move more than $ N million from foreign bases to <unk> projects 
 the fiscal N measure builds on a pattern set earlier this year by house and senate defense <unk> committees and at a time of <unk> for the military and concern about the u.s. 's standing in the world economy overseas spending is most vulnerable 
 total pentagon requests for installations in west germany japan south korea the united kingdom and the philippines for example are cut by almost two-thirds while lawmakers added to the military budget for construction in all but a dozen states at home 
 the result is that instead of the pentagon 's proposed split of N between domestic and foreign bases the reduced funding is distributed by a ratio of approximately N 
 the extra margin for bases in the u.s. <unk> the power of the appropriations committees meanwhile lawmakers used their positions to <unk> as much as six times what the pentagon had requested for their individual states 
 house appropriations committee chairman jamie whitten d. miss helped secure $ N million for his state or more than double the pentagon 's budget 
 west virginia home of senate appropriations committee chairman robert byrd would receive $ N million four times the military 's request 
 tennessee and north carolina home states of the two democratic chairmen of the house and senate military construction <unk> receive $ N million or N N above the pentagon 's request 
 though spending for iowa and oregon was far less their increases above pentagon requests N N and N N respectively were much greater because of the influence of republicans at critical <unk> 
 the swift passage of the bill which cleared the senate and house on simple voice votes last week contrasts with the problems still facing a more <unk> $ N billion measure funding housing environmental space and veterans programs 
 by an N margin the senate approved the bulk of the spending friday but the bill was then sent back to the house to resolve the question of how to address budget limits on credit <unk> for the federal housing administration 
 the house democratic leadership could seek to waive these restrictions but the underlying bill is already under attack for excesses elsewhere 
 appropriations committees have used an <unk> of devices to <unk> as much as $ N billion in spending and as critics have <unk> to these devices the bill can seem like a <unk> <unk> trying to make it past ice and <unk> to reach safer winter <unk> 
 much of the excess spending will be pushed into fiscal N and in some cases is temporarily <unk> in <unk> accounts in anticipation of being transferred to <unk> areas after the budget <unk> is completed 
 for example a house-senate conference <unk> increased the national aeronautics and space administration budget for construction of facilities to nearly $ N million or more than $ N million above what either chamber had previously approved 
 part of the increase would provide $ N million toward ensuring construction of a costly solid <unk> facility in mr. whitten 's mississippi 
 but as much as $ N million or nearly N N of the account is marked for potential transfers to research management and flight accounts that are spent out at a faster <unk> 
 the bill 's managers face criticism too for the unusual number of conditions openly imposed on where funds will be spent 
 conservatives embarrassed by republican <unk> scandals at the department of housing and urban development have used the issue in an effort to shift blame onto a <unk> congress 
 hud secretary jack kemp backed an unsuccessful effort to strike such language last week but received little support from the white house budget office which wants to protect <unk> funding in the bill and has <unk> to turn its eyes from pork-barrel amendments

 mobil corp. is in the midst of cutting back its exploration and production group which finds and develops oil and gas reserves in the u.s. by as much as N N as part of a new restructuring of that sector of its business 
 management advised employees friday that it was going to reduce employment in production operations of the group by N N or N people 
 the exploration side of the unit has recently <unk> a similar overhaul during which it also lost as many as N employees a company spokesman said in response to questions 
 mobil exploration & producing u.s. inc. the group involved currently has a work force of somewhat less than N 
 a few years ago mobil restructured the entire company during an industrywide <unk> 
 but since then u.s. oil production has declined and mobil wants to focus its <unk> efforts overseas 
 mobil <unk> to the <unk> cuts last week when it took a $ N million charge as part of its third-quarter earnings and attributed it to a restructuring 
 mobil officials said that it is unlikely any additional charges related to this move will be taken in future quarters 
 on wednesday mobil will begin offering separation packages and voluntary retirement in its u.s. production operation 
 mobil officials said they have been studying ways of streamlining these operations since early this year 
 during the coming months <unk> of management will be <unk> away and regional offices will become more <unk> 
 for greater efficiency employees at those locations will be <unk> into teams responsible for managing the properties under their jurisdiction mobil said 
 the main feature of the new organization is that each local manager will have both the authority and accountability for profitable and technically sound operations said charles e. <unk> president of the mobil unit 
 field offices at new orleans houston denver midland <unk> <unk> calif. oklahoma city and liberal kan. will be maintained 
 but the staffs at some of those locations will be slashed while at others the work force will be increased 
 for instance employment in denver will be reduced to N from N 
 but on the west coast where profitable oil production is more likely than in the <unk> region the <unk> calif. office staff of N will grow by N to N 
 the reorganization will focus on the value and potential of assets mr. <unk> said 
 wanted an investment that 's as simple and secure as a certificate of deposit but offers a return worth getting excited about 
 with $ N billion of cds maturing this month a lot of people have been <unk> the financial landscape for just such an investment 
 in april when many of them bought their cds six-month certificates were yielding more than N N investors willing to look could find double-digit yields at some banks and thrifts 
 now the nationwide average yield on a six-month cd is just under N N and N N is about the best around 
 but investors looking for alternatives are n't finding it easy 
 yields on most fixed-income securities are lower than several months ago 
 and the stock market 's recent gyrations are a painful reminder of the dangers there 
 if you 're looking for a significantly higher yield with the same level of risk as a cd you 're not going to find it says washington financial planner dennis m. <unk> 
 there are however some alternatives that <unk> investors should consider investment advisers say 
 short-term municipal bonds bond funds and <unk> annuities are some of the choices they mention and not just as a way to get a higher return 
 in particular advisers say investors may want to look at securities that reduce the risk that cd holders are <unk> right now of having to reinvest the proceeds of maturing short-term certificates at lower rates 
 a mix of cds and other holdings may make the most sense 
 people should remember their money is n't all or nothing they do n't need to be shopping for the one <unk> investment and putting all their money in it says <unk> md. adviser karen schaeffer 
 here 's a look at some of the alternatives 
 short-term municipals 
 investors with a heavy tax load should take out their <unk> 
 yields on municipal bonds can be higher than after-tax yields on cds for maturities of perhaps one to five years 
 that 's because <unk> interest is exempt from federal income tax and from state and local taxes too for <unk> investors 
 for an investor paying tax at a N N rate a seemingly <unk> N N yield on a one-year <unk> is equivalent to a taxable N N 
 rates approach N N on five-year municipals 
 some of the more cautious cd holders might like <unk> municipals 
 these securities get top credit ratings because the issuers have put aside u.s. bonds that will be sold to pay off holders when the municipals are retired 
 it 's a <unk> you do n't have to worry about diversification you do n't have to worry about quality says steven j. <unk> executive vice president of the new york bond firm of <unk> <unk> & <unk> inc 
 consider a <unk> bond portfolio with issues maturing in say N N and N advises malcolm a. <unk> a <unk> r.i. financial planner 
 the idea is to have money rolling over each year at prevailing interest rates 
 bond funds 
 bond mutual funds offer diversification and are easy to buy and sell 
 that makes them a reasonable option for investors who will accept some risk of price <unk> in order to make a bet that interest rates will decline over the next year or so 
 buyers can look forward to double-digit annual returns if they are right 
 but they will have disappointing returns or even losses if interest rates rise instead 
 bond resale prices and thus fund share prices move in the opposite direction from rates 
 the price movements get bigger as the maturity of the securities <unk> 
 consider for instance two bond funds from vanguard group of investment cos. that were both yielding N N on a recent day 
 the short term bond fund with an average maturity of N N years would deliver a total return for one year of about N N if rates drop one percentage point and a one-year return of about N N if rates rise by the same amount 
 but in the same circumstances the returns would be a more extreme N N and N N for the vanguard bond market fund with its N 1\/2-year average maturity 
 you get <unk> returns from bonds if you guess right on rates says james e. wilson a columbia s.c. planner 
 if interest rates do n't change bond fund investors ' returns will be about equal to the funds ' current yields 
 deferred annuities 
 these insurance company contracts feature some of the same tax benefits and restrictions as <unk> individual retirement accounts investment gains are compounded without tax consequences until money is withdrawn but a N N penalty tax is imposed on withdrawals made before age N N 
 aimed specifically at cd holders are so-called <unk> annuities or certificates of annuity 
 an interest rate is guaranteed for between one and seven years after which holders get N days to choose another guarantee period or to switch to another insurer 's contract without the surrender charges that are common to annuities 
 some current rates exceed those on cds 
 for instance a <unk> annuity from north american co. for life & health insurance chicago offers N N interest for one year or a N N rate for two years 
 annuities are rarely a good idea at age N because of the withdrawal restrictions 
 but at age N they may be a great deal says mr. wilson the columbia s.c. planner 
 money market funds 
 that 's right money market mutual funds 
 the conventional wisdom is to go into money funds when rates are rising and shift out at times such as the present when rates seem headed down 
 with average maturities of a month or so money funds offer fixed share prices and floating returns that track market interest rates with a slight lag 
 still today 's <unk> money funds may beat cds over the next year even if rates fall says guy <unk> an editor of the bond market <unk> newsletter in atlanta 
 that 's because <unk> funds currently offer yields almost N N percentage points above the average cd yield 
 mr. <unk> likes the dreyfus worldwide dollar money market fund with a seven-day compound yield just under N N 
 a new fund its operating expenses are being temporarily subsidized by the sponsor 
 try combining a money fund and an <unk> bond fund as a <unk> bet on falling rates suggests back bay <unk> inc. a mutual fund unit of new england insurance co 
 if rates unexpectedly rise the increasing return on the money fund will partly offset the lower-than-expected return from the bond fund 
 federal drug regulators concerned over british reports that diabetics have died after shifting from animal to <unk> insulin say they are considering a study to see if similar deaths have occurred here 
 the united kingdom reports came from dr. patrick toseland head of clinical chemistry at guy 's hospital in london 
 in a telephone interview friday dr. toseland said the number of sudden <unk> deaths of diabetics he had seen this year was N compared with just two in N 
 at least six of the deaths occurred among relatively young diabetics who had switched from animal to human insulin within the past year he said 
 dr. <unk> <unk> director of <unk> and <unk> drug products for the u.s. food and drug administration said fda officials have discussed dr. toseland 's findings fairly <unk> 
 while there have been no reports of similar sudden <unk> deaths among diabetics in the u.s. dr. <unk> said the fda plans to examine dr. toseland 's evidence and is considering its own study here 
 dr. toseland a <unk> said he was preparing an article for a british <unk> medical journal raising the possibility that the deaths may have occurred after human insulin <unk> critical warning signs indicating hypoglycemia or low blood sugar which can kill diabetics 
 the usual warning signs of hypoglycemia include <unk> anxiety and <unk> 
 with proper warning diabetics can easily raise their blood sugar to safe levels by eating sugar or <unk> food 
 the <unk> data certainly shows that some of the people were not aware of the rapid <unk> of hypoglycemia dr. toseland said 
 at the u.s. national institutes of health dr. robert e. <unk> chief of the <unk> program branch said no evidence of unexpected deaths from hypoglycemia had shown up in a study of N diabetics that has been under way at nih for five years 
 however he said officials conducting the study had n't been looking for signs of problems related to hypoglycemia <unk> 
 we are now monitoring for it much more closely he said 
 we do know there are slight differences in the way human and animal <unk> drive down blood sugar dr. <unk> said 
 the <unk> drug starts the blood sugar dropping sooner and drives it down faster he said 
 but we do n't believe there is enough of a difference to be <unk> significant dr. <unk> said 
 reports of dr. toseland 's findings in the british press have triggered widespread concern among diabetics there 
 both the british <unk> association and the committee on safety in <unk> britain 's equivalent of the u.s. fda recently issued statements noting the lack of hard scientific evidence to support dr. toseland 's findings 
 on friday the american <unk> association issued a similar statement urging the six million u.s. diabetics not to <unk> to the british report 
 a loss of the warning symptoms of hypoglycemia is a complex problem that is very unlikely to be due simply to the type of insulin used the american association said 
 the fda already requires drug manufacturers to include warnings with insulin products that symptoms of hypoglycemia are less <unk> with human insulin than with <unk> products 
 eli lilly & co. the <unk> drug manufacturer dominates the u.s. human insulin market with its product known as <unk> 
 lilly is building plants to make the insulin in indianapolis and <unk> france 
 in its latest annual report lilly said <unk> sales have shown excellent growth 
 lilly officials said they had seen reports of <unk> <unk> among some patients making the shift from animal to human insulin but did n't know if the problem had caused any deaths 
 dr. <unk> thompson a lilly group vice president said the company 's clinical trials of both its animal and <unk> <unk> indicated no difference in the level of hypoglycemia between users of either product 
 dr. toseland said most of the british diabetics who died had been taking a <unk> insulin made by <unk> a <unk> manufacturer 
 none of the diabetics were using lilly 's insulin 
 <unk> corp. said it will reduce its <unk> work force by about N N effective tomorrow in an effort to stem continuing losses 
 the company which makes data base systems and software said it expects to report a loss for the third quarter ended sept. N 
 defense intellectuals have complained for years that the pentagon can not determine priorities because it has no strategy 
 last april the new defense secretary richard cheney acknowledged that given an ideal world we 'd have a nice neat orderly process 
 we 'd do the strategy and then we 'd come around and do the budget 
 this city does n't work that way 
 with a five-year defense plan costing more than $ N trillion it 's about time we put together a defense strategy that works in washington 
 this wo n't happen until strategists come down from their ivory tower and learn to work in the real world of limited budgets and uncertain futures 
 as it is we identify national goals and the threats to these goals we shape a strategy to counter these threats we determine the forces needed to execute the strategy before finally <unk> the budgets needed to build and maintain the forces 
 these procedures consume millions of <unk> of labor and produce tons of paper and each year their end product the five year defense plan promptly <unk> away 
 the <unk> on the left shows how this happens see accompanying illustration wsj oct. N N 
 compare the past eight five-year plans with actual appropriations 
 the pentagon 's strategists produce budgets that simply can not be executed because they assume a defense strategy depends only on goals and threats 
 strategy however is about possibilities not hopes and dreams 
 by ignoring costs u.s. strategists <unk> their responsibility for hard decisions 
 that puts the real strategic decisions in the hands of others <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> 
 these people have different <unk> 
 and as a result as the recent vote by the house to undo mr. cheney 's program <unk> suggests the <unk> of jobs is becoming the real goal of defense strategy 
 how can we turn this situation around 
 reform starts in the pentagon 
 strategists should consider the impact of budget uncertainties at the beginning of the planning process 
 they ought to examine how a range of optimistic to pessimistic budget scenarios would change the defense program 
 they would then develop priorities by identifying the least painful program cuts as they moved from higher to lower budgets 
 they would also identify the best way to add programs should the budget come in at higher levels 
 this kind of <unk> analysis is common in war planning and business planning 
 there is no reason that it can not be done for defense planning 
 two steps are necessary to translate this idea into action 
 step N <unk> up our books 
 our five-year plan contains three accounting devices negative money an above <unk> management reserve and optimistic inflation estimates which <unk> the spending the pentagon has committed itself to by almost $ N billion 
 negative money was invented in N to make the N five year defense plan conform to the numbers in president reagan 's final budget <unk> to congress 
 that plan exceeded the numbers contained in his budget message by $ N billion 
 to make the books balance as is required by law somebody invented a new budget line item that simply <unk> $ N billion 
 it is known in the pentagon as the negative wedge 
 the pentagon argues that the negative wedge is the net effect of $ N billion in the <unk> unidentified procurement reductions that it intends to find in future years and $ N billion in an above <unk> management reserve that accounts for <unk> programs that will <unk> in the future 
 the N plan also assumes inflation will decline to N N by N 
 most <unk> including those in the congressional budget office assume inflation will be in excess of N N in each of those five years 
 at that rate the defense plan is <unk> by $ N billion 
 by adding the negative wedge and <unk> the remaining program using a more probable inflation estimate we arrive at a baseline program costing $ N trillion between N and N 
 step N <unk> how four <unk> lower budget scenarios would change the baseline and how these changes would affect our national security 
 the <unk> on the right which assumes a N N rate of inflation places these scenarios in the context of recent appropriations see accompanying illustration wsj oct. N N 
 note how the baseline program assumes a sharp increase in future appropriations 
 step N will answer the question what happens if these increases do not <unk> 
 scenario N known as the constant dollar freeze <unk> the pentagon for inflation only it <unk> upward at N N per year 
 this scenario has been the rough position of the u.s. senate since N and it reduces the baseline by $ N billion between N and N 
 scenario N the current dollar freeze has been the <unk> position of the house of representatives for about four years 
 it <unk> the budget at its current level and forces the pentagon to eat the effects of inflation until N 
 this reduces the baseline by $ N billion 
 scenario N <unk> the recent <unk> between the house and the senate it <unk> the difference between scenarios N and N by increasing the budget at N N per year 
 it reduces the baseline by $ N billion 
 finally scenario N reduces the budget by N N per year for the next five years a total reduction of $ N billion 
 this can be thought of as a pessimistic prediction perhaps driven by the <unk> effects of the gramm-rudman deficit reduction law or possibly a <unk> of <unk> with the soviet union 
 the strategic planners in the joint chiefs of staff would construct the most effective defense program for each scenario <unk> strengths and <unk> weaknesses 
 they would conclude their efforts by producing a comprehensive net assessment for each plan including the assumptions made an analysis of its deficiencies and limitations the impact on national security and the best strategy for working around these limitations 
 this exercise would reveal the true cost of a particular program by forcing the strategists to make hard decisions 
 if for example they choose to keep the b-2 <unk> bomber they would have to sacrifice more and more other programs such as carrier <unk> or army divisions as they moved toward lower budget levels 
 these <unk> would <unk> priorities by <unk> when the cost of the b-2 became <unk> 
 some may be <unk> to argue that the idea of a strategic review merely <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> concept of the carter administration 
 but <unk> did not involve the strategic planners in the joint chiefs of staff and therefore <unk> into a <unk> drill driven by budget politics 
 anyway <unk> 's procedures were so <unk> that everyone involved was crushed under a burden of <unk> 
 a strategic review is fundamentally different 
 it would be run by the joint chiefs under simple <unk> produce the best possible force for each budget scenario and provide the secretary of defense with a comprehensive net assessment of how that force could be used to achieve u.s. goals 
 it might be feared that even thinking about lower budgets will hurt national security because the door will be opened to <unk> budget cutting by an irresponsible congress 
 this argument plays well in the atmosphere of <unk> and <unk> <unk> the pentagon and congress and unfortunately there is some truth to it 
 but in the end it must be rejected for logical as well as moral reasons 
 to say that the pentagon should act <unk> because acting <unk> will <unk> congress into acting <unk> leads to the conclusion that the pentagon should deliberately <unk> its needs in the national interest in other words that it is justified in committing a crime lying to congress because it is morally superior 
 strategy is not a game between the pentagon and congress it is the art of the possible in a world where constraints force us to choose between <unk> or <unk> alternatives 
 if we want meaningful priorities we must understand the <unk> they <unk> before we make commitments 
 strategy is not a separate event in an <unk> <unk> of <unk> events it is a way of thinking that <unk> threats to our interests in a manner consistent with our financial cultural and physical limitations

 although bullish dollar sentiment has <unk> many currency analysts say a massive sell-off probably wo n't occur in the near future 
 while wall street 's tough times and lower u.s. interest rates continue to undermine the dollar weakness in the pound and the yen is expected to offset those factors 
 by default the dollar probably will be able to hold up pretty well in coming days says <unk> <unk> a foreign-exchange adviser at credit suisse 
 we 're close to the bottom of the near-term ranges she contends 
 in late friday afternoon new york trading the dollar was at N marks and N yen off from late thursday 's N marks and N yen 
 the pound strengthened to $ N from $ N 
 in tokyo monday the u.s. currency opened for trading at N yen down from friday 's tokyo close of N yen 
 the dollar began friday on a firm note gaining against all major currencies in tokyo dealings and early european trading despite reports that the bank of japan was seen unloading dollars around N yen 
 the rise came as traders continued to dump the pound after the sudden resignation thursday of british chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson 
 but once the pound <unk> with help from purchases by the bank of england and the federal reserve bank of new york the dollar was dragged down traders say by the stock-market slump that left the dow jones industrial average with a loss of N points 
 with the stock market <unk> and dollar buyers discouraged by signs of u.s. economic weakness and the recent decline in u.s. interest rates that has diminished the <unk> of dollar-denominated investments traders say the dollar is still in a <unk> position 
 they 'll be looking at levels to sell the dollar says james <unk> a foreign-exchange marketing representative at bank of montreal 
 while some analysts say the dollar eventually could test support at N marks and N yen mr. <unk> and others do n't see the currency <unk> sliding under support at N marks and N yen soon 
 predictions for limited dollar losses are based largely on the pound 's weak state after mr. lawson 's resignation and the yen 's inability to strengthen substantially when there are dollar <unk> 
 with the pound and the yen lagging behind other major currencies you do n't have a confirmation that a sharp dollar downturn is in the works says mike <unk> senior currency analyst at <unk> inc. in chicago 
 as far as the pound goes some traders say a slide toward support at $ N may be a favorable development for the dollar this week 
 while the pound has attempted to stabilize currency analysts say it is in critical condition 
 sterling plunged about four cents thursday and hit the week 's low of $ N when mr. lawson resigned from his <unk> post because of a policy <unk> with other cabinet members 
 he was succeeded by john major who friday expressed a desire for a firm pound and supported the relatively high british interest rates that he said are working exactly as intended in reducing inflation 
 but the market remains uneasy about mr. major 's policy strategy and the prospects for the pound currency analysts contend 
 although the bank of england 's tight monetary policy has fueled worries that britain 's slowing economy is headed for a recession it is widely believed that mr. lawson 's willingness to <unk> up the pound with interest-rate increases helped stem pound selling in recent weeks 
 if there are any signs that mr. major will be less inclined to use interest-rate boosts to rescue the pound from another plunge that currency is expected to fall sharply 
 it 's fair to say there are more risks for the pound under major than there were under lawson says malcolm roberts a director of international bond market research at salomon brothers in london 
 there 's very little upside to sterling mr. roberts says but he adds that near-term losses may be small because the selling wave that followed mr. major 's appointment apparently has run its course 
 but some other analysts have a <unk> forecast for the pound particularly because britain 's inflation is <unk> at a relatively <unk> annual rate of about N N and the nation is <unk> with a struggling government and large current account and trade deficits 
 the pound likely will fall in coming days and may trade as low as N marks within the next year says nigel <unk> an international economist at james capel & co. in london 
 the pound was at N marks late friday off sharply from N in new york trading a week earlier 
 if the pound falls closer to N marks the bank of england may raise britain 's base lending rate by one percentage point to N N says mr. <unk> 
 but such an increase he says could be viewed by the market as too little too late 
 the bank of england indicated its desire to leave its monetary policy unchanged friday by declining to raise the official N N <unk> rate that it charges discount houses analysts say 
 pound concerns aside the lack of strong buying interest in the yen is another <unk> for the dollar many traders say 
 the dollar has a natural base of support around N yen because the japanese currency has n't been purchased heavily in recent weeks says ms. <unk> of credit suisse 
 the yen 's softness she says apparently stems from japanese investors ' interest in buying dollars against the yen to purchase u.s. bond issues and persistent worries about this year 's upheaval in the japanese government

 efforts by the hong kong futures exchange to introduce a new interest-rate futures contract continue to hit <unk> despite the support the proposed instrument enjoys in the colony 's financial community 
 hong kong financial institutions have been waiting for interest-rate futures for a long time 
 the contract was first proposed more than two years ago but shortly afterward the colony 's markets were hit hard by the october N global stock crash 
 the subsequent drive to reform hong kong 's markets also has <unk> the interest-rate futures contract 
 the securities and futures commission a government <unk> set up after the N crash to try to restore confidence and order to hong kong 's markets had been expected to give the contract conditional approval last week 
 but regulators this week said <unk> officials still have a way to go before they answer all the remaining detailed questions about the contract 
 the exchange had forecast that the contract would begin trading by december 
 but securities regulators now say privately that it is n't likely to start until the first quarter of next year 
 analysts and financial officials in the british colony consider the new contract essential to the revival of the hong kong futures exchange which has never fully recovered from the october N crash 
 many believe that without a healthy futures exchange hong kong 's aspirations to be recognized as an international financial center will suffer 
 in addition local banks say the new contract is important in helping them offset their hong <unk> exposure 
 the contract will be based on the three-month hong kong interbank offered rate or <unk> 
 it is almost a carbon copy of the chicago mercantile exchange 's eurodollar contract which is based on the three-month eurodollar rate the rate paid on <unk> deposits in london banks 
 if the contract is as successful as some expect it may do much to restore confidence in futures trading in hong kong 
 the contract is definitely important to the exchange says robert <unk> executive director of the securities and futures commission 
 two years ago the futures exchange was the envy of other would-be futures centers 
 after only N months its main contract based on the hang seng index had grown to be the second-largest <unk> contract in the world 
 a futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell a commodity or financial instrument at a set price on a specified date 
 in the case of stock-index and interest-rate futures the instruments are given an underlying cash value and are settled in cash 
 but in the week following the N stock crash the exchange <unk> on collapse and the stock and futures markets in hong kong were closed for four days 
 only a <unk> bailout kept the crisis from <unk> the exchange 
 trading in hang seng index futures remains <unk> by the experience 
 volume for the entire month of september totaled only N contracts compared with a daily average of N in the month before the N crash 
 despite the thin trading and after two painful years of restructuring the futures market has shown itself to be <unk> in two recent tests 
 while asian markets struggled to cope with the uncertainty caused by the oct. N plunge in new york stock prices futures trading in hong kong was relatively heavy and went smoothly 
 that was also the case in the days following the june N massacre in beijing which caused a sharp drop in hong kong stock prices 
 there was no problem at all says douglas ford chief executive officer of the futures exchange 
 most important to the contract 's success is the commitment of hong kong 's big financial institutions especially the two leaders <unk> & shanghai banking corp. and the local subsidiary of britain 's standard chartered bank plc 
 the two big banks were instrumental in designing the new contract 
 if those two banks are there then the balance of the banking institutions will be there says mr. <unk> the securities and futures commission official 
 colony banks have a major stake in how interest rates move because of their enormous hong <unk> exposure 
 even though the currency is pegged to the u.s. dollar with a fixed exchange rate of hk$ N to the american currency the u.s. and hong kong economies do n't always move in lock step making it difficult to predict where interest rates in the colony will go 
 in early N when the three-month eurodollar rate was between N N and N N the three-month <unk> rate was as low as N N 
 just a few months ago the three-month eurodollar rate was around N N while three-month <unk> hit highs above N N 
 the <unk> contract <unk> quite a bit of the problem of interest-rate risk in the interbank market says eric <unk> a director of james capel far east ltd. the hong kong arm of the british brokerage firm 
 despite the initial support expected trading in the contract is likely to start slowly 
 the <unk> from the N crash have n't yet <unk> and not all claims against the exchange <unk> by those who bet the hang seng index would fall have been settled 
 companies and financial institutions familiar with hong kong remain wary of trading in its futures market 
 and mr. <unk> <unk> that there may be limits on how much the contract can grow because the hong kong dollar is n't a widely traded currency 
 he says the contract will be considered a success if it starts trading N to N lots a day 
 exchange officials also point out that <unk> futures were designed for institutions and corporations not for the type of small individual investors who were very active in hang seng index futures and defaulted in the N crash 
 mr. <unk> says the low margin required for trading futures attracted a lot of small investors before the N crash who did n't realize that their risk was virtually <unk> 
 you 're not going to get your taxi drivers and <unk> and all that says <unk> nicholas a director for securities company elders bullion & futures ltd

 it 's very worrying that these markets ca n't cope 
 on manic monday the volume of german shares traded in london more than tripled to N million and the volume of french shares rose N N 
 by comparison german domestic stock volume in frankfurt only doubled that day 
 the switch to the london market during such <unk> times is significant 
 for one thing the size of the affected market is enormous the european stock markets account for some N N of global stock market capitalization with an estimated value of $ N trillion according to morgan stanley capital international 
 the continental markets alone contribute about N N of estimated world market capitalization of $ N trillion 
 though the widely traded shares that are quoted in london account for only a small portion of those totals they still are the most closely watched stocks and are often viewed as a barometer for the local markets generally 
 the switch to london <unk> the fact that despite the economic restructuring associated with european community efforts to develop a single market by N european stock trading remains a highly <unk> and very <unk> activity 
 against this backdrop one thing that does n't seem likely to result from N is a single european stock market 
 rather there increasingly is a group of international brokerage and trading firms that operate in most european financial centers including european giants such as barclays bank plc and deutsche bank as well as merrill lynch & co. and shearson lehman hutton inc. of the u.s. and japan 's nomura securities co 
 these firms which often have acquired a local brokerage firm are calling the shots when it comes to deciding in which market to <unk> a trade 
 and senior officials of two u.s. securities houses say they switched trades in european stocks to the london market last week when they could n't <unk> positions on the continent 
 meantime brokers on the continent are worried too mostly by the potential loss of business 
 i would be much <unk> if this volume in german stocks were in frankfurt rather than london says <unk> <unk> head of international equity sales at dresdner bank in frankfurt 
 he acknowledges that spreads were too wide and volumes too light in the extreme conditions on manic monday 
 already the germans appear to be acting at a special meeting on the day of the decline directors of the frankfurt stock exchange voted to extend their trading hours although they have n't decided when or by how much

 says a spokeswoman for the brussels <unk> nobody around here will tell you they are happy the system did n't work

 investors can be assured now that this kind of problem can never occur again 
 but for others the <unk> echo the promises made after the N stock crash when similar problems led many markets to develop the new systems that performed so badly last week 
 they all said they invested huge amounts of money 
 but they either did n't buy the right machines or they wasted it says fleming 's ms. noble

 european community employers fear that the ec commission 's plans for a charter of fundamental social rights is a danger to industrial competitiveness 
 we do n't want brussels deciding conditions for workers unless they are necessary and useful said <unk> <unk> secretary general of the employers ' confederation <unk> 
 <unk> an <unk> for the union of industrial and employers ' <unk> of europe fears that the charter will force ec countries to adopt a single pattern in labor relations 
 workers and management mr. <unk> said would lose the flexibility and diversity that has so far allowed them to <unk> to local conditions and <unk> 
 the british government also strongly opposes the charter in its current form 
 it argues as does <unk> that labor relations are best left to be regulated at the national level 
 france will propose a slightly <unk> version of the charter to be discussed by ec <unk> ministers on monday officials said 
 but the cosmetic changes are n't expected to win over britain 
 we still have serious differences with the text a british official said because it provides for a regulation of the labor market 
 mr. <unk> said the charter would put poorer ec countries such as spain greece and portugal at a disadvantage 
 it would force these countries to introduce minimum standards for pay and working hours and provide for collective bargaining and worker participation in major corporate decisions 
 this he warned would prevent these countries from <unk> the difference with their richer ec <unk> 
 indeed lower wages in greece they are a third of the ec average are n't enough to offset higher transport costs and lower productivity in the southern countries 
 increasing labor costs mr. <unk> argued would only put the countries at a further disadvantage in competing in the <unk> ec market planned for after N 
 but the <unk> official said that producing a charter acceptable to both britain and european industry is n't an <unk> goal 
 the charter would just have to be restricted to a list of workers ' fundamental rights without seeking to impose any <unk> 
 a key provision in the current version of the charter would give the commission a mandate to produce an action program detailing on what points ec member states would be required to comply with the goals set out in the charter 
 this provision lies at the heart of the british and <unk> fears of social engineering by the commission 
 one possible political solution an ec official said would be for the commission to present the action program in late november before the adoption of the charter at a summit of ec governments on dec. N and N 
 this would leave britain free to adopt the charter after having <unk> the action program 
 the charter was approved by the ec commission on sept. N

 after a three-year nightmare of uncertain oil prices <unk> budget cuts and sweeping layoffs fear is finally leaving the oil patch 
 independent <unk> are <unk> sinking <unk> into the earth 's <unk> again 
 some in big oil are easing the grip on their <unk> 
 investment capital is creeping back and oil properties are <unk> more 
 <unk> prices are even <unk> up 
 what happened 
 in <unk> terms stability has quietly settled into international oil markets 
 mideast politics have <unk> down and the <unk> within the organization of petroleum exporting countries seems under control for now 
 the fundamentals of supply and demand once again are setting oil prices says victor <unk> an arthur <unk> & co. oil expert 
 after years of wild swings oil prices over the last N months have settled at around $ N to $ N a barrel 
 that is n't the $ N that <unk> producers a decade ago or the $ N that pleased users a year ago 
 but it is high enough to <unk> the search for future supplies low enough to promote consumption and most important steady enough for both producers and users to believe in 
 not that oil suddenly is a sure thing again 
 the current <unk> is fragile and depends on steady strong demand and continued relative harmony within opec producer of more than N N of the <unk> world 's crude 
 a recession or new opec <unk> could put oil markets right back in the soup 
 also the new <unk> are <unk> and some question their extent 
 drilling activity is still far below eight years ago there 's no hiring surge and some companies continue to shrink 
 with all this even the most wary oil men agree something has changed 
 it does n't appear to be getting worse 
 that in itself has got to cause people to feel a little more optimistic says glenn cox the president of phillips petroleum co 
 though modest the change reaches beyond the oil patch too 
 the same roller-coaster prices that halted u.s. oil exploration and drove many veteran oil men and companies out of the business also played havoc with the nation 's inflation rate the trade deficit and oil users ' corporate and personal budgets 
 now at least some <unk> has returned for everyone from economists to <unk>

 management does n't want surprises notes jack <unk> who as <unk> director at american airlines buys some N billion gallons of jet fuel a year 
 prices had been so unstable that two years ago mr. <unk> gave up on long-term forecasts 
 and consumers should be comfortable adds w. <unk> moore u.s. deputy secretary of energy 
 i do n't see anything on the horizon that could lead to a <unk> rise in the price 
 the catalyst for all this has been opec 
 about a year ago it ended an <unk> <unk> internal production war that had put prices on a roller <unk> and pitched oil towns from houston to <unk> into recession 
 saudi arabia opec 's <unk> abandoned a policy of flooding the market to punish <unk> 
 about the same time the <unk> war which was <unk> oil markets ended 
 in addition global petroleum demand has been climbing 
 it is projected to keep growing by a million barrels a day or up to N N annually for years to come 
 for opec that 's ideal 
 the resulting firm prices and stability will allow both producers and consumers to plan <unk> says saudi <unk> oil minister <unk> <unk> 
 opec <unk> <unk> explains consumers offer security of markets while opec provides security of supply 
 this is an <unk> time to find mutual ways to prevent price shocks from happening again he says 
 to promote this balance opec now is finally <unk> a <unk> internal problem 
 at its november meeting it will try to revise its quotas to satisfy persian gulf members that can produce far more oil than their <unk> 
 being held well below capacity greatly <unk> them and has led to widespread cheating 
 opec has repeatedly raised its <unk> production ceiling to <unk> some of that unauthorized output 
 oil ministers now hope to solve the issue for good through an iranian proposal that gives a larger share of output to countries with surplus capacity and reduces the shares of those that ca n't produce more anyway 
 but if they walk out without any effort to resolve their problem production could increase to N million or N million barrels a day making for a very troublesome first quarter warns <unk> <unk> a consultant and former <unk> opec delegate 
 that would send prices <unk> from what some <unk> u.s. oil executives still regard as too low a level 
 patrick <unk> early president of amoco corp. 's <unk> unit says that despite recent stability he plans continued tightening of costs and exploration spending

 five were interested 
 mitchell energy & development corp. became the partner <unk> up more than half of the $ N in drilling and start-up costs 
 mitchell will get a <unk> in the oil 
 a kind of <unk> mentality had been <unk> activity says don <unk> mitchell 's oil exploration chief 
 now everybody is a lot more optimistic 
 one attraction for oil operators here and in other fields is the <unk> cost of drilling and equipment reflecting service companies ' <unk> for work 
 <unk> oil co. a small texas independent is currently drilling two wells itself and putting money into three others 
 one of its wells in southwestern oklahoma is a rank <unk> a risky well where oil previously has n't been found 
 at this price $ N plus or minus and with costs being significantly less than they were several years ago the economics are pretty good says george <unk> head of the company 
 if you know you 've got stability in price you can do things you would n't do with the volatility of the past few years 
 the activity is enough to move some <unk> prices back up a little 
 some <unk> prices have risen N N in the past month 
 in the gulf of mexico a boat to deliver supplies to offshore <unk> now costs around $ N a day up nearly N N since june 
 some service <unk> recently were auctioned for about $ N million each up from less than $ N million two years ago 
 at the bottom of the slump <unk> inc. was discounting N N on an electronic evaluation of a well now it discounts about N N <unk> say 
 still there is money to be made 
 most oil companies when they set exploration and production budgets for this year forecast revenue of $ N for each barrel of crude produced 
 prices have averaged more than $ N a barrel higher than that not a <unk> but at least a <unk> bonus for them 
 so according to a dun & bradstreet corp. survey companies that had been refusing to spend even their very conservative budgets may loosen up before year end 
 it says N N of those surveyed report that N exploration spending will exceed N 's 
 funds for drilling may inch up more next year if oil prices stay stable

 only N wells including N dry <unk> were <unk> for oil and natural gas in the u.s. in the first nine months of the year down N N from the like N period

 contrary to what might be expected based on the headline on john r. dorfman 's recent money matters article pros hit <unk> right where it <unk> oct. N i was able to stand <unk> before my <unk> finance students and <unk> that the findings of your <unk> experiment on stock picking is completely consistent with what they have been taught in the classroom 
 in particular i do not find the fact that your group of pros ' monthly <unk> of four stocks <unk> the market in general to be <unk> with market efficiency 
 mr. dorfman states that an investor who invested $ N a year ago in the first four stocks selected by your pros and then sold those one month later purchasing the four new pro picks and repeated this process for the year would have accumulated $ N excluding account dividends taxes and commissions 
 in contrast an investor holding the dow jones portfolio over the year would have accumulated only $ N 
 accepted theories of asset pricing offer a perfectly legitimate explanation 
 accepted theories state that investors require higher returns on riskier investments 
 thus rather than seeing the excess returns to the <unk> portfolio as being <unk> i see those returns as simply <unk> for taking on added risk 
 i believe the risk for each individual stock selected by your pros is very large 
 if you asked me to select a stock with the highest expected return i would select a stock with the greatest amount of <unk> risk as i am sure your pros do 
 your hypothetical investor is simply being <unk> for taking on this added risk 
 moreover your hypothetical investor has <unk> the gains to be had in reducing risk by diversifying his portfolio 
 a <unk> portfolio is still exposed to a great deal of unnecessary risk 
 this means the returns can vary a great deal 
 mr. dorfman provides confirming evidence of this phenomenon when he reports that your staff of <unk> <unk> would have accumulated only $ N by <unk> <unk> four new stocks to be held in a portfolio each month 
 scott e. <unk> texas <unk> university <unk> texas your investment <unk> article misses the target 
 the fact that stock pickers have <unk> a <unk> selected portfolio in eight of N months has no bearing on the <unk> theory 
 what matters is that the stocks recommended by your pros tend to be substantially riskier than a diversified portfolio 
 for example your pickers ' recommendations for the coming month are on average N N riskier than holding the market portfolio according to value line 's beta estimates 
 james morgan 's pick for october <unk> is a substantial N N riskier than the market portfolio his <unk> <unk> <unk> pick is N N riskier

 texans get reasonable car rental insurance 
 consumer advocates have long claimed that car rental companies charge too much for car rental insurance 
 now a new law in texas seems to be providing the proof 
 the law the first of its kind requires car rental companies in texas to charge only reasonable rates for <unk> waiver insurance 
 specifically the law says the rates must closely reflect what the company 's actual expenses have been to replace damaged cars 
 before the law went into effect last month car rental companies were charging as much as $ N a day for the waiver in texas 
 now they 're charging as little $ N a day 
 if they 're telling the truth now then they 've been charging N N more than what is reasonable says steve <unk> an assistant state attorney general in texas

 flight attendants lag before jets even land 
 if your flight <unk> seems a little <unk> it may be because he or she has been working N straight hours 
 a recent study for the federal aviation administration found that major airlines sometimes make flight attendants work N hours or more straight despite union contracts at some airlines limiting duty time to N hours 
 some flight attendants on charter planes are putting in <unk> work days the study found 
 this happens because the faa does n't have any rules on duty time for flight attendants by contrast it strictly restricts duty time for pilots and air traffic controllers usually to a maximum of N consecutive hours 
 as far as the faa is concerned says <unk> <unk> air safety director at the association of flight attendants flight attendants can work an <unk> number of hours 
 experts say such long hours for attendants pose a safety risk 
 for instance tired flight attendants might not react quickly enough during an emergency evacuation 
 at the end of their day they are <unk> says john <unk> president of the aviation safety institute a <unk> group in <unk> ohio 
 they have to work such long hours and then we expect them to be heroes if there 's an evacuation 
 in response to the study the faa says it is considering changing its policy or lack of it on flight attendants

 why do you continually ignore the <unk> effects of indexing the basis of capital gains for inflation 
 why do you maintain the house-passed capital-gains plan is a temporary reduction when it is not 
 i think the reason is that you are confusing tax rates with tax payments 
 your sept. N page-one story on the house-passed capital-gains plan is a good example 
 you lead readers to believe that the house reduced the capital-gains tax for two years only 
 you virtually ignore the <unk> power of indexation which in many cases is more substantial than a lower rate 
 the monetary tax benefit of indexation for all gains in excess of inflation can be measured using the following equation tax rate times inflation rate times basis for the gain 
 depending on the size of the gain and the rate of inflation indexation can mean a lower tax payment than using the N N rate without indexation 
 but in any event and this is the important point tax payments on capital gains will be lower with indexation than under current law even though the tax rate is the same under both systems 
 as you can see the capital-gains reduction plan adopted by the house would not be temporary but permanent 
 i hope that you begin talking about the plan 's permanent and in my view most beneficial feature indexation 
 rep. robert k. <unk> r. calif washington 
 that the <unk> for the two-year reduction to N N is budgetary does not mean it is not in the public interest 
 the reduction <unk> the burden on portfolio changes and <unk> capital to seek more productive or more appropriate uses 
 but what is really significant is the indexation of capital gains after N 
 to argue that this is not likely to affect the economy in positive ways is contrary both to recent experience with capital-gains tax cuts and to common sense

 the financial accounting standards board said it will soon issue a rule requiring disclosure about the financial risk of certain financial instruments 
 but the chief <unk> body for accountants backed off one part of its original proposal made earlier this year that would have required a breakdown of certain <unk> items related to <unk> sheet instruments 
 the <unk> detail was opposed by many banks and thrifts that felt the cost of supplying such data was n't worth the value of the disclosures 
 under the initial proposal for example banks would have been required to disclose that portion of <unk> for loan losses that reflects specific letters of credit for which customers had defaulted 
 the final rule wo n't require such a breakdown of the <unk> for loan losses which appears on the balance sheet 
 the fasb rule will cover such financial instruments as interest rate swaps financial guarantees <unk> interest rate contracts loan contracts loan commitments and options written on <unk> held 
 it will require companies to <unk> out in more detail collateral <unk> and <unk> of credit risk for all financial instruments 
 the rule will require companies with financial instruments that have <unk> sheet risks to disclose data about the value and terms of the instruments any accounting loss that would occur if the outside party involved in the instrument failed to perform and the company 's policy for requiring collateral or other security for the instrument

 among other reasons high fees regulators imposed on certain transfers of thrift deposits to commercial banks substantially altered the economics of the transaction for both parties poughkeepsie said 
 additionally the bank is increasing its loan-loss reserves for the third quarter by $ N million before taxes 
 in the year-earlier third quarter poughkeepsie savings had net income of $ N million or N cents a share 
 poughkeepsie said it is continuing to try to sell itself under a june agreement with a <unk> group 
 the bank also said its effort would continue past the nov. N deadline set in that agreement and that the litigation between the two sides might resume as a result

 a potentially safer whooping cough vaccine made by novel genetic engineering techniques was described by a team of italian u.s. and japanese scientists 
 the team reported they managed to induce bacteria to produce a <unk> version of the <unk> produced by the bacterium that causes whooping cough 
 laboratory tests showed that <unk> versions of the <unk> are capable of <unk> an <unk> to whooping cough the researchers reported in this week 's issue of the journal science 
 the current vaccine for whooping cough or pertussis is part of the <unk> for <unk> pertussis <unk> shot given most <unk> and young children 
 the vaccine is effective in preventing a disease that still <unk> about N million children a year world-wide causing an estimated one million deaths 
 the vaccine however causes <unk> reactions that can be fatal 
 the reactions stem from the fact that the vaccine contains multiple copies of the whole <unk> pertussis bacterium which causes whooping cough 
 this bacterium produces a toxin that if used as a vaccine can induce <unk> to whooping cough 
 unfortunately the toxin is also <unk> 
 the <unk> scientific team said they had succeeded in getting bacteria to produce a <unk> version of the pertussis toxin which could be used as a safe vaccine 
 the researchers reported they have been able to <unk> the five genes that produced the toxin out of the pertussis bacterium 
 it turned out that although it took all five genes to produce the toxin only one was responsible for the toxin 's <unk> 
 ordinarily in genetic engineering each of these genes minus the one that caused the <unk> would have been transferred to another bacterium called e. <unk> which would then produce a <unk> version of the toxin 
 the researchers said they did this but the toxin did n't induce <unk> to whooping cough 
 the scientists then took the five toxin genes and triggered a <unk> in the one gene that caused <unk> 
 then using a new technique called <unk> <unk> for introducing genes into cells they transferred all five genes to bacteria closely related to the pertussis <unk> 
 these <unk> <unk> ordinarily do n't make the toxin 
 but the genes were accompanied by a piece of dna called a <unk> that turns the genes on 
 the new bacteria recipients of the genes began producing pertussis toxin which because of the <unk> <unk> gene was no longer toxic 
 experiments showed that the new <unk> toxin is capable of <unk> <unk> according to the researchers from the <unk> research center in <unk> italy the medical college of wisconsin in milwaukee and the japanese national institutes of health

 at a time when foreign banks are pouring vast resources and personnel into west germany 's financial center the opening of a <unk> office on a frankfurt side street should n't attract much attention 
 unless of course it happens to be run by the rothschilds 
 after an <unk> absence from the <unk> of the family banking empire the return of the rothschild group to frankfurt was greeted by the glare of television lights <unk> reporters and a mayoral reception in town hall 
 like other foreign banks establishing a presence here the family describes its move as a calculated decision to set up a financial services <unk> in europe 's largest economy ahead of the integration of european community markets after N 
 yet the rothschilds do n't deny an emotional element to the decision 
 in N mayer <unk> rothschild founded <unk> <unk> rothschild & sons and later sent his four sons to london paris vienna and <unk> to begin the bank 's expansion during the early 19th century 
 the original bank in frankfurt closed in N after the death of <unk> carl von rothschild and the family 's banking activities focused on london and paris 
 <unk> <unk> de rothschild the family 's <unk> spokesman explains that by the end of the 19th century berlin had replaced frankfurt as germany 's financial center 
 yet the chief reason for the <unk> he says was rooted in a family tradition that would n't allow a bank to bear the rothschild name without a rothschild in its management 
 at the time we had only daughters explains the <unk> <unk> so we had to close the bank 
 much of the family 's <unk> remained 
 although its <unk> residence was destroyed by <unk> during world war ii the rothschilds ' place in frankfurt 's history is still recalled by the city park and a street bearing the rothschild name 
 the family 's long absence is <unk> 
 the family was in allied countries during both world war i and the long period of economic <unk> of the 1920s 
 during the third reich the rothschilds were a target of <unk> propaganda against jewish financiers 
 the <unk> pursued the rothschilds across europe as the <unk> grabbed countries <unk> the family 's property in the process 
 american journalist william l. <unk> in his book the rise and fall of the third reich wrote of how in vienna he had <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> men <unk> off silver <unk> paintings and other <unk> from the rothschild palace 
 in the immediate postwar years the rothschilds concentrated on rebuilding their other european operations delaying their return to frankfurt 
 for a member of the rothschild family the return to frankfurt is a very meaningful event although it might not mean as much to german banking as it means to us says <unk> david de rothschild <unk> 's younger <unk> and a partner in rothschild & cie banque in paris 
 indeed the competition is n't greatly concerned 
 it would be surprising if they did n't come to frankfurt in time for N and they bring an interesting tradition 
 but the market really is n't going to be stood on its head said a banker at one of frankfurt 's big three banks 
 the return of the rothschilds is modest 
 the new representative office with one manager and two <unk> none a member of the rothschild family will carry out no banking operations of its own 
 instead it is to seek out corporate financing business and sell investment products on behalf of the family 's mainstay banking units <unk> <unk> rothschild & sons ltd. in london rothschild & cie. in paris and rothschild bank ag in zurich 
 the constraints do n't bother the office 's <unk> manager erich <unk> 
 he left his job as general manager of shearson lehman hutton holdings inc. 's frankfurt office because he says when the rothschilds called i could n't resist 
 each rothschild bank is linked by family ties and <unk> 
 in march <unk> <unk> rothschild in london and rothschild bank in zurich showed assets of # N billion $ N billion and N billion swiss francs $ N million respectively 
 the paris bank does n't publish that figure 
 in europe the rothschilds banks are focusing on mergers and acquisitions as european industry <unk> ahead of N 
 yet the group 's limited resources makes it a niche player 
 obviously there are <unk> limitations on the assistance we can provide concedes <unk> david de rothschild but we feel we have some cards to play 
 among them he says is the family 's traditional ties to old wealth and <unk> in banking and industry throughout europe and beyond 
 the rothschilds hope to use a long history in private banking and an <unk> of exclusivity to attract private and institutional investors 
 as at the zurich bank the minimum investment for individuals will be high about a million german marks $ N three times what many other west german investment banks require 
 but we do make exceptions says a smiling <unk> <unk> de rothschild especially if they are very young and have very rich parents 
 as program trading comes under renewed attack for causing stock market gyrations a few people on wall street say it is time to consider extreme measures 
 the real answer to curbing wild swings in stock prices they say might be to curb or even abolish stock-index futures 
 a stock-index future is a contract to buy or sell the market value of a basket of stocks such as the standard & poor 's 500-stock index 
 since stock futures were created in N trading on the chicago mercantile exchange and other exchanges has <unk> to the point where trading in stock-index futures rivals that in the stocks themselves 
 the conventional view as voiced by goldman sachs & co. partner <unk> black is that stocks and <unk> such as futures and options form a single market and that <unk> make it a more liquid market 
 but increasingly people are questioning that view and the critics include some of the country 's most successful investors 
 warren buffett has been on record as opposing stock-index futures since their inception in N 
 and mario <unk> another star in the investing world says my gut says the <unk> of futures and <unk> far outweigh the benefits 
 like others mr. <unk> says that if futures cause investors to lose confidence in stocks they will move away from stocks as many have already done 
 and those who remain he says will demand a higher return and over time raise the cost of capital to companies 
 essentially the critics of stock-index futures fall into two camps 
 one group says the futures contribute to stock market volatility the other contends that futures are a <unk> of speculation that <unk> from the stock market 's basic function of raising capital 
 before futures says new york investor michael <unk> you actually had to pay attention to whether the thing you were buying had any <unk> value 
 while it was once expected that futures would mimic stock prices traders now routinely check the futures markets in chicago before they buy or sell stocks 
 when chicago futures prices jump up or down the new york stock exchange follows 
 on tuesday for instance the dow jones industrial average plunged N points in little more than an hour 
 then in the space of a <unk> coffee break the average rallied almost all of the way back 
 paul <unk> who manages more than $ N billion of investments at <unk> capital management inc. blames futures markets for leading the way 
 the fundamentals do n't change in an hour he says 
 i think they should close down the futures exchange and then we could get back to investing 
 index arbitrage the <unk> buying and selling of stocks offset with opposite trades in futures is frequently blamed for adding to stock market volatility 
 although index arbitrage is said to add liquidity to markets john <unk> managing partner of edward d. jones says too much liquidity is n't a good thing 
 the kind of instant liquidity that is implied by index futures is that you can buy a portfolio over two years and get out in one day 
 it 's too <unk> he says 
 it is n't investing 
 but stock-index futures have plenty of support 
 defenders say futures make markets more efficient and provide ways for investors to reduce risks 
 they note that stocks experienced volatile swings long before futures 
 and defenders say few people complain about futures when stock prices are rising 
 louis <unk> managing director in charge of equity options and futures at salomon inc. says that trading baskets of stocks began in the 1970s a decade before the advent of futures 
 futures he says merely cut down on trading costs 
 he says blaming futures is like blaming the <unk> 
 since stock-index arbitrage merely narrows the gap between prices in the futures and stock markets it ca n't add to volatility he says 
 futures do n't need defending says andrew <unk> a spokesman for the chicago mercantile exchange which trades the s&p N by far the largest stock-index futures contract 
 despite the current outcry over stock market volatility few people expect stock futures to disappear 
 for one thing the chicago futures exchanges have political and financial clout including many friends in congress 
 and traders say that futures have become an accepted part of the financial landscape 
 all life is about change either you <unk> or die says one chicago futures trader 
 if futures are n't permitted here we 'll take it to australia or tokyo 
 average daily volume in s&p N futures last year was N contracts 
 based on yesterday 's closing price of the s&p the average value of one day 's trading amounts to $ N billion 
 by contrast average dollar volume on the big board last year was $ N billion 
 many investment managers say futures are useful as a way to hedge portfolios 
 if managers fear that the overall stock market will fall but want to continue owning stocks they can hold on to specific stocks and sell a corresponding amount of futures contracts 
 average daily volume in s&p N futures last year was N contracts 
 based on yesterday 's closing price of the s&p the average value of one day 's trading amounts to $ N billion 
 by contrast average dollar volume on the big board last year was $ N billion 
 many investment managers say futures are useful as a way to hedge portfolios 
 if managers fear that the overall stock market will fall but want to continue owning stocks they can hold on to specific stocks and sell a corresponding amount of futures contracts 
 and although criticism of futures generally comes from wall street one chicago futures trader notes that brokerage firms rely on futures as hedging tools when they buy and sell big blocks of stocks from institutions 
 one reason futures are said to add volatility is that unlike in stocks people can speculate in futures with little money down 
 margin requirements for speculators on the chicago mercantile exchange are currently about N N 
 for $ N million you can move $ N million of stocks a specialist on the big board <unk> 
 that gives futures traders a lot more power 
 by contrast an investor in stocks must put up N N in cash 
 some critics say futures encourage people to think of stocks as a single commodity rather than as investments in individual businesses 
 thus they say futures inhibit the basic purpose of the stock market to accurately price securities so that capital and investment flows where it 's needed most 
 the s&p N index futures transferred the identity of N stocks into one unit making them a simple commodity to trade says george <unk> senior vice president at a. webster <unk> in philadelphia 
 it took away the need to know the bad third-quarter report of ibm for example mr. <unk> says 
 of course portfolio trading the increasingly common practice of buying or selling baskets of actual stocks also <unk> stocks as <unk> commodities 
 there is a class of investor that wants to be exposed to the whole market says <unk> <unk> assistant vice president at travelers investment management co 
 the s&p futures are merely a cheaper and <unk> way to get access to all N stocks he says 
 the big board yesterday began trading in its own basket trading vehicle representing the s&p N stocks 
 but owning index futures is n't the same as owning the underlying stocks 
 stockholders as a group can win because they own a share of corporate earnings which can grow and boost stock prices 
 futures on the other hand are a zero sum game a market for making side bets about the direction of stock prices 
 you do n't own anything says stephen boesel a money manager for t. rowe price in baltimore 
 you 're making a pure bet on the market 
 the european community commission challenged an agreement on routes and fares between france 's two largest airlines on antitrust grounds 
 meeting in <unk> wednesday the commission voted as expected to formally object to the accord between air france the state-owned airline and state-controlled domestic carrier air <unk> 
 an ec spokesman said the two companies will be notified so they can begin negotiations with brussels on how to modify the pact 
 at issue is an accord dating back to march in which air france gained access to five domestic french routes under air <unk> 's flight numbers and the domestic airline got to fly to five cities outside of france under the flag of air france 
 the two shared results from this route swap and followed rules on ticket pricing 
 the ec commission decided that such an accord does n't benefit consumers enough to merit an exemption from antitrust law 
 the airlines presented it as offering consumers more choice and better flight connections 
 an air france spokeswoman said we 're absolutely ready to study all solutions 
 an air <unk> spokesman said because they the ec have doubts we will work again on the text and the <unk> of the accord

 elizabeth <unk> district attorney for brooklyn n.y. said the appellate division has agreed with our view that despite federal <unk> laws state prosecutors have the power to protect working people 
 lawyers for the company and executives could n't be reached for comment

 general motors corp. wants to buy as much as N N of jaguar plc marking its first <unk> in a possible <unk> battle against ford motor co. for control of the british car maker 
 gm sought u.s. antitrust clearance last week to purchase more than $ N million worth of jaguar shares but does n't own any yet according to gm officials here and at the company 's detroit headquarters 
 the no. N u.s. auto maker then wrote jaguar that it intends to go to that N N level once it wins the u.s. clearance to go beyond $ N million a jaguar spokesman said yesterday 
 the gm move follows tuesday 's declaration by ford which holds an unwelcome N N stake in jaguar that it is prepared to bid for the entire company 
 gm is close to completing a friendly deal with jaguar that is likely to involve an eventual N N stake and joint manufacturing ventures 
 speculative investors betting on an imminent clash between ford and gm pushed up jaguar 's share price five pence eight u.s. cents to a <unk> N pence $ N in late trading on london 's stock exchange yesterday 
 since tuesday the shares have gained nearly N N 
 but an <unk> bidding war between the world 's top auto giants for britain 's leading luxury-car maker seems unlikely 
 we will not go over a certain level said david n. <unk> ford 's vice president for finance at a news conference yesterday in dearborn mich 
 there 's some price at which we 'd stop bidding 
 he would n't specify what it was 
 and powerful political pressures may convince the conservative government to keep its so-called golden share which limits any individual holding to N N until the restriction expires on dec. N N 
 i really do n't see the government doing something that jaguar does n't want over the next N months said kenneth warren a conservative member of parliament and chairman of the select committee on trade and industry in britain 's house of commons 
 the golden share is a single share but it is the magic share 
 the government retained the single share after selling its stake in jaguar in N part of a <unk> practice of protecting former government-owned enterprises to <unk> criticism of privatization 
 the N N restriction covers any would-be suitor british or foreign 
 ford is willing to bid for N N of jaguar 's shares if both the government and jaguar shareholders agree to relax the anti-takeover barrier <unk> 
 as jaguar 's biggest holder and britain 's biggest car maker ford could turn up the heat by <unk> a special shareholders ' meeting and urging holders to drop the limits early 
 ford might succeed because many shareholders are speculators keen for a full bid or institutional investors unhappy over jaguar management 's handling of its current financial difficulties 
 the government probably would n't give in readily to a hostile <unk> by ford however 
 it has <unk> a golden share only once before during british petroleum co. 's # N billion $ N billion takeover of <unk> plc in N 
 in wooing british lawmakers gm has pointed out that its willingness to settle for a minority stake would keep jaguar <unk> and independent 
 this week the u.s. auto giant paid for N house of commons members and two house of <unk> members to fly to detroit and tour its operations there 
 while the visit was unrelated to jaguar gm chairman roger smith answered the legislators ' questions about it over lunch tuesday 
 he said jaguar should n't be <unk> by anyone else recalled one participant 
 politics also influences the government 's thinking on the anti-takeover restriction 
 the conservatives do n't <unk> jeopardize marginal <unk> seats in <unk> where jaguar has headquarters nor can the government easily back down on promised protection for a privatized company while it proceeds with controversial plans to <unk> most of britain 's water and electricity industries 
 prime minister margaret thatcher might however be <unk> to any request by jaguar chairman sir john <unk> for the restriction 's early removal to let gm <unk> more than N N or mount a friendly suitor bid against ford 
 in the end sir john rather than the government or jaguar shareholders may hold the key that <unk> the golden share 
 swedish <unk> and <unk> group ab skf said its pretax profit rose N N to N billion kronor $ N million in the first nine months from one billion kronor $ N million in the corresponding period a year earlier 
 skf said sales increased N N to N billion kronor from N billion 
 earnings per share were N kronor compared with N kronor 
 skf said demand for the group 's main product rolling bearings remained favorable in europe which accounts for slightly more than two-thirds of group sales 
 latin american markets continued their recovery after a weak start to the year skf said 
 the company said the situation in the u.s. is still uncertain as reduced production in the country 's automotive industry has resulted in weakened demand for rolling bearings 
 analysts said skf 's results for the first nine months lived up to market expectations as brokerage firms had predicted a pretax profit of N billion to N billion kronor 
 the three business areas engaged in rolling bearing operations continued to show favorable sales development 
 sales of rolling bearings increased N N to N billion kronor from N billion kronor in the corresponding period the previous year

 when president bush <unk> to costa rica today he 'll go with little of the fanfare that <unk> many of his foreign <unk> 
 but the two-day trip still has managed to fuel controversy over his administration 's policies in central america 
 some conservatives say mr. bush should n't make the trip during which he will participate in costa rica 's celebration of N years of democracy 
 these critics object to mr. bush 's participation in a meeting that includes nicaraguan president daniel ortega among the guests 
 in addition they argue he wo n't help washington 's standing in the region by <unk> the u.s. commitment to democracy less than a month after his administration played an <unk> role in the failed coup attempt in panama 
 i believe it will do more damage than good because it will <unk> people like daniel ortega says <unk> windsor who served as u.s. ambassador to costa rica during the reagan administration 
 mr. windsor among other analysts connected to the conservative heritage foundation fears the gathering of N leaders mostly from central american nations will force mr. bush to explain and redeem himself in the wake of charges that the u.s. failed to do enough to aid the removal of panamanian dictator manuel noriega 
 at the same time liberal and moderate democrats note the irony of mr. bush 's joining a celebration of costa rican democracy at a time his administration has sought sharp cuts in u.s. aid to the tiny country 
 the administration proposed only $ N million in so-called economic support funds for costa rica this year down from the $ N million the u.s. provided last year 
 the administration said improvements in costa rica 's economic condition warrant the cut in aid which the country uses mainly to make payments on its $ N billion foreign debt 
 but costa rican officials argue that the recent drop in coffee prices combined with the country 's continuing struggle to <unk> its economy make the support as necessary as ever 
 we are crossing the river and we need a little more help to get to the other side said <unk> <unk> an economic affairs specialist at the costa rican embassy in washington 
 democrats argue that costa rica deserves more assistance for the same reason that mr. bush is attending the celebration this weekend to reward the country for its stability in a region <unk> with turmoil and for its efforts to promote peace in nicaragua 
 however peace efforts by costa rican president <unk> arias have n't always helped the country 's cause in washington 
 mr. arias 's <unk> refusal to support the u.s. 's campaign against leftist nicaragua earned him the <unk> of the reagan white house 
 and more recently he insisted on signing a <unk> agreement intended to <unk> nicaragua 's <unk> contra rebels faster than the bush administration would prefer 
 i think bush 's going there is a helpful sign said sen. terry sanford d. n.c a member of the foreign relations committee who pushed to provide costa rica about the same amount of aid as it received last year 
 lawmakers in both houses support the higher level 
 administration officials defend mr. bush 's decision to make the trip 
 while they acknowledge the president will attend several meals and a working session also attended by mr. ortega they insist that mr. bush wo n't be extending the nicaraguan leader any special <unk> 
 the administration also made clear its continuing <unk> for the leftist nicaraguan government in recent days <unk> a package of electoral aid to the nicaraguan opposition renewing the u.s. trade <unk> against the country and continuing to complain that the country supports rebel groups in the region 
 officials also insist mr. bush will use the trip to highlight his own initiatives for pushing democracy in the region fighting illegal drugs and <unk> the less developed countries 
 let me say there is a <unk> component to this trip secretary of state james baker told reporters wednesday 
 there wo n't be any formal resolutions or <unk> i do n't think 
 but we still see this as an opportunity to discuss many many very important issues 
 in N the presidents commission of the ncaa which oversees most u.s. <unk> sports contracted with the washington-based american institutes for research to do a survey on the college <unk> of what the body chooses to call <unk> 
 a brief executive summary was issued last april and attracted some but not much attention 
 <unk> reports followed and attracted even less notice 
 i suspect i may be one of the few people to have read them all 
 the sixth and last report now is out and it puts the effort in perspective 
 titled comments from students it focuses on the real shame of college sports what happens to young athletes once they enter <unk> 
 it 's little less than a cry for help from those who make the costly show possible 
 the previous five reports were mainly statistical but clear enough in <unk> 
 they showed that participants in division i football and men 's basketball the big-time revenue sports entered school with poorer high-school grades and test scores than <unk> <unk> and students who participated in other <unk> activities and they got lower grades once they got there at least partly because of the athletic demands placed on them 
 the football and basketball players spent more time on their sports in season than they did on class attendance and <unk> combined N hours a week <unk> N 
 almost half N N reported suffering mental abuse from coaches and almost <unk> N N said they had been pressured to ignore injuries 
 but even those numbers do n't describe the situation as well as the athletes do in their own words 
 the composite portrait that emerges is n't of a <unk> <unk> marking time until he can land a <unk> pro contract he 's part of a tiny minority 
 rather it 's of a kid we 're talking about N to N year <unk> here having a tough time making the best of what will probably be his one shot at college 
 the <unk> question coming at the end of a lengthy confidential <unk> was this are there things about your college life you would like to tell us that we did n't ask about 
 of the almost N athletes surveyed N took the time to respond 
 here are a few of their answers they say that i am a <unk> but really i 'm an <unk> 
 they <unk> to me on the recruiting trip 
 football is the no. N thing here 
 junior football player 
 being a <unk> at college is a lot different from high school 
 first the sport you play is no longer a game it becomes a job 
 your coaches demand a lot more out of you even though some of them are not willing to take the time to watch you progress 
 you become <unk> 
 your interest is not taken to heart because people only care about your performance 
 freshman basketball player 
 the coaches should have a more personal and sympathetic attitude toward the athletes not treat us like pieces of meat 
 they always say to get a degree first but they do n't allow us time or to <unk> practice to study for a test 
 they just want to get their job done at any cost to the <unk> 
 freshman football player 
 the pressure put on us to win at all times has resulted in physical violence such as <unk> and <unk> by coaches 
 some days the coaches make you feel as though you are part of a large <unk> of animals 
 in other words they treat you like a piece of meat 
 <unk> football player 
 playing <unk> sports does n't give you a lot of time to spend with others 
 we are almost left out of campus social activities 
 this mostly happens because we go from football in the fall to lifting in the winter to football again in the spring 
 freshman football player 
 you talk about free time <unk> free time 
 time to relax and enjoy ourselves is always taken up by something to do with football meetings lifting <unk> <unk> or films 
 there is no recovery period it 's go go go 
 abuse to our bodies is overwhelming 
 with our schedule it 's hard to sleep well knowing what is going to happen the next day 
 junior football player 
 physical <unk> and depression are common in my life and in some of my <unk> ' lives 
 football player class unspecified 
 more often than not college athletes go through college never really experiencing <unk> life to the <unk> 
 one has to establish one 's own identity away from athletics and make athletics only a part not a whole of the <unk> 's life 
 <unk> basketball player 
 somehow and i do n't know how the game needs to be played for fun again and not for the big bowl revenues or lucrative tv contracts 
 <unk> football player 
 there have been <unk> that at long last changes may be in the works 
 the knight foundation of <unk> ohio has established a national commission to look into <unk> reform and the ncaa presidents commission earlier this month recommended cutting spring football practice in half moving the start of basketball practice back by a month and reducing maximum schedules in that sport to N games from N 
 the key word in that <unk> though is may 
 ncaa executive director richard <unk> in accepting a place on the knight commission urged that the panel take a balanced view which looks for all the world like a plea not to rock the boat too much and the presidents ' recommendations could face considerable opposition at the ncaa 's full convention in january which will vote on them 
 i read that one <unk> athletics director predicted that the <unk> proposal could fail because of real world <unk> economic considerations 
 but the real world also includes the <unk> truth that colleges are cheating the athletes they have <unk> and won 
 if they wo n't change their ways voluntarily maybe somebody bigger congress should make them 
 they want <unk> <unk> to the <unk> labs 
 they want a 24-hour library 
 and like college <unk> everywhere they are talking about a demonstration where protesters would gather quietly near the science building and raise their hands classroom style 
 such is the fiber of the <unk> that <unk> intellectuals let fly at <unk> of harvard university 's new society of <unk> and <unk> or song 
 <unk> are mad as <unk> about campus <unk> and they are n't going to take it anymore at least not without trying a few really neat ideas first 
 we could have called ourselves the academic intellectual society but then everyone would have said oh you mean the <unk> club <unk> <unk> song 's <unk> adviser told N <unk> at the club 's <unk> meeting earlier this month 
 membership has since swelled to between N and N 
 some people may think of <unk> as <unk> <unk> <unk> individuals with <unk> <unk> for their pencils and a <unk> with computers and matters <unk> 
 <unk> by at least one definition are <unk> circus <unk> 
 but song founder <unk> <unk> a harvard junior thinks of <unk> and <unk> more as <unk> <unk> with a <unk> <unk> 
 one of the group 's first projects is a <unk> hot line that students could call when they have an urge to delay studying 
 the club plans to show <unk> movies such as real <unk> in which physics <unk> pop corn with <unk> and naturally the <unk> of the <unk> a tale of college males with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> 
 one of its more ambitious goals is to get <unk> <unk> the los angeles high-school <unk> teacher featured in the film stand and deliver to come to harvard for a guest <unk> 
 <unk> and <unk> sometimes find themselves a bit isolated at harvard 
 so mr. <unk> says high priority is being given to creating a computerized <unk> service where instead of being matched for eye color you could be matched for similar intellectual interests 
 for instance 
 i 'm a <unk> major but i want to know about <unk> 
 hopefully i 'd find someone in <unk> who wanted to know more about <unk> 
 it could work 
 meanwhile finding a volunteer to write the computer program is n't a problem

 in the wake of the exxon <unk> spill in march new <unk> drilling bans are sharply <unk> exploration in promising locations offshore and in alaska 
 at the same time moves toward tighter <unk> standards are spurring interest in lighter or alternative fuels that do n't <unk> as much as fuel refined from heavy <unk> generally high in <unk> 
 over the years the world 's stream of oil has been growing heavier 
 so the scramble is on for lighter <unk> <unk> and for natural gas in the u.s. 
 recently saudi arabia and venezuela traditional <unk> producers have <unk> of new finds of light <unk> oil by their national oil companies 
 venezuela has also earmarked $ N million in new money for <unk> exploration 
 and some oil companies are trying to lock in future supplies 
 typical is <unk> <unk> <unk> italy 's state-owned energy company which not long ago acquired through its agip oil subsidiary a N N share in the consortium accounting for half of <unk> 's oil output

 as the soviet union <unk> with its worsening economy leading reformers have drawn up a blueprint for change designed to push the nation much closer to a free-market system 
 the proposals go far beyond the current and rather confused policies of perestroika mikhail gorbachev 's restructuring of the economy 
 they lay out a clear timetable and <unk> for <unk> the system of setting prices breaking up huge industrial monopolies and putting unprofitable state-owned companies out of business 
 they also address such <unk> subjects as the likelihood of unemployment and high inflation and recommend ways to soften the social consequences 
 while many solutions to the nation 's economic troubles are being discussed the blueprint is attracting widespread attention here because of its <unk> and presumed <unk> <unk> 
 although it was published <unk> in the latest edition of the weekly <unk> <unk> soviet sources say the article was written by <unk> <unk> and a small group of colleagues 
 mr. <unk> head of the academy of science 's institute of economics was recently appointed deputy chairman of the soviet government and head of a state commission on economic reform 
 it 's clearly a <unk> for the next stage of perestroika said one analyst 
 the economic ideas in the document are much <unk> than current policies 
 for example the proposed overhaul of prices an extremely sensitive political topic is far more precise than the vague plans announced by mr. gorbachev in N and later dropped 
 but the proposals also display political <unk> <unk> some of the most controversial ideas in cautious language so as not to <unk> powerful conservatives in the government who stand to lose out if they are implemented 
 seeking a middle path between opponents of change and <unk> who demand overnight solutions the article advocates what it calls a <unk> approach 
 the document is to be discussed at a conference of leading economists late this month and will probably be presented to the soviet parliament for consideration this year 
 as <unk> draw up proposals for the next five-year plan which starts in N the blueprint represents a powerful first shot in what is likely to be a fierce battle over economic reform 
 the authors make a gloomy assessment of the economy and concede that quick and easy <unk> to success simply do n't exist 
 instead they <unk> out a strategy in several <unk> from now until N 
 most of the measures would probably only start to have an effect on beleaguered soviet consumers in two to three years at the earliest 
 the key steps <unk> include property 
 rigid ideological restrictions on property ownership should be abandoned 
 the document proposes breaking up the <unk> system of state-owned enterprises and farms and allowing a big private sector to <unk> helped by tough <unk> legislation 
 the economy would be thrown open to numerous types of ownership between now and N including factories leased by workers or owned by shareholders cooperatives and joint ventures 
 some forms of private property would be <unk> 
 such moves would greatly reduce the power of government ministries who now <unk> guard their turf and are seen as one of the major obstacles blocking economic reform 
 finances 
 emergency measures would be introduced to ease the country 's financial crisis notably its $ N billion budget deficit 
 by the end of next year all <unk> state enterprises would be put out of business or handed over to workers who would buy or lease them or turn them into cooperatives 
 similar steps would be taken to liquidate unprofitable state and collective farms by the end of N 
 a unified system of taxation should be introduced rapidly 
 to <unk> up some of the N billion rubles in circulation the government should encourage home ownership including issuing bonds that guarantee holders the right to purchase an apartment 
 labor 
 a genuine market for labor and wages would replace the present rigid <unk> system 
 <unk> from decades of soviet <unk> the new system would lead to big differences in pay between workers and almost certainly to unemployment 
 to cushion the <unk> the government would introduce a minimum wage and unemployment benefits 
 prices 
 the entire system of <unk> set prices would be <unk> and free-market prices introduced for most wholesale trade and some retail trade 
 consumers would still be able to buy some food and household goods at subsidized prices but luxury and imported items including food would be sold at market prices 
 wholesale prices would be divided into three categories raw materials sold at fixed prices close to world levels <unk> procurement prices for a small number of key products and free prices for everything else to be determined by contracts between suppliers and purchasers 
 inflation-adjusted social benefits would ensure that the poor and elderly do n't suffer <unk> 
 foreign trade 
 the current <unk> and <unk> of foreign trade would be taken much further 
 soviet companies would face fewer obstacles for exports and could even invest their hard currency abroad 
 foreigners would receive greater incentives to invest in the u.s.s.r. 
 alongside the current <unk> ruble a second currency would be introduced that could be freely exchanged for dollars and other western currencies 
 a domestic foreign exchange market would be set up as part of an overhaul of the nation 's banking system 
 the blueprint is at its <unk> when referring to the fate of the two powerful economic institutions that seem likely to oppose such sweeping plans the state planning committee known as <unk> and the state committee for material supply or <unk> 
 but it hints strongly that both organizations would increasingly lose their clout as the changes particularly the introduction of wholesale trade and the breakup of state monopolies take effect 
 ready willing and unable i always lift the <unk> when my car does n't start if <unk> at home do n't work i <unk> take them apart

 albert engelken and robert thomson had never met though for N years their lives had been <unk> in a way <unk> to the sports world 
 mr. engelken now a <unk> executive in washington d.c. and mr. thomson a <unk> salesman in <unk> n.j. had n't even talked to each other 
 but one recent day they became much closer 
 mr. engelken a <unk> baseball fan <unk> over the sports pages to chart the <unk> of my favorite and <unk> teams and players 
 he often <unk> he says at the clutter of sports stories about drugs alcohol gambling and some player 's <unk> about the <unk> millions he is offered to play the game 
 his morning paper the washington post even carries a sports column called <unk> that <unk> the latest <unk> and convictions of players and team managers 
 like many sports <unk> mr. engelken has turned <unk> 
 but his is a story about a hero in an era of sports <unk> and about what <unk> ruth mr. engelken <unk> us once called the only real game in the world 
 to mr. engelken it is also a story about love because i 'm <unk> to have a wife who still thinks her slightly <unk> husband 's <unk> birthday deserves the ultimate present 
 to understand what mr. engelken means one must go back to a <unk> october afternoon in N at new york 's <unk> grounds stadium where it can be argued the most dramatic moment in baseball history was played out 
 it was the ninth inning of the third game of a <unk> <unk> between the brooklyn <unk> and the new york giants the predecessor to the san francisco giants scheduled to play in tonight 's world series 
 baseball fans throughout new york had <unk> out a long summer with their teams and now it had come to this a battle between the two for the national league <unk> down to the last inning of the last game no less 
 some N fans <unk> the stands and shouted at the top of their <unk> 
 mr. engelken was doing the same across the hudson river in new jersey where with his nose pressed against the front window of the <unk> national bank he watched the <unk> on a television set the bank set up for the event 
 the <unk> series had <unk> the <unk> giants fan 
 the giants struck first winning the <unk> N on a <unk> homer off <unk> <unk> ralph <unk> mr. engelken recalls with precision today 
 the giants got <unk> in the second game N and trailed N going into the bottom of the ninth of the third and deciding game 
 the giants scored once and had <unk> on second <unk> <unk> and third <unk> <unk> as bobby thomson advanced to the plate 
 the rest as they say is history 
 mr. thomson a tall <unk> <unk> <unk> stepped into the <unk> 's box 
 thomson took a called strike mr. engelken <unk> 
 the tension mounted as ralph <unk> again on the <unk> <unk> down the <unk> 
 he wound up and let loose a <unk> 
 the pitch <unk> toward bobby thomson high and inside and then with a crack of the bat was sent <unk> back into the lower <unk> stands 
 giants fans went into euphoria says mr. engelken 
 and bobby thomson was made a <unk> 
 the same bobby thomson it turns out who sells those <unk> today 
 there ca n't be an older baseball fan alive who does n't clearly remember that bobby thomson homer who ca n't tell you where he was when he heard the famous <unk> <unk> radio broadcast the one that concluded with mr. <unk> shouting over and over the giants win the <unk> the giants win the <unk> 
 mr. engelken and mr. thomson drifted in different <unk> in the subsequent years and the <unk> grounds located under <unk> 's <unk> in upper manhattan was replaced by a <unk> project 
 mr. thomson played <unk> and third base until N posting a lifetime N <unk> average and <unk> up N home runs before retiring and going into <unk> sales 
 mr. engelken moved south to washington but he took with him <unk> memories of the homer of N 
 when his wife <unk> came down the <unk> on their <unk> day in N mr. engelken no <unk> on the romantic front gave her the ultimate <unk> you look <unk> than bobby thomson 's home run 
 the couple 's first dog homer was named after the great event though <unk> friends assumed he was the <unk> of the <unk> 
 and when mr. engelken 's sister <unk> who was born two days before the home run reached her <unk> birthday mr. engelken wrote his sports hero to tell him of the <unk> of events 
 mr. thomson sent off a card to <unk> it does n't seem like N years since i hit that home run to <unk> your birth it read 
 <unk> was pleased but nowhere near as much as mr. engelken 
 the family license plate reads <unk> N the first three letters of the family name and no surprise here bobby thomson 's uniform number 
 and on mr. engelken 's <unk> birthday his wife bought a book detailing the big homer and sent it off to mr. thomson to be <unk> 
 what could have been better asks mr. engelken 
 <unk> engelken asked the same question earlier this year when her husband was about to turn N 
 she had an idea 
 on her husband 's <unk> birthday after an <unk> N years of marriage it should be noted <unk> al and their <unk> son set out for new york to visit <unk> university 
 mrs. engelken had scheduled a stop on the new jersey turnpike to she told her husband pick up some papers for a neighbor 
 the papers would be handed over at a bank of telephone <unk> just off exit N 
 it sounded like something out of ian fleming mr. engelken recalls 
 at the appointed exit the family pulled over and mrs. engelken went to get her papers 
 mr. engelken turned off the motor and rolled down the window 
 in a matter of minutes she was back with a tall <unk> man in <unk> 
 she <unk> down by the car window and addressed her husband with her favorite <unk> 
 <unk> she said happy <unk> birthday 
 this is bobby thomson 
 and there he was recalls mr. engelken 
 the hero of my youth the one person in history i 'd most like to meet 
 keep your thomas <unk> or st. <unk> or <unk> i 'd take baseball 's flying <unk> without <unk> 
 they talked of the home run 
 i thought it was in the upper deck said bobby thomson now N years old 
 they talked of the aftermath 
 i never thought it would become so <unk> bobby <unk> 
 mr. engelken says his wife was <unk> by the whole thing 
 it was worth it just for the look on albert 's face 
 the two men spent an hour at exit N <unk> the event <unk> the <unk> dream of a young boy now turned N mr. engelken says 
 his hero signed photographs of the homer and <unk> called ralph <unk> a very fine <unk> 
 and when mr. engelken asked him why he took time off from work for somebody he did n't even know bobby thomson replied you know albert if you have the chance in life to make somebody this happy you have an obligation to do it 
 in an interview mr. thomson who is married and has three grown children says he has few ties to baseball these days other than playing <unk> games now and again 
 but his fans to his constant <unk> never let him forget the famous <unk> 
 his mail regularly recalls my one event and has been growing in recent years 
 in response to the letters mr. thomson usually sends an <unk> photo with a <unk> note and rarely <unk> a <unk> 
 but when <unk> engelken wrote him saying she could stop near his new jersey home it seemed different 
 what a good feeling it would be for me to do that he says he thought 
 when the engelken family got back from its trip up north mr. engelken wrote it all down just to make sure no detail was missed 
 on the way home his notes recall it took concentrated effort to keep that car pointed south 
 my mind was miles north at a place called <unk> 's <unk> where a real sports hero had captured the <unk> of a kid who never fully grew up and is all the richer for it 
 take heart sports fans he wrote 
 real heroes exist 
 you might not find one in the <unk> column 
 but who knows 
 you might meet up with him at that bank of telephone <unk> just off exit N of the new jersey turnpike 
 southam inc. said its unprofitable weekly newspaper the financial times of canada is up for sale 
 analysts said the announcement the latest in a series of <unk> and restructuring moves is aimed at improving southam 's earnings before the expiration in june of a standstill pact with <unk> corp 
 when that agreement expires <unk> will be free to increase its N N stake in southam or to make an offer for the whole company 
 <unk> of the southam family hold an additional N N stake in the toronto-based company canada 's largest newspaper publisher 
 the newspaper could fetch between N million and N million canadian dollars us$ N million to $ N million said one analyst who asked not to be identified 
 a spokesman for southam declined to comment on the price the company is seeking or on estimates of the paper 's annual losses which most analysts place at between c$ N million and c$ N million 
 yesterday southam reported third-quarter earnings of c$ N million on revenue of c$ N million down from c$ N million on revenue of c$ N million in the year-ago quarter 
 to be profitable the paper requires more circulation and building circulation is an expensive undertaking said john <unk> the paper 's publisher 
 southam said the level of future investment required by the paper would have restricted its options in other areas 
 the acquisition of the financial times of canada is well within reach for any number of media companies both public and private said james <unk> an analyst with toronto-based <unk> james capel inc 
 possible bidders include christopher <unk> a toronto financier and vice chairman of hees international bancorp inc. a holding company controlled by toronto 's bronfman family 
 mr. <unk> sold his stake in <unk> corp. to hees earlier this year and is said to be seeking a media acquisition 
 mr. <unk> could n't be reached for comment but roy <unk> chairman of <unk> media a closely held concern that publishes two business magazines said his company would take a close look at the newspaper 
 mr. <unk> said the sale of the <unk> financial times which southam has owned since N is consistent with southam 's strategy of cutting costs to obtain maximum profits from its operations while <unk> of <unk> <unk> assets 
 southam agreed to sell its N N stake in <unk> communications ltd. a broadcasting concern to <unk> hunter ltd. for about c$ N million last year 
 this year it has moved to cut costs in its newspaper division through layoffs and asset sales while reaching joint venture and acquisition agreements in other areas 
 the financial times of canada has no links to the british daily newspaper the financial times

 the company had a tax credit of $ N million 
 in the year-earlier quarter the tax credit was $ N million 
 sales rose N N to $ N million from $ N million 
 operating profit in the company 's <unk> segment rose N N while operating profit in the engineering materials segment rose N N 
 however the company 's petroleum services segment while profitable was hurt by high financing costs associated with the company 's buy-out of a N N stake in eastman <unk> co. from texas eastern corp. last june 
 norton and texas eastern had each held a N N stake in eastman in a joint venture 
 norton announced earlier this month that it was exploring the possible sale of all or part of eastman <unk>

 for the government it has become a highly volatile political issue 
 last may a government panel released a report on the extent and causes of the problem 
 during the past N years the report showed housing prices increased nearly <unk> 
 the report laid the blame on speculators who it said had pushed land prices up <unk> 
 the panel found that since N real-estate prices rose nearly N N in a speculative fever fueled by economic prosperity the N seoul olympics and the government 's pledge to rapidly develop korea 's southwest 
 the result is that those rich enough to own any real estate at all have boosted their holdings substantially 
 for those with no holdings the prospects of buying a home are ever <unk> 
 in N a quarter of the population owned N N of the nation 's N square <unk> of private land the report said and N N of the population owned N N of the land devoted to housing 
 meanwhile the government 's land bureau reports that only about a third of korean families own their own homes 
 <unk> have soared along with house prices 
 former national <unk> hong <unk> now a radio <unk> says the problem is <unk> for many people 
 i 'm afraid of a popular <unk> if this situation is n't corrected he adds 
 in fact during the past three months there have been several demonstrations at the office complex where the land bureau is <unk> and at the national assembly demanding the government put a stop to real-estate speculation 
 president roh <unk> woo 's administration has been studying the real-estate crisis for the past year with an eye to partial land <unk> 
 last week the government took three bills to the national assembly 
 the proposed legislation is aimed at <unk> some of the <unk> in the current <unk> system 
 <unk> of the bills as currently <unk> are a restriction on the amount of real estate one family can own to N square <unk> in the nation 's six largest cities but more in smaller cities and rural areas 
 the government will <unk> offenders but wo n't <unk> property 
 a tax of between N N and N N on property holdings that exceed the <unk> ceiling 
 taxes of between N N and N N a year on excessive profits from the resale of property or the sale of idle land to the government 
 the government <unk> excessive profits as those above the average realized for other <unk> properties in an area 
 grace periods ranging from two to five years before the full scope of the penalties takes effect 
 the administration says the measures would stem rampant property speculation free more land for the government 's ambitious <unk> program designed to build two million apartments by N and perhaps boost the popular standing of president roh 
 but opposition legislators and others calling for help for south korea 's <unk> say the proposed changes do n't go far enough to make it possible for ordinary people to buy a home 
 some want lower limits on house <unk> others insist on <unk> higher taxation for larger homes and lots 
 the citizens coalition for economic justice a <unk> group leading the charge for radical reform wants restrictions on <unk> high taxation of capital gains and drastic revamping of the <unk> system on which property taxes are based 
 but others large <unk> real-estate developers and business leaders say the government 's proposals are <unk> 
 led by the federation of korean industries the critics are lobbying for the government to weaken its proposed restrictions and penalties 
 government officials who are urging real-estate reforms <unk> at the arguments of business leaders and <unk> at their pressure 
 there is no violation of the <unk> principle of private property in what we are doing says lee <unk> <unk> director of the government 's land bureau which drafted the bills 
 but he adds the constitution <unk> the government to impose some controls to <unk> the shortage of land 
 the land available for housing construction stands at about N square <unk> a person N N lower than in taiwan and only about half that of japan 
 mr. lee estimates that about N property speculators are operating in south korea 
 the chief <unk> he says are big companies and business groups that buy huge amounts of land not for their corporate use but for resale at huge profit 
 one research institute calculated that as much as N N of <unk> land is held by N companies and that as little as N N of that is used for business 
 the government 's office of bank supervision and examination told the national assembly this month that in the first half of N the nation 's N largest business groups bought real estate valued at $ N billion 
 the ministry of finance as a result has proposed a series of measures that would restrict business investment in real estate even more tightly than restrictions aimed at individuals 
 under those measures financial institutions would be restricted from owning any more real estate than they need for their business operations 
 banks investment and credit firms would be permitted to own land equivalent in value to N N of their capital currently the proportion is N N 
 the maximum <unk> property holdings for insurance companies would be reduced to N N of their total asset value down from N N currently 
 but mrs. park acknowledges that even if the policies work to slow or stop speculation apartment prices are unlikely to go down 
 at best she <unk> they will rise more slowly more slowly she hopes than her family 's income

 the justice department said it is seeking to join a private lawsuit challenging a pittsburgh suburb 's <unk> ordinance that sharply restricts the locations available to group homes for the handicapped 
 this would be the department 's first suit challenging a local <unk> ordinance under N amendments to the fair housing act 
 under those amendments which took effect in march of this year the federal government can intervene in private <unk> lawsuits 
 the ordinance in moon township prohibits <unk> a group home for the handicapped within a mile of another such facility 
 in papers filed with the federal district court in pittsburgh the justice department alleged that the ordinance by limiting the number of group homes that can be established in the township makes housing unavailable on account of <unk> 
 the private suit was brought by three <unk> <unk> people who live in a group home in moon 
 <unk> smith moon township manager said the ordinance is intended to prevent the concentration of group homes for the <unk> <unk> from changing the character and flavor of the neighborhood 
 he said the ordinance also will benefit the <unk> <unk> 
 our intent is to spread them out to insure they are well integrated into the community he said 
 energetic and concrete action has been taken in colombia during the past N days against the <unk> of the drug trade but it has not been sufficiently effective because unfortunately it came too late 
 ten years ago the newspaper el espectador of which my brother <unk> was editor began warning of the rise of the drug <unk> and of their leaders ' aspirations to control colombian politics especially the congress 
 then when it would have been easier to resist them nothing was done and my brother was murdered by the drug <unk> three years ago 
 the most <unk> <unk> have not <unk> their press more <unk> than the drug <unk> <unk> colombia 's 
 the censorship is <unk> through terrorism and assassination 
 in the past N years about N journalists have been <unk> forever murdered 
 within the past two months a bomb exploded in the offices of the el espectador in <unk> destroying a major part of its installations and equipment 
 and only last week the newspaper <unk> liberal in the city of <unk> was <unk> and its installations destroyed 
 journalists and their families are constantly threatened as are the newspaper distribution outlets 
 distribution centers are <unk> and advertisers are <unk> 
 censorship is imposed by terrorism 
 if the colombian media accept this new and <unk> censorship there is little doubt that the drug mafia 's terrorism someday will extend to all the newspapers published in the free world 
 the solidarity of the <unk> media world-wide against drug terrorism is the only way press freedom can survive 
 the american people and their government also <unk> up too late to the <unk> drugs posed to the moral structure of their country 
 even now the american attack upon this tremendous problem is <unk> in <unk> to the magnitude of the threat 
 i can <unk> that a recent colombian <unk> to the u.s. was offered drugs three times in the few blocks ' walk between grand central terminal and the <unk> <unk> hotel in <unk> manhattan 
 colombia alone its government its people its newspapers does not have the capacity to fight this battle successfully 
 all <unk> countries must jointly decide to combat and punish the consumers and distributors of drugs 
 the u.s. as the major drug consumer should lead this joint effort 
 reduction if not the total <unk> of drug consumption is the requirement for victory 
 much is being done in colombia to fight the drug <unk> mafia 
 <unk> homes and <unk> have been <unk> by the military authorities and sophisticated and powerful communications equipment have been seized 
 more than N planes and <unk> have been <unk> at airports and a large number of vehicles and <unk> has been confiscated 
 the military has also captured enormous <unk> of powerful and sophisticated weapons <unk> and other <unk> <unk> 
 much has been accomplished and public opinion <unk> supports the government and the army but on the other hand none of the key drug <unk> have been captured 
 there has been a lot of talk that a large portion of the colombian economy is sustained by the laundering of drug money 
 in my opinion this is not true 
 <unk> drug money has served only to increase <unk> the price of real estate creating serious problems for low-income people who <unk> to own their own homes 
 drug money has also gone to buy expensive cars airplanes <unk> and <unk> where drugs are consumed 
 but most of the drug money is kept in investments and in financial institutions outside colombia 
 in fact the cooperation of those financial institutions is essential to the success of the drug battle 
 what is of much more importance to the colombian economy than the supposed benefits of <unk> drug money is higher prices for colombia 's legitimate products 
 the price of coffee has gone down almost N N since the beginning of the year to the lowest level after inflation since the great depression 
 market conditions point to even lower prices next year 
 the <unk> coffee <unk> had to be formally <unk> this summer 
 as a result colombia will earn $ N million less from its coffee this year than last 
 our coffee growers face reductions in their income and this <unk> them to <unk> <unk> <unk> crops for coffee 
 u.s. interests occasionally try to impose barriers to the import of another important colombian export cut flowers into the american market 
 a just price and an open market for what colombian produces and exports should be the policy of the u.s. 
 i take advantage of this opportunity given to me by the wall street journal to make a plea to the millions of readers of this newspaper to become soldiers dedicated to the fight against the use of drugs 
 each <unk> of cocaine consumed is a deadly bullet against those in our country and in the rest of the world who fight this terrible <unk> 
 a crusade of no to the consumption of drugs is <unk> 
 mr. <unk> is president of el espectador a newspaper founded by his <unk> 
 it has more drug users than boston has people 
 <unk> thousand of its children live in foster homes while N residents have no homes at all 
 its tax base is shrinking a $ N billion budget deficit looms and the city faces contract negotiations with all major municipal unions next year 
 this is new york city 
 when the dust and <unk> settle in an <unk> mayoral race the man most likely to gain custody of all this is a career politician named david dinkins 
 running the nation 's largest and most <unk> city may be no treat but at least mr. dinkins knows what to expect from it 
 as the campaign hits the home stretch however voters still have very little idea what they can expect from him 
 after N years in city politics david dinkins remains an <unk> 
 the <unk> <unk> manhattan borough president the first black man to win the democratic nomination for mayor here does n't have a single prominent political enemy 
 while he is widely described as a man with deep convictions he has few major political programs that he can call his own 
 asked about his greatest achievement in public life he first speaks about the quality of his staff 
 now as election day <unk> even some supporters wonder what he will do if he wins the <unk> on nov. N 
 they wonder whether he can be firm with his longtime allies including union leaders and political <unk> who may seek a place at the trough 
 they wonder whether he has the economic know-how to steer the city through a possible fiscal crisis and they wonder who will be advising him 
 will he if he wins be in the <unk> of the most liberal of his allies who advocate such policies as rent control for commercial buildings or will he tilt toward the real-estate interests that have <unk> money into his campaign 
 after his decisive primary victory over mayor edward i. koch in september mr. dinkins <unk> until recently on a <unk> lead over his republican opponent rudolph giuliani the former crime <unk> who has proved a something of a <unk> as a candidate 
 but mr. dinkins has <unk> in the past two weeks over his campaign 's payments to a black activist who is a convicted <unk> and over his handling of a stock sale to his son 
 polls also have recorded some <unk> in mr. dinkins 's support among jewish voters and <unk> projections now put his lead at between four and N percentage points 
 in an interview with reporters and editors of the wall street journal mr. dinkins appears quite confident of victory and of his ability to handle the <unk> 
 a lot of people think i will give away the store but i can assure you i will not he says 
 i am aware we have real budgetary problems 
 the city is full of aging bridges water <unk> and roadways that are in need of billions of dollars worth of repair 
 renewed efforts to fight drugs and crime will be costly 
 but city officials say tax revenues are lagging 
 and after a decade of explosive job growth on wall street a period of <unk> is under way 
 mr. koch already has announced he will drop N jobs from the city payroll but that wo n't be enough 
 new york state comptroller edward <unk> predicts a $ N billion budget gap for the city 's next fiscal year a gap that could grow if there is a recession 
 if elected mr. dinkins will probably have no choice but to raise taxes on <unk> businesses or cut spending in already <unk> neighborhoods 
 he is going to face a mess says city council president andrew stein 
 his supporters are not <unk> but their solution to everything will be to spend more money and he wo n't have any money 
 by and large mr. dinkins has <unk> the touchy question of whose <unk> he would <unk> 
 instead of focusing on the financial future mr. dinkins has sold himself as a <unk> for a city recently touched by racial violence and as a <unk> <unk> to N years of <unk> generated by mayor koch 
 the thing about the dinkins <unk> is that it offers hope to a broad range of people says <unk> <unk> a real-estate executive and former aide to gov. mario <unk> 
 it is a <unk> <unk> 
 no doubt mr. dinkins has been a <unk> influence 
 he is an <unk> figure who <unk> the <unk> of colleagues ' children opens doors for women and almost never has a bad word to say about anybody 
 more important he emerged as a <unk> last summer after the central park rape of a white <unk> in which a group of <unk> <unk> was charged and the racial murder of a black <unk> in the white brooklyn neighborhood of <unk> 
 rather than scaring off white voters as many predicted he would mr. dinkins attracted many whites precisely because of his reputation for having a cool head 
 keeping cool is a dinkins priority on <unk> days this summer he was known to change his <unk> suits as many as four times a day 
 but even in his <unk> campaign he has shown signs of the <unk> and confusion that some say has plagued his tenure as manhattan borough president and might <unk> him as mayor 
 over the last few weeks he has <unk> away roughly half of what was once a <unk> lead in the polls over mr. giuliani 
 a story about how he <unk> the sale to his son of his stock in a media company controlled by his political <unk> <unk> sutton was allowed to <unk> a full week before mr. dinkins faced the media 
 he has canceled numerous campaign appointments and was largely <unk> to the media until the stock story broke 
 his campaign was caught <unk> amid allegations it paid almost $ N for what it said was a <unk> effort by black activist <unk> carson a convicted <unk> who later said publicly that he is <unk> 
 critics have said the payment looked like an attempt by the dinkins camp to get mr. carson to stop leading <unk> demonstrations <unk> the <unk> murder protests the campaign may have feared could cause some white voters to turn from a black candidate 
 mr. dinkins also has failed to <unk> jewish voters ' fears about his association with the rev. <unk> jackson despite the fact that few local <unk> politicians have been as <unk> for jewish causes in the past N years as mr. dinkins has 
 these campaign problems have <unk> difficulties mr. dinkins has run into before 
 a former u.s. marine mr. dinkins got off to a quick start in politics joining a local democratic political club in the 1950s linking up with black urban leaders such as charles <unk> <unk> paterson and mr. sutton and getting himself elected to the state assembly in N 
 but his chance to become deputy mayor under mayor <unk> <unk> a plan boosted by mr. sutton was <unk> because of mr. dinkins 's failure still largely <unk> to file income tax returns for four years running 
 i always thought of this as a thing that could always be done tomorrow he said at the time 
 later mr. dinkins became more deeply <unk> to mr. sutton and other city <unk> including <unk> council president paul <unk> when they helped him get appointed city clerk a largely <unk> post responsible for the city 's marriage bureau among other things 
 mr. <unk> is now one of the lawyers for mr. sutton 's media company 
 the debt rose further in N when mr. sutton resigned his position as manhattan borough president to run for mayor 
 mr. sutton recalls when i left i sat down with charlie <unk> <unk> paterson and david and david said who will run for borough president and i said you will 
 david <unk> mayor koch 's longtime media adviser says of mr. dinkins he really is the <unk> of the <unk> system 
 but the guy is so personally decent people tend to forget that 
 mr. dinkins lost twice by wide margins before finally getting elected borough president in N 
 but by most accounts he made little of the post and was best known among city politicians for his problems making up his mind on matters before the city 's board of estimate the body that votes on crucial budget and <unk> matters 
 colleagues today recall with some humor how meetings would <unk> into the early morning hours as mr. dinkins would march his staff out of board meetings and into his private office to discuss en <unk> certain controversial proposals 
 he taught me how to drink <unk> tea instead of coffee at N a.m. i 'll give him that says deputy mayor robert <unk> 
 often mr. dinkins 's <unk> prevented him from having a say in the way things turned out critics claim 
 on the campaign <unk> he often points out that he was the only board of estimate member to vote against a controversial real-estate project at manhattan 's columbus circle 
 but board members say he took so long to decide how to vote that by the time he decided it was too late to try to draw other members to his position 
 says one city official everybody else had brought in the <unk> and made their deal 
 he would have got a lot more done if he made up his mind faster 
 one board member bronx borough president ferdinand <unk> was said to be so <unk> with mr. dinkins 's behavior at many meetings that he withheld his support for mr. dinkins 's mayoral effort until late in the primary campaign 
 i had some problem from time to time on the length of time he would take to make up his mind mr. <unk> admits but he maintains that he did n't delay his support of mr. dinkins and that he backs the democratic candidate <unk> 
 mr. dinkins 's campaign manager and former chief of staff bill lynch denies that the manhattan borough president has taken too long to decide important issues 
 we did n't <unk> everything that came to us mr. lynch says 
 on some occasions when mr. dinkins has discussed the issues during the campaign he has run into a familiar kind of trouble 
 some supporters were stunned this summer when mr. dinkins suggested weakening the law <unk> public employees to go on strike 
 he withdrew the remark 
 when he later <unk> with striking hospital workers some allies <unk> a little more concerned that mr. dinkins was setting the wrong tone for coming contract negotiations with city employees 
 then two days before receiving an endorsement from environmental groups mr. dinkins promised he would issue a three-year <unk> on construction of <unk> plants 
 that announcement was <unk> criticized by mayor koch who has endorsed mr. dinkins because the city faces a garbage crisis and has already spent $ N million planning for an incinerator that would be scrapped under mr. dinkins 's proposal 
 while his public statements have at times been confusing mr. dinkins 's position papers have more consistently reflected <unk> sentiment 
 he favors a form of commercial rent control which the financial community believes would make it more difficult to attract investment in the city 
 in the midst of a labor shortage he proposes linking city subsidies to businesses to their record of hiring new york city residents 
 with an <unk> local labor pool many experts believe that policy could drive businesses from the city 
 and he favors a more cooperative approach toward the neighboring states of new jersey and connecticut in the battle over companies thinking of moving employees out of new york city 
 many <unk> officials say the koch administration 's aggressive approach helped save N chase manhattan bank jobs from moving across the hudson 
 but mr. dinkins 's economic <unk> do n't seem to bother the business community where he draws significant support 
 steven <unk> president of the real estate board of new york an industry organization says mr. dinkins 's economic development program is <unk> but when it comes down to it he can be reasonable 
 mr. dinkins 's inner circle of advisers appears to include both <unk> and <unk> leaving voters with little clue as to who will be more influential 
 the key man seems to be the campaign manager mr. lynch 
 a <unk> <unk> son of a long island potato farmer mr. lynch is a veteran union <unk> who worked on the presidential campaigns of sen. edward kennedy and mr. jackson 
 but as the dinkins campaign hit tough times this month andrew <unk> the politically <unk> son of the new york governor is also said to have taken a more active role on strategy 
 another close ally is ruth <unk> a manhattan city <unk> some of whose programs such as commercial rent control have made their way into mr. dinkins 's position papers 
 if she remains influential with mr. dinkins as some suggest she will his <unk> may take on a more <unk> flavor 
 but lincoln center president nathan leventhal who would head a dinkins transition team is more mainstream as is real-estate executive anthony <unk> another insider 
 mr. dinkins also has said he would receive economic advice from a board that would include american express co. chairman james d. robinson iii investment banker <unk> <unk> <unk> specialist <unk> lewis and attorney joseph flom 
 some business leaders and others also believe that mr. dinkins would place significant responsibility in the hands of a deputy mayor with a strong administrative background 
 names of possible deputies that have surfaced include former mayoral candidate richard <unk> former schools chancellor frank <unk> and messrs. leventhal and <unk> 
 then there are mr. dinkins 's <unk> <unk> colleagues such as u.s. rep. <unk> former deputy mayor paterson and mr. sutton 
 having <unk> positions of real influence or wealth these men constitute the old guard of new york city black politics they are less <unk> than the younger more activist black political community that has been based largely in brooklyn 
 part of mr. dinkins 's strength is his ability to win the support of both the brooklyn and <unk> <unk> 
 we know there are <unk> for the city out there says mr. paterson mr. dinkins 's former law partner 
 if any of us think we 're going to <unk> david 's determination to be the best possible mayor because of his obligations to us we are making a sad mistake 
 adds ms. <unk> who is expected to win the borough president 's job mr. dinkins is <unk> you have to remember david is a <unk> 
 but mr. dinkins 's sense of <unk> often comes across more as an insider 's determination not to upset the political apple <unk> 
 he is taken <unk> in an interview when asked whether as mayor he plans on <unk> the political <unk> that <unk> the <unk> <unk> of new york 's school system 
 i will sit down and talk some of the problems out but take on the political system <unk> he says with a shake of the head 
 despite many doubts about his <unk> white new <unk> who gave mr. dinkins N N of their votes in the primary are n't expected to desert in sufficient numbers to turn the election to mr. giuliani 
 the former u.s. attorney who prosecuted targets ranging from mafia <unk> to wall street executives has succeeded in raising questions about mr. dinkins 's ethical standards but so far has failed to generate excitement about his own <unk> 
 as a republican in an <unk> democratic city mr. giuliani has an inherent <unk> 
 as a first-time candidate he has been slow to learn the <unk> of new york city <unk> 
 mr. giuliani is finding that mr. dinkins in his many years in public life has built up considerable good will that so far has led many voters to <unk> certain <unk> 
 the bottom line is that he is a very genuine and decent guy says malcolm <unk> a jewish community leader 
 in the end i think david will be <unk> for being david 
 <unk> johnson pulls a tape measure across the front of what was once a <unk> <unk> home 
 a deep <unk> now runs along its north wall exposed when the house <unk> two feet off its foundation during last week 's earthquake 
 a side <unk> was <unk> away 
 the <unk> is a pile of bricks on the front lawn 
 the remainder of the house <unk> <unk> against a <unk> oak tree 
 the <unk> <unk> ms. johnson dressed in jeans and a <unk> as she <unk> through the steady afternoon rain is a claims adjuster with aetna life & casualty 
 she has been on the move almost <unk> since last thursday when an army of adjusters employed by major insurers <unk> the san francisco area to help policyholders <unk> through the rubble and restore some order to their lives 
 equipped with cellular telephones laptop computers <unk> and a pack of blank checks they parcel out money so their clients can find temporary living quarters buy food replace lost clothing repair broken water <unk> and <unk> walls 
 some of the funds will used to <unk> unstable buildings and clear sites for future construction 
 many adjusters are authorized to write checks for amounts up to $ N on the spot 
 they do n't <unk> at writing them 
 that 's my job get policyholders what they 're entitled to says bill schaeffer a claims supervisor who flew in from aetna 's <unk> conn. office 
 the <unk> house that ms. johnson is <unk> has been deemed <unk> by town officials 
 but she asks a <unk> <unk> the bricks from the lawn to give her a boost through an open <unk> window 
 once inside she spends nearly four hours measuring and <unk> each room in the <unk> house gathering enough information to estimate what it would cost to rebuild it 
 she <unk> photos of the <unk> floors and the <unk> that has fallen away from the walls 
 while she works inside a <unk> returns with several friends to collect furniture and clothing 
 one of the friends <unk> broken <unk> and shattered glass from a <unk> and starts to pack what can be <unk> from the kitchen 
 others grab books records photo <unk> <unk> and chairs working <unk> in the fear that an <unk> will jolt the house again 
 the owners william and <unk> hammack are <unk> than many others 
 a few years ago mrs. hammack insisted on buying earthquake insurance for this house which had been converted into apartments 
 only about N N of california home and business owners carried earthquake coverage 
 the <unk> ' own home also in los <unk> suffered <unk> minor damage 
 ms. johnson who works out of aetna 's office in <unk> creek an east bay suburb is <unk> by the earthquake 's <unk> force 
 it really brings you down to a human level she says 
 it 's hard to accept all the suffering people are going through but you have to 
 if you do n't you ca n't do your job 
 for aetna and other insurers the san francisco earthquake hit when resources in the field already were stretched 
 most companies still are trying to sort through the <unk> caused by hurricane hugo in the carolinas last month 
 aetna which has nearly N adjusters had deployed about N of them in charlotte columbia and charleston 
 adjusters who had been working on the east coast say the insurer will still be processing claims from that storm through december 
 it could take six to nine months to handle the earthquake-related claims 
 when the earthquake rocked northern california last week aetna senior claims executives from the san francisco area were at the company 's hartford conn. headquarters for additional training on how to handle major catastrophes including earthquakes 
 since commercial airline flights were disrupted the company chartered three planes to fly these executives back to the west coast and bring along portable computers cellular phones and some claims adjusters 
 because of the difficulty of assessing the damages caused by the earthquake aetna pulled together a team of its most experienced claims adjusters from around the country 
 even so few had ever dealt with an earthquake 
 some adjusters like alan singer of san diego had been working in charleston for nearly four weeks 
 he returned home last thursday packed a bag with fresh clothes and reported for duty friday in <unk> creek 
 offices were set up in san francisco and san jose 
 in a few <unk> aetna knew it would probably be <unk> out big <unk> even before a client called or <unk> in a claim 
 for example officials at <unk> creek office learned that the <unk> hotel near the san francisco airport which is insured by aetna was badly damaged when they saw it on network television news 
 the secret to being a good adjuster is counting says <unk> <unk> an aetna adjuster from santa ana 
 you have to count everything 
 adjusters must count the number of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> 
 but they must also <unk> a price to each of these items as well as to floors <unk> <unk> and <unk> to come up with a total value for a house 
 to do that they must think in terms of <unk> by the square foot carpeting by the square yard <unk> by the roll <unk> by the linear foot 
 using a <unk> and a <unk> guide for such jobs as painting plumbing and <unk> in each major region of the country adjusters can figure out the value of a home in today 's market and what it would cost to rebuild it 
 sometimes repairs are out of the question 
 when aetna adjuster bill schaeffer visited a retired couple in oakland last thursday he found them living in a mobile home <unk> in front of their yard 
 the house itself located about N yards from the collapsed section of <unk> highway interstate N was pushed about four feet off its foundation and then collapsed into its <unk> 
 the next day mr. schaeffer presented the couple with a check for $ N to help them build a new home in the same neighborhood 
 he also is working with a real-estate agent to help find them an apartment to rent while their home is being built 
 many of the adjusters employed by aetna and other insurers have some experience with construction work or <unk> 
 but such skills were <unk> to <unk> johnson 
 four years ago she was managing a <unk> shop and was totally <unk> 
 a friend mentioned that she might want to look into a position at aetna if she was interested in a job that would constantly challenge her 
 she signed up starting as an inside adjuster who <unk> minor claims and does a lot of work by phone 
 a year later she moved to the commercial property claims division 
 she spent a month at an aetna school in <unk> pa. learning all about the construction trade including <unk> plumbing and electrical <unk> 
 that was followed by three months at the aetna institute in hartford where she was <unk> in learning how to read and interpret policies 
 her new line of work has some <unk> 
 recently a contractor saved her from falling three stories as she investigated what remained of an old <unk> house <unk> by an <unk> 
 i owe that contractor 
 i really do she says 
 as ms. johnson stands outside the hammack house after <unk> up her chores there the house begins to <unk> and <unk> 
 the ground <unk> <unk> her 
 it is an <unk> one of about N since the earthquake and it makes her uneasy 
 the next day as she prepares a $ N check for the <unk> which will cover the cost of <unk> the house and clearing away the debris she <unk> at the <unk> noise 
 on further reflection she admits that <unk> inside the <unk> ' house the previous day was n't such a great idea 
 during her second meeting with the <unk> ms. johnson reviews exactly what their policy covers 
 they would like to retrieve some appliances on the second floor but wonder if it 's safe to venture inside 
 ms. johnson tells them that if the appliances ca n't be <unk> their policy covers the replacement cost 
 mr. hammack is eager to know what aetna will pay for the house which has to come down 
 when will i get that check for a million dollars he jokes 
 the adjuster had n't completed all the calculations but says we 're talking policy limits 
 in this case that 's about $ N 
 it suddenly <unk> on mr. hammack that rebuilding the house in los <unk> an affluent community in santa clara county may cost more than aetna 's policy will pay 
 we can lose money on this he says 
 and you did n't want me to buy earthquake insurance says mrs. hammack reaching across the table and gently <unk> his hand 
 earthquake insurance costs about $ N to $ N annually for every $ N of value and high <unk> mean it generally pays only when there is a catastrophe 
 so many californians believe they can get by without it 
 even ms. johnson herself made that assumption 
 i always knew that the big one was coming but not during my lifetime she says 
 now she says she 's thinking of <unk> her own insurance agent 
 for ms. johnson dealing with the earthquake has been more than just a work experience 
 she lives in oakland a community hit hard by the earthquake 
 she did n't have hot water for five days 
 the apartment she shares with a <unk> daughter and her sister was rattled books and crystal hit the floor but nothing was severely damaged 
 her sister cynthia wishes <unk> had a different job 
 we worry about her out there cynthia says 
 last sunday ms. johnson finally got a chance to water her plants but stopped abruptly 
 i realized i could n't waste this water when there are people in <unk> who do n't have fresh water to drink 
 she has n't played any music since the earthquake hit out of respect for those who died on interstate N where the roadway collapsed 
 the federal communications commission allowed american telephone & telegraph co. to continue offering discount phone services for <unk> customers and said it would soon <unk> its regulation of the long-distance market 
 the fcc moves were good news for at&t which has been <unk> since the breakup of the phone system for greater <unk> in pricing and reduced regulation 
 alfred <unk> the new fcc chairman <unk> deregulation of at&t at his last job as head of a commerce department telecommunications agency 
 but it has been an open question whether mr. <unk> an extraordinarily cautious man would continue pushing deregulation at the fcc in the face of what is likely to be great political pressure 
 it means that <unk> is serious about the deregulation of long distance said jack <unk> a telecommunications analyst at painewebber inc. who attended the fcc meeting 
 all the commissioners were in amazing agreement to <unk> regulation for only having been together for a few months 
 the fcc took three specific actions regarding at&t 
 by a N vote it allowed at&t to continue offering special discount packages to big customers called tariff N rejecting appeals by at&t competitors that the discounts were illegal 
 then by a separate N vote it chose the <unk> possible grounds to strike down a different discount plan called tariff N that at&t offered to holiday corp 
 at&t gave a N N to N N discount to the memphis tenn. company that oversees holiday <unk> in response to a similar discount offered to holiday corp. by mci communications corp 
 the agency said that because mci 's offer had expired at&t could n't continue to offer its discount plan 
 but the agency specifically did n't rule whether at&t had the right to match offers by competitors if that means giving discounts not generally available to other phone users 
 indeed joe <unk> at&t 's vice president for <unk> services said at&t offered a similar tariff N discount to resort <unk> international of indianapolis to meet another mci bid 
 the fcc did n't say i could n't do it again he said 
 apart from those two actions mr. <unk> and the three other commissioners said they expect to <unk> how at&t is regulated since competition has increased 
 richard <unk> chief of the fcc 's <unk> bureau said he expected the agency to propose new rules next year 
 at&t <unk> the fcc 's actions 
 the time is long overdue to take a look at the fierce competition in the long-distance business and the rules governing it the new york telecommunications firm said in a statement 
 but mci of washington was <unk> with the fcc decision concerning tariff N arguing that at&t can not be allowed to <unk> fcc rules 
 united telecommunications inc. 's us <unk> unit said it was obviously disappointed with the fcc decision on tariff N 
 us <unk> said was it will petition the fcc decision in federal court 
 we believe that the court will find it unlawful said a us <unk> spokesman 
 separately at&t filed a <unk> against mci <unk> it of misleading consumers through allegedly false and deceptive advertising 
 the at&t action was the most recent blow in a nasty fight 
 earlier this month mci sued at&t in federal district court claiming that at&t 's ads are false 
 at&t assembled three of its top executives in washington all <unk> angry to try to <unk> mci 's charges 
 mci has made <unk> out of the upper <unk> of at&t said painewebber 's mr. <unk> who said he expected at&t to become increasingly aggressive in dealing with its longtime <unk>

 billions of investors ' dollars are pouring out of the nation 's junk-bond mutual funds <unk> a <unk> of support in the already reeling junk market 
 last week alone an <unk> $ N billion <unk> out of the junk funds or nearly N N of their total assets according to estimates by <unk> financial services inc. a boston research firm 
 in the past two months the nation 's N junk funds have lost a total of about $ N billion more than N N of assets through sales or transfers of <unk> shares <unk> says 
 it made the estimates based on data collected from more than a dozen big junk funds 
 interviews with three major fund groups fidelity investments vanguard group inc. and t. rowe price associates inc. confirm the trend 
 their junk funds combined have had net outflows totaling nearly $ N million or about N N of their junk fund assets in the past two months 
 some fund managers say negative publicity has <unk> investors ' concern about recent declines in junk-bond prices 
 people have been seeing headline after headline after headline and saying i ca n't take it anymore i 'm getting out says kurt brouwer of brouwer & <unk> a san francisco investment adviser 
 the withdrawals could <unk> trouble for the $ N billion junk market 
 if the heavy outflows continue fund managers will face increasing pressure to sell off some of their junk to pay <unk> investors in the weeks ahead 
 such selling could erode prices of high-yield junk bonds already weakened by a rash of corporate credit problems 
 mutual fund groups have n't lost control of much of the <unk> money says louis <unk> <unk> 's president 
 mutual fund officials say that investors have transferred most of it into their money market accounts and to a lesser extent <unk> funds 
 so the impact on the $ N billion mutual fund industry as a whole probably will be slight 
 but tremors are likely in the junk-bond market which has helped to finance the takeover boom of recent years 
 mutual funds are the among the largest holders of junk accounting for more than a quarter of the entire high-yield high-risk market 
 the N mutual funds investing solely in junk bonds hold assets of about $ N billion 
 other funds hold a <unk> of junk bonds too 
 the $ N billion fidelity high income fund has had a net <unk> of about $ N million in the past two months 
 about $ N million <unk> out last week alone double the level of the week following last month 's campeau corp. credit squeeze 
 about N N of the <unk> was transferred to other fidelity funds says neal <unk> a fidelity vice president marketing with most going into money market funds 
 you get a news item it hits you have strong redemptions that day and for two days following then go back to normal says mr. <unk> 
 the fund with a cash cushion of more than N N has met all the redemptions without having to sell one thing mr. <unk> says 
 he adds our fund has had positive net sales every month for the last three years until this month 
 vanguard 's $ N billion high yield bond portfolio has seen $ N million flow out since early september $ N million of that <unk> out friday oct. N alone 
 still two-thirds of the <unk> has been <unk> into other vanguard portfolios says brian <unk> a vice president 
 the fund now holds a cash position of about N N 
 at the $ N million t. rowe price high yield fund investors <unk> out about $ N million in the past two months 
 those withdrawals most of which were transferred to other t. rowe price funds followed little change in the fund 's sales picture this year through august 
 the last two months have been the whole ball game says steven <unk> a vice president 
 <unk> holders have barely broken even this year as fat interest payments barely managed to offset declining prices 
 through oct. N high-yield funds had an average N N total return the price change plus dividends on fund shares according to lipper analytical services inc 
 that 's even less than the N N total return of the merrill lynch high-yield index 
 fidelity 's junk fund has fallen N N this year through oct. N lipper says the vanguard fund rose N N and the t. rowe price fund edged up N N 
 people who remain in junk funds now could get hit again some analysts and fund specialists say 
 many funds in recent weeks and months have been selling their <unk> junk issues such as rjr nabisco to raise cash to meet expected redemptions 
 funds might be forced to accept lower prices if they expand their selling to the securities of <unk> borrowers 
 and then asset values of the funds could plunge more than they have so far 
 says michael <unk> chief investment officer of republic national bank and manager of the <unk> group in new york it 's a time bomb just waiting to go off 
 the surprise resignation yesterday of british chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson sent sterling into a tailspin against the dollar by creating uncertainties about the direction of the british economy 
 the u.s. unit also firmed against other currencies on the back of sterling 's tumble as market participants switched out of pounds 
 the pound also dropped <unk> against the mark falling below the key <unk> level to N marks from N marks late wednesday 
 mr. lawson 's resignation shocked many analysts despite the recent <unk> speculation of a <unk> between the chancellor and prime minister margaret thatcher 
 indeed only hours earlier mrs. thatcher had called mr. lawson 's economic policies sound and said she has always supported him 
 there was a general feeling that we 'd seen the worst said patrick foley deputy chief economic adviser for <unk> bank in london 
 the resignation came as a great surprise 
 graham <unk> manager of foreign-exchange operations at hong kong & shanghai banking corp. in new york added that mrs. thatcher 's comments reinforced the market 's growing confidence about sterling and compounded the unit 's later decline 
 the market was caught totally the wrong way 
 everyone was extremely long on sterling mr. <unk> said 
 in late new york trading yesterday the dollar was quoted at N marks up from N marks late wednesday and at N yen up from N yen late wednesday 
 sterling was quoted at $ N sharply down from $ N late wednesday 
 in tokyo friday the u.s. currency opened for trading at N yen up from thursday 's tokyo close of N yen 
 few analysts had much good to say about the pound 's near-term prospects despite the fact that most do n't anticipate a shift in mrs. thatcher 's economic policies 
 mr. foley of <unk> noted that mr. lawson 's replacement john major the british foreign minister will take time to establish his credibility and in the meantime sterling could trend downward in volatile trade 
 but mr. foley predicted few economic policy changes ahead commenting that mr. major shares a very similar view of the world with mr. lawson 
 bob <unk> chief economist at <unk> bank in new york also noted that the pound 's sharp decline is pegged more to uncertainty in the market than a vision of altered united kingdom economic policies 
 unless mr. lawson 's resignation leads to a change in british interest-rate policy mrs. thatcher 's administration firmly supports high interest rates to keep inflation in check or <unk> toward full <unk> in the european monetary system 's exchange-rate mechanism mr. lawson 's withdrawal will have little long-term impact on exchange rates mr. <unk> concluded 
 also announcing his resignation thursday was alan walters mrs. thatcher 's economic adviser and mr. lawson 's <unk> 
 the pound which had been trading at about $ N in new york prior to mr. lawson 's announcement sank more than two cents to $ N prompting the federal reserve bank to buy pounds for dollars 
 the fed 's move however only proved a <unk> to the pound 's slide and the fed intervened for a second time at around $ N according to new york traders 
 meanwhile dollar trading was relatively <unk> throughout the session according to dealers who noted that thursday 's release of the preliminary report on the u.s. third-quarter gross national product was something of a <unk> 
 u.s. gnp rose at an annual rate of N N in the third quarter 
 the implicit price deflator a measure of inflation was down to a N N annual rate of increase in the quarter from a N N rate of gain in the second quarter 
 in europe the dollar ended lower in <unk> trading 
 the market closed prior to mr. lawson 's announcement 
 on the commodity exchange in new york gold for current delivery rose $ N to $ N an ounce in heavy trading 
 the close was the highest since august N 
 estimated volume was five million ounces 
 in early trading in hong kong friday gold was quoted at $ N an ounce

 on an office wall of the senate intelligence committee hangs a quote from chairman david boren do n't hold your ticket <unk> the show 's over 
 he once used that line in a <unk> meeting on panama meaning do n't shrink from taking action against manuel noriega 
 so how did a good senator like this end up <unk> a policy that required the u.s. to warn mr. noriega of any coup plot against him 
 i agree it 's ridiculous says mr. boren and indeed by now ridiculous may be the only way to describe how the u.s. decides to take or rather not to take covert action 
 george bush disclosed the policy last week by reading it to gop senators perhaps as a way of shifting blame for the panama <unk> to congress 
 but the broader truth is more complicated and <unk> 
 the policy was contained in an exchange of letters last october between the senate intelligence committee and the cia and national security council 
 staff lawyers for both sides were busy agreeing with one another about what the u.s. could not do to oust the panamanian <unk> 
 they simply got carried away with <unk> what the executive order banning assassinations really meant 
 mr. boren himself did n't discover the <unk> <unk> until mr. bush told him privately at the white house last week 
 it 's ironic that david boren should be in the center of this <unk> 
 a former oklahoma governor he 's a <unk> <unk> of presidential powers in foreign policy 
 he 's a rare democratic <unk> 
 he 's the senator most like arthur <unk> the gop senator from michigan who worked to forge a bipartisan foreign policy in the <unk> 
 <unk> and <unk> are heroes of mine mr. boren says referring as well to sam <unk> the democratic house speaker who <unk> with president <unk> 
 they allowed this country to be credible 
 i really want to see that happen again 
 if this were N mr. boren might even succeed 
 but in N most senators have other ideas 
 last july his committee rejected a reagan administration plan to support a coup in panama 
 ohio democrat howard <unk> refused to support any plan that might get people hurt a <unk> notion for a great power 
 maine republican william cohen said the plan might violate the assassination ban 
 so the administration dropped it 
 by october when the committee rejected a much more modest covert proposal even the administration was agreeing little should be done 
 mr. boren does n't think all this influenced the failed coup this month but he does concede that congress has made mistakes 
 in the aftermath of vietnam in the aftermath of iran-contra i can understand some people might think that if they plan a coup they have to bring their lawyers he says 
 but even mr. boren <unk> congressional oversight 
 writing in the harvard international review he says that his committee approves covert operations only when there 's a consensus 
 so what does consensus mean 
 it does n't mean <unk> he insists though he implies it means a bipartisan majority 
 the <unk> of u.s. foreign policy is essential he explains 
 why was <unk> so successful 
 because it had bipartisan support 
 mr. boren is confusing consensus on general principles with agreement on specific actions 
 elliott abrams a veteran of intelligence committee debates doubts that even <unk> or the <unk> <unk> would have taken place if consensus had been required 
 <unk> and <unk> were <unk> enough to leave specific operations to presidents modern senators mr. boren notwithstanding are less modest 
 the result is that the senate committee has what amounts to veto power over every covert action 
 i would n't say it 's quite a veto mr. boren <unk> 
 but would n't a president who acted despite senate objections be taking grave political risks 
 he would agrees the chairman 
 but that is something the president ought to know before he goes ahead 
 mr. boren even <unk> a silver <unk> 
 he figures the episode will help clarify any <unk> between the committee and administration 
 he points to a letter on his desk his second in a week from president bush saying that they do n't disagree 
 more broadly mr. boren hopes that panama will shock washington out of its fear of using military power 
 maybe this will jolt us out of the <unk> syndrome that we never are prepared to use force he says 
 maybe if every senator shared the principles of mr. boren 
 but it 's just as <unk> to argue that if even david boren can get mired in this sort of mess the problem goes beyond legal interpretation 
 maybe the problem is a political system that wo n't act without an exchange of letters that insists on running foreign policy by committee that <unk> a president as just another guy at the table 
 the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> is that we ca n't abolish these oversight committees because we 've seen too many abuses of executive power 
 but panama illustrates that their substitute is a system that produces an absurd gridlock 
 the lawyers are now in charge of our national security 
 in panama the u.s. interests at stake were <unk> minor the only people killed were foreigners <unk> enough to trust american will 
 americans may not be so lucky the next time 
 i was impressed by the <unk> of your sept. N story rural enterprise tough row to <unk> 
 we lived in rural areas many years but now live in st. louis county <unk> 
 this morning as i drove the N miles to my law office and <unk> the routine heavy traffic during that <unk> <unk> i thought of how <unk> it was that we made the decision to be residents of an expanding community with so many opportunities and where so much is happening 
 the presence of so many people cars and competing businesses is evidence of a healthy economy in a place where people want to live 
 i thought back to our time in small <unk> <unk> communities 
 i remembered how hard it was for an outsider to become accepted by <unk> <unk> residents and what <unk> <unk> an original <unk> in <unk> that were long accustomed to <unk> safe ways of thought and action 
 i remembered being fired at age N with five children at home when my views and actions were deemed <unk> by a <unk> small-town employer 
 how difficult it is for a thinking person to live among <unk> rooted in the past 
 now i <unk> in the freedom culture activity and diversity of this great metropolitan area with its traffic <unk> and perpetual <unk> projects 
 yet when my youngest child died two years ago i buried him in the church cemetery of a small missouri town 
 so after all even the <unk> critic of rural exclusivity harbors a continuing <unk> for those scarce rural <unk> thought to exist amid fields <unk> and country <unk>

 finnish government officials are negotiating with creditors of waertsilae marine oy a major shipyard that filed for bankruptcy protection this week amid confusion and mounting doubts that collapse of the nation 's entire shipbuilding industry can be <unk> 
 at stake are almost N jobs in an industry that has been the mainstay of finland 's <unk> economic revival 
 shipbuilding became a point of pride as finnish <unk> remained profitable long after rivals collapsed all over europe 
 but if as many now fear waertsilae marine joins the ranks of failed <unk> it might turn out to be remembered most as a <unk> on finland 's international reputation 
 the shipyard 's N billion finnish <unk> $ N billion backlog includes about N ships ordered by big international shippers including three for carnival cruise lines inc 
 miami-based carnival said the first of the three ships is scheduled to be delivered next month just in time for the winter tourist season in the caribbean 
 the second ship is scheduled to be delivered in fall N and the third in fall N 
 one analyst said the first ship probably will be delivered close to schedule but that carnival may have to pay up to N N more to get the second and third ships 
 all the ships are covered by loan guarantees from a state export financing agency even though it 's not clear whether they will actually be built 
 bankers worry that if the government makes good a threat to withdraw its guarantee commitments shippers will counter with a <unk> of lawsuits 
 state loan guarantees are rarely a source of controversy 
 however some bankers cited possible parallels between the waertsilae marine case and the collapse of norway 's state-owned <unk> <unk> as two years ago 
 in that case international banks and investors incurred big losses because they incorrectly believed the company 's debt carried implicit state guarantees 
 doubts about the quality of state credit guarantees could reduce the competitive strength of finnish companies in world markets where financing often is the key to winning orders analysts warn 
 moreover state-owned finnish companies lacking formal state guarantees could face greater difficulty raising funds in international financial markets bankers say 
 the decision by a majority of <unk> waertsilae marine directors monday to file for bankruptcy was an abrupt <unk> from previous government policy 
 in august the government played a major part in a sweeping restructuring of the troubled shipyard 
 at the time <unk> by oy waertsilae a conglomerate the shipbuilding unit faced potential losses estimated at one billion <unk> and was on the brink of liquidation 
 under the rescue plan waertsilae sold N N of its stake to a group of banks and pension funds 
 the government in turn guaranteed financing to complete the order backlog and took control of the board 
 government officials were expected to combine waertsilae marine with two other struggling firms and thus ensure finland 's survival as a shipbuilding nation 
 the government spent most of last year attempting to carry out such a plan but was <unk> when the parent waertsilae concern pulled out at the last minute 
 after the restructuring of waertsilae marine and bolstered by state loan guarantees two big bank creditors union bank of finland and state-controlled <unk> resumed lending the shipyard working capital 
 but the bankers got cold feet recently as government officials complained they had been <unk> about the shipyard 's actual financial condition and hinted the credit guarantees might be withdrawn 
 people familiar with monday 's board meeting said it was the state 's refusal to <unk> <unk> the credit guarantees that led union bank and <unk> to halt lending to waertsilae marine 
 then in a <unk> <unk> <unk> directors voted to file for bankruptcy apparently under instructions from finland 's industry minister <unk> <unk> 
 analysts say mr. <unk> had grown increasingly worried about the state 's potential financial exposure as waertsilae marine 's losses <unk> to more than double the figure estimated in august 
 noting that sweden wound up <unk> state subsidies of about N billion swedish kronor $ N billion during the 1970s in a <unk> attempt to salvage its shipbuilding industry one analyst suggested that mr. <unk> may have decided to cut finland 's losses once and for all 
 senior ministry officials <unk> with creditors during the week in an attempt to agree on some form of restructuring that would keep waertsilae marine operating 
 the talks may drag on for weeks before any concrete result is announced people familiar with them said 
 one solution would be to sell the shipyard to an outsider 
 but there appear to be few if any suitors 
 indeed the potential losses make any rescue scheme unlikely unless the politicians once again change <unk> and agree to pick up the bill analysts said 
 meantime shippers with vessels on order from waertsilae marine will remain in limbo 
 turner broadcasting system inc. said it expects to report an extraordinary loss of about $ N million in the fourth quarter due to early retirement of debt 
 the cable <unk> said the loss will consist primarily of prepayment penalties and <unk> issue discount and costs related to its <unk> $ N billion refinancing of its long-term debt and some preferred stock in one of its subsidiaries 
 a turner spokesman would n't speculate on the extent of the charge 's effect on the quarter 's earnings but said the company continues to expect to report a net loss for N 
 the company said the repayment or redemption of the long-term debt and the outstanding class a cumulative <unk> preferred stock of cable news network was made possible by an offering of about $ N million of debentures and notes and $ N million in bank borrowings 
 the offering included $ N million of N N senior subordinated debentures due N and $ N million of zero coupon liquid yield option notes due N 
 the notes were priced to yield N N and are convertible into the company 's class b common stock at a price which represents a N N premium over the market price on oct. N N 
 in addition the company called its N N N senior subordinated notes due N with an <unk> principal amount of $ N million for redemption on dec. N 
 as a result of the refinancing the company said the interest on the debt will fall to slightly more than N N from slightly more than N N

 <unk> australia ltd. under pressure from bank lenders has called in accounting firm peat <unk> <unk> to help oversee asset sales and restructure the resorts and media company 
 analysts said the move could <unk> even <unk> action by the banks 
 but any move by the banks to take over qintex australia 's management could threaten its ability to operate its national television network under australian broadcast license rules 
 that in turn could substantially reduce the value of the television assets 
 the appointment of peat <unk> which has a unit that specializes in advising troubled companies came about as a result of a round of meetings held by qintex australia chairman christopher skase with bank creditors 
 yesterday mr. skase said the company is <unk> and with the continued support of its bankers is able to meet its financial commitments 
 qintex australia is a unit of qintex ltd 
 the qintex group 's problems began in <unk> in march when mr. skase agreed to buy mgm\/ua communications co 
 but the transaction faltered in september when qintex australia was forced to increase its offer to us$ N billion following a <unk> from rupert murdoch the deal fell apart altogether earlier this month 
 qintex australia owes creditors around a$ N billion 
 last friday qintex entertainment inc. its <unk> u.s. tv production and distribution affiliate filed for chapter N protection 
 the government is <unk> its newest weapon against white-collar defendants the power to prevent them from paying their legal bills 
 and defense lawyers are warning that they wo n't stick around if they do n't get paid 
 the issue has come to a <unk> in newark n.j. where federal prosecutors have warned lawyers for eddie antar that if the founder and former chairman of crazy eddie inc. is indicted the government may move to seize the money that mr. antar is using to pay legal fees 
 the warning by the u.s. attorney 's office follows two decisions by the u.s. supreme court last june 
 in those cases the high court ruled that federal law gives prosecutors broad authority to seize assets of people accused of racketeering and drug-related crimes including fees paid to lawyers before an indictment 
 if the government succeeds in <unk> mr. antar 's assets he could be left without <unk> legal representation because his attorneys are likely to quit according to individuals familiar with the case 
 a seizure also would make the case the largest and one of the first in which lawyers ' fees have been confiscated in a prosecution unrelated to drugs 
 the people who suffer in the short run are defendants but the people who suffer in the long run are all of the people because there wo n't be a vigorous private bar to defend the bill of rights says gerald <unk> a criminal defense attorney who says he has turned down a number of cases to avoid possible fee seizures 
 mr. antar is being investigated by a federal grand jury in newark where prosecutors have told him that they may soon seek an indictment on racketeering and securities fraud charges 
 under the <unk> influenced and corrupt organizations law or rico the government has the authority to seek to freeze or seize a defendant 's assets before trial 
 according to individuals familiar with mr. antar 's case prosecutors issued their warning this week after one of mr. antar 's attorneys asked whether legal fees might be subject to seizure 
 in a letter prosecutors told mr. antar 's lawyers that because of the recent supreme court rulings they could expect that any fees collected from mr. antar may be seized 
 prosecutors have told mr. antar 's attorneys that they believe mr. antar 's allegedly <unk> gains are so great that any money he has used to pay attorneys <unk> from illegal activities 
 therefore they said the money can be taken from the lawyers even after they are paid 
 justin <unk> and jack <unk> attorneys for mr. antar both declined to comment on the matter 
 in newark u.s. attorney samuel a. <unk> said i do n't think there 's any legal reason to limit forfeiture of attorney 's fees to drug cases 
 mr. <unk> said his office just responded to an attorney 's question about whether we would go after attorney 's fees and that is different from actually doing it although we reserve that right 
 mr. antar was charged last month in a civil suit filed in federal court in newark by the securities and exchange commission 
 in that suit the sec accused mr. antar of engaging in a massive financial fraud to <unk> the earnings of crazy eddie edison n.j. over a three-year period 
 through his lawyers mr. antar has denied allegations in the sec suit and in civil suits previously filed by shareholders against mr. antar and others 
 the sec has alleged that mr. antar aimed to pump up the company 's stock price through false financial statements in order to sell his stake and reap huge profits 
 mr. antar the sec said made more than $ N million from the sale of his shares between N and N 
 the justice department has emphasized that the government 's <unk> power is to be used <unk> 
 according to department policy prosecutors must make a strong showing that lawyers ' fees came from assets tainted by illegal profits before any attempts at seizure are made 
 still criminal defense lawyers worry that defendants are being deprived of their sixth amendment right to counsel and a fair trial if the government can seize lawyers ' fees 
 they also worry that if the government applies <unk> laws broadly the best defense lawyers will be unwilling to take criminal cases unless they are assured of being paid 
 the stock market correction of oct. N N was a grim reminder of the oct. N N market collapse 
 since like earthquakes stock market <unk> will always be with us it is prudent to take all possible <unk> against another such market collapse 
 in general markets function well and adjust smoothly to changing economic and financial circumstances 
 but there are times when they seize up and <unk> sellers can not find buyers 
 that 's just what happened in the october N crash 
 as the market tumbled <unk> market conditions prevailed the margins between buying bids and selling bids widened trading in many stocks was suspended orders took <unk> long to be executed and many specialists stopped trading altogether 
 these failures in turn contributed to the fall in the market averages uncertainty <unk> an extra risk premium and <unk> triggered additional selling pressures 
 the situation was like that of a <unk> who is thrown slightly off balance by an unexpected <unk> on the <unk> 
 his <unk> spread <unk> and <unk> apart just as <unk> spreads widen during a financial panic and soon he is out of control 
 unable to stop his accelerating <unk> he crashes 
 after the N crash and as a result of the recommendations of many studies circuit breakers were devised to allow market participants to <unk> and restore orderly market conditions 
 it 's doubtful though whether circuit breakers do any real good 
 in the additional time they provide even more order imbalances might pile up as would-be sellers finally get their broker on the phone 
 instead an appropriate institution should be charged with the job of preventing chaos in the market the federal reserve 
 the availability of timely assistance of a <unk> can help markets retain their resilience 
 the fed already buys and sells foreign exchange to prevent <unk> conditions in foreign-exchange markets 
 the fed has assumed a similar responsibility in the market for government securities 
 the stock market is the only major market without a <unk> of <unk> liquidity or a buyer of last resort 
 this does not mean that the federal reserve does not already play an important indirect role in the stock market 
 in N it pumped billions into the markets through open market operations and the discount window 
 it lent money to banks and encouraged them to make funds available to brokerage houses 
 they in turn lent money to their customers who were supposed to recognize the opportunity to make a profit in the turmoil and buy shares 
 the fed also has the power to set margin requirements 
 but would n't it be more efficient and effective to supply such support to the stock market directly 
 instead of flooding the entire economy with liquidity and thereby increasing the danger of inflation the fed could support the stock market directly by buying market averages in the futures market thus stabilizing the market as a whole 
 the stock market is certainly not too big for the fed to handle 
 the foreign-exchange and government securities markets are <unk> larger 
 daily trading volume in the new york foreign exchange market is $ N billion 
 the daily volume for treasury securities is about $ N billion 
 the combined value of daily equity trading on the new york exchange the american stock exchange and the nasdaq over-the-counter market ranges between $ N billion and $ N billion 
 the $ N billion the fed <unk> into the money markets after the N crash is more than enough to buy all the stocks traded on a typical day 
 more carefully targeted intervention might actually reduce the need for government action 
 and taking more direct action has the advantage of avoiding sharp increases in the money supply such as happened in october N 
 the fed 's stock market role ought not to be very ambitious 
 it should seek only to maintain the <unk> of markets not to <unk> up the dow jones or new york stock exchange averages at a particular level 
 the fed should guard against <unk> risk but not against the risks inherent in individual stocks 
 it would be inappropriate for the government or the central bank to buy or sell ibm or general motors shares 
 instead the fed could buy the broad market <unk> in the futures market 
 the increased demand would <unk> trading and stabilize prices 
 stabilizing the derivative markets would tend to stabilize the primary market 
 the fed would eliminate the cause of the potential panic rather than attempting to treat the <unk> the liquidity of the banks 
 <unk> market conditions could be observed quite frequently in foreign exchange markets in the 1960s and 1970s 
 but since the member countries of the international monetary fund agreed to the guidelines to floating in N such difficulties have been avoided 
 i can not recall any <unk> in currency markets since the N guidelines were adopted 
 thus the mere existence of a <unk> agency helps to avoid panic in <unk> 
 the old saying advises if it ai n't broke do n't fix it 
 but this could be a case where we all might go broke if it is n't fixed 
 mr. heller now at visa international was a governor of the federal reserve board from N until earlier this year 
 this is adapted from a speech to the commonwealth club in san francisco 
 bank of england governor robin <unk> urged banks to be cautious in financing leveraged buy-outs 
 caution should be the rule of the day said mr. <unk> in a speech to the association of corporate <unk> ' annual dinner 
 it would be damaging to industry and to the financial sector in general to say nothing of banks if <unk> does not guide the financing of leveraged transactions 
 his remarks were distributed to the press before chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson announced his resignation last evening 
 bank of england officials said the central bank had no comment on mr. lawson 's resignation 
 mr. <unk> reiterated that the exposure of united kingdom banks to leveraged deals have n't yet reached worrying levels 
 however in light of the risks involved in such transactions banks should satisfy themselves that they have the skills to participate in this market and clear policy guidelines on acceptable levels of exposure to such transactions he said 
 in other comments he said takeovers may not always be the most efficient way of <unk> a change of corporate direction or strategy 
 a similar result could sometimes be achieved at less cost by changing <unk> he said 
 intel corp. 's most powerful computer chip has flaws that could delay several computer makers ' marketing efforts but the bugs are n't expected to hurt intel and most computer makers 
 computer experts familiar with the flaws found in intel 's N chip say the defects do n't affect the average user and are likely to be cleared up before most computers using the chip as their brains appear on the market sometime next year 
 intel said that last week a customer discovered two flaws in its N microprocessor chip 's <unk> unit a set of circuits that do certain calculations 
 on friday intel began <unk> customers about the bugs which cause the chip to give wrong answers for some <unk> calculations 
 but while international business machines corp. and compaq computer corp. say the bugs will delay products most big computer makers said the flaws do n't affect them 
 bugs like this are just a normal part of product development said richard <unk> director of hewlett-packard co. 's advanced systems development 
 <unk> announced last week that it planned to ship a computer based on the N chip early next year 
 these bugs do n't affect our schedule at all he said 
 likewise <unk> research inc. and sun microsystems inc. said the bugs wo n't delay their development of <unk> machines 
 we have n't modified our schedules in any way said a sun spokesman 
 to switch to another vendor 's chips would definitely not be an option he said 
 nonetheless concern about the chip may have been responsible for a decline of N cents in intel 's stock to $ N a share yesterday in over-the-counter trading on volume of N shares and partly responsible for a drop in compaq 's stock in new york stock exchange composite trading on wednesday 
 yesterday compaq plunged further closing at $ N a share off $ N a share on volume of N shares 
 most of compaq 's decline is being attributed to a third-quarter earnings report that came in at the low end of analysts ' expectations 
 intel said it had corrected the problems and would start producing <unk> chips next week 
 we should not be seeing any more said bill rash intel 's director for the N chip 
 what 's more the bugs only emerge on <unk> applications such as <unk> design and scientific calculations he said and then very seldom 
 these <unk> do not affect business programs he said 
 the bugs will cause problems in specific and rare circumstances that will not occur in typical applications such as <unk> and <unk> said michael <unk> editor of the microprocessor report an industry newsletter 
 sun hewlett-packard and others say intel is n't wholly to blame for the <unk> 
 the real <unk> they said are computer makers such as ibm that have jumped the gun to unveil <unk> products 
 the reason this is getting so much <unk> is that some started shipping and announced early availability said hewlett-packard 's mr. <unk> 
 you can do that but you 're taking a risk 
 those companies are paying the price for taking the risk 
 in late september ibm began shipping a <unk> card that <unk> its <unk> model <unk> from a N machine to an N machine 
 an ibm spokeswoman said the company told customers monday about the bugs and temporarily stopped shipping the product 
 ibm has no plans to recall its <unk> cards the spokeswoman said and could probably <unk> the bugs without long product delays 
 we do n't look at this as a major problem for us she said 
 compaq which said it discovered the bugs still plans to announce new N products on nov. N 
 because of the <unk> however the company said it does n't know when its machine will be <unk> available 
 that 's a break from compaq tradition because the company does n't announce products until they 're actually at the dealers 
 the problem is being <unk> experts say because the N is intel 's future flagship 
 intel 's microprocessors are the chips of choice in many of today 's personal computers and the N microprocessor is the <unk> of the company 's bid to guard that spot in the next generation of machines 
 although these sorts of bugs are not at all uncommon the N is an extremely <unk> product said mr. <unk> the newsletter editor 
 intel 's N chip is the <unk> of intel 's microprocessors a <unk> <unk> chip that only the most <unk> computer users are likely to buy for at least several years 
 unveiled last april the chip <unk> N million <unk> on a <unk> of silicon more than four times as many as on intel 's earlier model N 
 intel <unk> the chip 's speed at N million instructions per second or mips 
 that 's four times as fast as the N 
 machines using the N are expected to challenge <unk> work stations and minicomputers in applications such as so-called <unk> which <unk> groups of computers together and in <unk> design 
 but while the chip 's speed in processing power is <unk> it 's real strength lies in its software <unk> 
 the N is the <unk> of a long series of intel chips that began <unk> the market ever since ibm picked the <unk> N chip for its first personal computer 
 a <unk> microprocessor processes N pieces of data at a time and is slower than newer <unk> chips 
 since then intel has <unk> a large part of the market with <unk> generations of <unk> and <unk> chips all of which can run software written for previous models 
 that 's what will keep computer makers coming in spite of the <unk> of bugs 
 big personal computer makers and many makers of engineering workstations are developing <unk> machines which are expected to reach the market early next year 
 of the big computer makers only apple computer co. bases its machines on motorola chips instead 
 the N is going to have a big impact on the industry said hewlett-packard 's mr. <unk> 
 it 's going to be the leading edge technology in personal computers for the next few years 
 this <unk> is not going to have any affect on that at all

 bethlehem steel corp. has agreed in principle to form a joint venture with the world 's second-largest steelmaker <unk> of france to modernize a portion of bethlehem 's ailing <unk> division 
 the venture which involves adding sophisticated equipment to make <unk> mill rolls is part of a <unk> effort to shore up a division that has posted continuing operating losses for several years 
 the other element includes consolidating <unk> 's <unk> operations 
 the entire division employs about N workers 
 while the joint venture affects only a small part of bethlehem 's operations it is significant because it marks the first time the nation 's no. N steelmaker has joined forces with a foreign partner 
 wall street analysts have criticized bethlehem for not following its major competitors in linking with a foreign company to share costs and provide technology to modernize old facilities or build new ones 
 we think it 's a step in the right direction for bethlehem said <unk> <unk> <unk> group 's international steel analyst 
 it 's important to share the risk and even more so when the market has already peaked 
 he said the move could be the beginning of a broader relationship between the two companies one that could open up new markets for bethlehem 
 bethlehem had little choice but to go with a european steelmaker because its competitors already have tapped the japanese and south korean industry leaders analysts noted 
 under terms of the agreement <unk> 's <unk> unit and bethlehem would establish a <unk> facility to make <unk> mill rolls at the company 's <unk> shop here 
 terms for the venture which would be jointly owned by both companies were n't disclosed 
 the <unk> unit has agreed to provide technology and expertise to install a so-called spin <unk> by early next fall 
 the <unk> improves the <unk> quality of the iron mill rolls which are basically huge rolling <unk> used to <unk> or shape steel products 
 bethlehem is also working with the united steelworkers union to consolidate <unk> 's two machine shops and four <unk> facilities of the <unk> operations 
 once the consolidation is complete bethlehem plans to concentrate its <unk> business on nuclear fabrication <unk> steel and <unk> steel rolls for rolling mills and selected <unk> applications 
 bethlehem said earlier this year that it planned to restructure the <unk> division to improve its cost structure 
 in the second quarter bethlehem posted a $ N million charge related to its plans to <unk> the division 
 if you 're still wondering about the causes of the slump in the junk-bond market consider the case of columbia savings & loan 
 the california thrift has just announced a $ N million third-quarter loss 
 how did this happen 
 well when congress in its recent s&l bailout mandated that the thrifts sell off all their junk-bond holdings by N it not only artificially increased the supply of these bonds in the market but also eliminated one of the few profitable investments thrifts have made 
 but there is a <unk> ironic twist to the columbia loss 
 as <unk> of the debate over a capital-gains tax cut know there is much talk in congress and indeed all over washington about the need to encourage long-term investment and discourage the financial sector 's presumed <unk> with the short term 
 now we regard this as a largely phony issue but the long term is nonetheless a big salon topic all around the <unk> 
 it turns out that columbia had this huge loss in large part because the new <unk> mandated rules forced it to adjust the book value of its <unk> junk bonds to the lower of either their cost or market value 
 they could no longer be classified as what columbia regarded them namely long-term investments 
 congress 's <unk> treatment of the existing structure of junk-bond holdings <unk> us of a story in the journal earlier this year about the baby bell companies ' desire to have the <unk> bans lifted on offering information services 
 the issue of seeking relief from congress was raised to <unk> <unk> the chairman of nynex 
 mr. <unk> replied legislation tends to be <unk> 
 i believe we have to take a shot at getting as much done as we can through the court through justice and through state and federal regulatory agencies 
 i see congress as a last resort 
 healthy thrifts such as columbia or the junk-bond market itself should have been so lucky 
 the reality of life in modern america is that if you want to <unk> something that works let it fall into the hands of congress 
 exxon corp. said it will move its headquarters from manhattan to dallas 
 most of the N employees at the oil company 's <unk> headquarters building including much of senior management were <unk> of the plan until informed at a morning meeting by chairman lawrence g. <unk> 
 the shift wo n't affect operations 
 as part of its restructuring several years ago exxon moved most of those out of the city and sold its <unk> rockefeller center <unk> to a japanese company 
 but the pullout is an embarrassment to new york city officials coming at a time of high office building vacancy rates and departures by other major companies 
 mobil corp. is in the process of <unk> its headquarters here and huge operations like j.c. penney & co. and trans world airlines have recently left 
 new york authorities informed yesterday about the move reacted with concern and even some anger to the idea of the nation 's third-largest corporation leaving without giving them an opportunity to accommodate it 
 we are <unk> but there 's nothing we can do about it now said stanley <unk> new york city deputy mayor for finance and economic development 
 meanwhile dallas welcomed the move 
 city officials there had been were aware that a large company was moving in but negotiations had all been conducted through a law firm and under the code name <unk> 
 when we were told it was exxon it was beyond all expectations what a coup said tom lewis senior vice president of dallas partnership the economic development affiliate of the city 's chamber of commerce 
 dallas its economy based on oil and real estate has been in a slump 
 exxon said it will build a new headquarters on a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> las <unk> complex in the suburb of irving 
 until the building is completed exxon will rent part of an existing office tower 
 las <unk> once a huge texas ranch is a <unk> complex of office buildings homes and recreational facilities that its developers have been struggling to <unk> in recent years 
 exxon officials said it will cost less to run its headquarters at las <unk> than in new york 
 the company wo n't say how much it will save but during at its interim location sources say it will likely pay rent of $ N to $ N per square foot 
 owners of the building in new york say they will be asking $ N per square foot for rent to fill the space that exxon is <unk> 
 in texas taxes and development costs are also lower they said 
 plus one exxon official said by eliminating the typically long new york <unk> between office and home management will expect employees to work N hours a week in dallas rather than a <unk> work week in new york 
 canadian production of market pulp rose N N in september from a year earlier as the industry operated at N N of capacity 
 the canadian pulp and paper association an industry group said canadian mills produced N metric tons of market pulp in september compared with N metric tons a year earlier 
 market pulp is wood pulp sold on the open market to producers of paper and other products 
 the statistics exclude pulp consumed at the producing mill or shipped to another mill that is affiliated with the producing mill 
 canada is the world 's largest producer of market pulp 
 the september N N operating rate compared with a rate of N N in august but was unchanged from a year earlier 
 in the first nine months of this year output was N metric tons down from N metric tons a year earlier 
 ima holdings corp. completed its $ N billion acquisition of american medical international inc. purchasing N million shares or N N of the los angeles-based health-care services concern for $ N a share 
 the price also includes assumption of about $ N billion in debt 
 ima is a group that includes first boston corp. and the <unk> family of chicago through the leveraged buy-out fund harry gray <unk> klein & partners 
 harry j. gray and <unk> n. klein along with five other ima <unk> were named to join american medical 's <unk> board 
 the completion of the merger agreement follows months of <unk> and turns 
 in january american medical brought in a new chief executive officer richard a. <unk> N who will remain as chairman president and chief executive 
 a few days later american medical announced sharply lower earnings taking charges of $ N million for insurance reserves and canceled real estate leases 
 in march american medical received a $ <unk> offer to take the company private from an investor group including large holder m. lee pearce 
 it also was considering a restructuring to help boost the stock price 
 a group including several members of the the bass family of texas urged the company to take some steps to maximize shareholder value 
 the following month the company put itself up for sale 
 it received more offers but the auction was surprisingly won by ima which bid $ N a share and asked mr. <unk> to stay on as an equity participant 
 he indicated that some assets might be sold off to service the debt 
 then after extending its offer four times waiting for a congressional tax ruling ima early this month lowered its offer to $ N a share amid turbulence in the junk bond market 
 american medical accepted the offer meanwhile indicating it had heard from two other suitors 
 but they never materialized and ima completed the purchase yesterday

 treasury secretary nicholas brady said that congress should grant the securities and exchange commission the power to close the stock markets in periods of crisis 
 in testimony to the senate securities subcommittee mr. brady disputed the view of sec chairman richard breeden who told a house panel wednesday that he does n't want the ability to halt the markets 
 mr. breeden contended that discretionary power could have an impact on the markets if rumors were to <unk> about when the exchanges might be closed 
 he added that the president already has the power to close the markets in an emergency 
 but mr. brady argued that the sec is closer to the markets and in a better position to understand when the exchanges are under such stress that they should be closed 
 separately mr. brady said he asked the working group on financial markets to determine whether futures margins are too low 
 he noted that some minimum margin requirements have been reduced to levels below those before the N crash 
 this raises questions whether futures and equity margin requirements are consistent at these levels and whether futures margins are adequate mr. brady said 
 margins are the amount of money an investor needs to put up to buy or sell a futures contract 
 margins on the futures exchanges typically are raised and lowered according to market volatility 
 the chicago mercantile exchange margins for the standard & poor 's N stock-index futures stood at $ N a contract for speculators and $ N for <unk> before oct. N N that day the hedging margin was raised to $ N 
 margins were raised or lowered about a dozen times since the crash oct. N N 
 currently they stand at $ N for speculators who are typically individuals and <unk> traders and $ N for <unk> which are usually institutions and have offsetting positions in the underlying stocks 
 mr. brady also said he expects the leveraged buy-out phenomenon to end under its own weight 
 asked whether there is anything congress should do to curb the lbo boom mr. brady responded i think the lbo phenomenon while it wo n't stop completely will be a thing of the past 
 before taking any action he advised the panel to see what the market has produced as a cure 
 mr. brady also agreed with senators ' concerns about recent stock-market volatility and said he <unk> that the gyrations are scaring investors from investing in stocks 
 but he added that individuals still are participating in the equity market indirectly through mutual funds and pension funds 
 the former wall street executive refused to offer an opinion on the controversy surrounding program trading which has recently become a larger part of the trading in the market and has been blamed for accelerating the drop two weeks ago 
 i do not have a view of whether we should do anything about program trading at this time he said 
 but mr. brady endorsed the <unk> bill that both houses of congress will try to push through this session 
 that bill proposed by the sec last year would require brokerage firms to disclose the financial positions of their holding companies mandate large traders ' reporting of program or block trades and improve clearing and settlement of trades between the futures and stock markets 
 the bill also would give the sec the power to close the markets a discretion that former sec chairman david <unk> wanted but mr. breeden does n't 
 mr. brady and senators agreed to have their staffs meet within the next week to start <unk> the bill 
 the senate agriculture committee is responding to trading abuses in the futures markets with a far-reaching bill that would become the futures trading practices act of N 
 the proposed legislation has a <unk> goal to assure the integrity of the u.s. futures markets 
 however as is common with sweeping legislation the proposal contains many provisions that could destroy important parts of the system it sets out to preserve 
 the complex bill introduced by sens. patrick <unk> d. <unk> richard <unk> r. ind. and bob <unk> d. neb. covers a wide range of provisions that would affect the funding and authority of the commodity futures trading commission and would <unk> change the way the industry is regulated 
 these include provisions relating to the technology and systems that must be employed by exchanges oversight and disciplinary procedures for exchange trading practices the relationship between commodity brokerage firms and floor traders and exchange <unk> 
 the bill also <unk> even minor rule <unk> to <unk> and provides for recovery of punitive damages in civil lawsuits and arbitration cases without any showing of willful misconduct 
 many aspects of the bill are <unk> providing appropriate public <unk> that can and should be instituted throughout the industry 
 indeed some of the bill 's requirements including broad representation on the exchanges ' boards of directors and strong measures to prevent conflicts of interest already have been put in place by the coffee sugar & cocoa exchange and other futures exchanges 
 other aspects of the bill however are either structured in ways that create unnecessary burdens for the industry or actually are harmful to the exchanges the industry and ultimately the general public 
 one of the most prominent features is the requirement that in three years all exchanges have in place a system that records all trades by a source independent of the executing broker 
 the new york futures exchanges have been working together to develop a trade recording system much like the one called for in the bill 
 we would be <unk> to have such a system in place today 
 but is it realistic for congress to mandate by a rigid deadline a system that has not yet been <unk> to <unk> studies 
 what if the system does n't work 
 what if the only system that does work is so expensive that at best only the largest exchanges can afford it 
 cost is a key consideration because of the global sweep of the financial markets 
 the u.s. futures exchanges compete world-wide as never before 
 today trading in almost any commodity can be diverted from u.s. markets with just a few strokes of a <unk> 
 all foreign markets are aggressively <unk> u.s. business 
 in fact several london markets already offer lower costs for trading in the same or very similar contracts 
 the u.s. exchanges need both market integrity and <unk> long-term growth depends on it 
 the senate bill contains many provisions that will increase the costs of trading 
 the most <unk> of these is the <unk> of service fees which will directly widen the cost spread between u.s. and foreign markets 
 other provisions have a more <unk> but nonetheless real and <unk> effect on the international position of u.s. exchanges 
 these include the extension of liability into areas beyond those established by judicial precedent and the expansion of liability to include punitive damages 
 in addition to increasing costs as a result of greater financial exposure for members these measures could have other far-reaching <unk> 
 one section of the bill would make all commodity brokerage firms and floor brokers liable for damages without willful misconduct 
 nowhere in the federal securities law is simple negligence or <unk> action a source of liability under similar circumstances 
 it is only logical to assume that the enactment of this provision will lead to increased litigation 
 in an already <unk> business commodity brokerage firms may well decide to eliminate the risk and expense of dealing with the retail public <unk> the private individual of access to the markets 
 another measure makes commodity brokerage firms liable for violations committed by independent floor brokers who execute trades for them 
 this <unk> concept would <unk> these firms to potentially <unk> punitive damages 
 faced with the virtually impossible task of <unk> the execution of each trade many commodity brokerage firms are likely to stop doing business with <unk> and instead hire their own <unk> floor brokers 
 this would force out of business many of the individuals and small firms that function as floor brokers 
 a consequence of their departure could be a serious <unk> of market liquidity 
 finally under the bill a number of legitimate longstanding business practices would be <unk> banned unless the cftc were to take specific and timely action to permit them to continue 
 in other words regulation will occur through <unk> and <unk> rather than through a normal <unk> procedure 
 the affected practices include the placing of oral orders which is the way most public customer orders are placed and trading between affiliated brokers even though in some cases trading with affiliates may be the only way to obtain the best execution for a client 
 also <unk> would be dual trading <unk> a broker trades for customers as well as his own account a practice that provides needed liquidity to the markets 
 all u.s. futures exchanges agree that these and other trading practices require proper regulation and supervision 
 nonetheless each has too much potential value to the system to be banned by legislative fiat before the cftc carefully considers all the consequences of a ban and what the regulatory alternatives are 
 the markets are complex as is the environment in which they function 
 when problems surface the temptation becomes strong to <unk> overhaul a market system that has served for more than N years 
 that temptation must be put aside to permit careful consideration of all the implications positive and negative of the proposed resolutions to those problems and to avoid creating a marketplace where no one trades

 initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell to a seasonally adjusted N for the week ended oct. N from N the previous week the labor department said 
 the number of people receiving state benefits in the week ended oct. N fell to a seasonally adjusted N or N N of those covered by unemployment insurance from N the previous week when the insured unemployment rate was N N 
 counting all state and federal benefit programs the number of people receiving unemployment benefits in the week ended oct. N fell to N from N a week earlier

 one man said you act as a <unk> a <unk> tells him a diversion to relieve people 's <unk> 
 mr. mahfouz 's cairo also has <unk> <unk> and <unk> wives who look to god not crime for their <unk> 
 but it is his portrait of cairo <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> of streets filled with dust <unk> <unk> and animal <unk> that made his reputation and won him the nobel prize in N 
 three novels the beginning and the end N pages $ N the thief and the dogs N pages $ N and <unk> song N pages $ N recently published by <unk> offer an <unk> sample of the <unk> mr. mahfouz 's talent 
 but they do show the range of a <unk> <unk> whose <unk> novels span five decades and include work of social <unk> protest and <unk> 
 they also chart the evolution of a city that has grown tenfold in the author 's lifetime from a colonial <unk> of <unk> <unk> to a third world <unk> <unk> on its own refuse 
 soon it 'll be so crowded a <unk> complains that people will start eating each other 
 the beginning and the end easily the best of the three belongs to mr. mahfouz 's realistic period and it is the one for which he is most <unk> 
 published in N it follows the decline of a cairo family with the <unk> sweep and rich detail that critics often compare to <unk> <unk> and <unk> 
 a minor bureaucrat dies suddenly <unk> his family to poverty and eventual <unk> 
 his daughter turns to <unk> then to peddling herself for a few <unk> 
 one son <unk> his own career so that his <unk> brother can succeed while another helps support the family with money <unk> from crime 
 the real tragedy though lies not in the family 's circumstances but in its concern for appearances 
 <unk> for the father is <unk> by the shame of <unk> him in a <unk> 's grave 
 the family moves to another house at night to <unk> <unk> <unk> from neighbors 
 and the successful son wishes his embarrassing <unk> dead 
 as a <unk> of middle-class <unk> the story is <unk> 
 but its <unk> <unk> of cairo life are vintage mahfouz 
 we see <unk> and hear <unk> filled with the <unk> of <unk> advertising their <unk> <unk> with <unk> language <unk> <unk> and the sound of people gathering <unk> in their <unk> and <unk> into the street

 god has not yet <unk> that i should have earnings he tells his worried mother 
 <unk> comes to a bad end but so does almost everyone else in the book 
 if the setting is exotic the <unk> is closer to <unk> 's <unk> <unk> than it is to <unk> nights 
 mr. mahfouz began writing when there was no <unk> tradition in <unk> and he <unk> his work on western <unk> 
 in one sense this limits him unlike a writer such as <unk> garcia <unk> who has a distinctive latin voice mr. mahfouz 's style offers little that can be labeled egyptian 
 but the <unk> of his style also makes his work accessible as the streets of cairo come alive for the western reader as <unk> as <unk> 's london or <unk> 's st. <unk> 
 the thief and the dogs written in N is a <unk> psychological drama <unk> of crime and punishment 
 its <unk> said <unk> is an egyptian <unk> who seeks <unk> in <unk> and killing 
 i am the hope and the dream the redemption of <unk> he says in one of many interior <unk> 
 later he recalls the words of his marxist <unk> the people theft the <unk> fire 
 said 's story reflects the <unk> of socialism under <unk> whose <unk> rule replaced the <unk> <unk> in N 
 by N mr. mahfouz 's <unk> had <unk> or become <unk> as it has in said 
 his <unk> dream of <unk> a life of badly aimed bullets by <unk> the real <unk> the rich dogs who <unk> on the poor leads only to the death of <unk> and eventually to his own 
 cairo 's <unk> <unk> also has gone gray 
 here the city is dark and <unk> with <unk> said has left his jail cell only to enter the larger prison of cairo society 
 while the theme is compelling the plot and characters are not

 the thief and the dogs is a <unk> work the first <unk> novel in <unk> but it is likely to <unk> western readers

 the story of a playwright 's stage debut <unk> in <unk> <unk> in the manner of <unk> 's the sound and the <unk> 
 but the device <unk> more than it <unk> 
 buried in the work is a <unk> on the <unk> of art and on the struggle for integrity in an unfair world 
 but again the themes get <unk> in mr. mahfouz 's <unk> <unk> 
 the <unk> of his later work reflects both an appetite for new <unk> and the hazards of art in the arab world 
 mr. mahfouz has been <unk> and <unk> for questioning <unk> and <unk> peace with israel 
 <unk> his message has helped him endure 
 art says the playwright in <unk> song is the <unk> for the action that an <unk> like me is unable to take 
 <unk> song gives <unk> of a cairo that has become so much <unk> since his youth when as he once said the poorest person was able to find his daily bread and without great difficulty

 norwood partners limited partnership of boston said it may make a tender offer for some or all of phoenix technologies ltd. 's common shares 
 norwood <unk> phoenix a <unk> maker of software for personal computers has had substantial losses in the past two quarters 
 its stock which was as high as $ N a share has been trading under $ N a share recently 
 yesterday it closed at $ N a share up $ N in national over-the-counter trading 
 in a securities and exchange commission filing norwood said it 's part of a group that holds N phoenix technologies common shares or a N N stake 
 norwood has made no detailed plans but it has engaged in talks with other shareholders the filing said 
 phoenix declined to comment 
 norwood is controlled by daniel l. barnett and paul a. <unk> both officers of <unk> <unk> capital management inc. a small boston money management firm 
 also involved in the group is robert f. angelo formerly phoenix 's senior vice president field operations who left phoenix at the beginning of october 
 mr. angelo was described in the filing as a consultant to <unk> 
 weirton steel corp. said it reached a tentative agreement on a <unk> labor contract with the independent steelworkers union covering production and maintenance employees 
 the agreement subject to approval of union members would cover about N workers 
 the tentative agreement provides for wage increases of N cents an hour <unk> to sept. N N and for increases of N cents N cents and N cents an hour effective jan. N N N and N respectively 
 it also provides for benefit adjustments including a partial restoration of <unk> and holidays as well as <unk> changes to increase productivity 
 ground zero of the hud scandal is the secretary 's discretionary fund a <unk> pot used to fund projects that were n't approved through normal hud channels 
 jack kemp wants to abolish it 
 instead congress 's idea of reform is to increase this <unk> fund by $ N million 
 and transfer control of much of it to capitol hill 
 the hud scandals will simply continue but under new <unk> 
 after one of the most amazing debates we 've ever seen on the cable channel <unk> the house voted N to N on wednesday to order $ N million in spending for a new jersey arts center a michigan library and N other pet projects out of the same discretionary fund that was supposed to have been so abused during sam <unk> 's tenure 
 hud has no paper work <unk> on N of the projects none of the others has been approved and not a single congressional hearing has been held on any of them 
 however four are in the michigan district of rep. bob <unk> the chairman of the house subcommittee that writes the hud spending bill 
 of course this kind of <unk> congressional <unk> is called <unk> service by members while the same kind of <unk> <unk> at hud is labeled influence peddling 
 unlike those awful republican consultants members do n't profit directly from hud projects 
 they merely collect campaign contributions from developers that help keep them in office 
 the N pet projects were discovered buried in the appropriations bill for hud and some other agencies after it returned from a conference committee that was called to resolve differences between the house and senate versions 
 conference committees are breeding grounds for <unk> 
 they are often closed to the public and no minutes are taken 
 members find it easy to doctor legislation by slipping in special provisions that could never survive in the cold light of day 
 in this case the members <unk> themselves 
 rep. <unk> recently purchased an <unk> building lot on the island 
 this is slightly adapted from remarks oct. N by former secretary of state george p. <unk> to an <unk> gathering at the stanford business school where he has returned to the faculty 
 i was struck a couple of years ago by the <unk> effort in the <unk> 
 we had <unk> during the year an estimated $ N billion street value of cocaine 
 i do n't know how much got through 
 nobody has any credible estimate 
 the gnp of the <unk> is probably somewhere between one and two billion dollars 
 so you get an idea of the leverage there and elsewhere that our market for drugs has brought about 
 i welcome the emphasis that is now being put on the drug problem 
 the efforts to get to the people who are <unk> try to <unk> them if they can not be <unk> at least to contain them to educate people to strongly discourage use of drugs by people who are casual users and first users to stop this process among the young all of these things i think are extremely important 
 but i have to tell you that it seems to me that the conceptual base of the current program is flawed and the program is not likely to work 
 the conceptual base a <unk> approach is the same that i have worked through before in the nixon administration when i was budget director and secretary of the treasury with jurisdiction over the customs 
 we designed a comprehensive program and we worked hard on it 
 in the reagan administration we designed a comprehensive program we worked very hard on it 
 our international efforts were far greater than ever before 
 you 're looking at a guy whose <unk> was attacked in <unk> by the drug <unk> so i 'm personally a veteran of this war 
 what we have before us now is essentially the same program but with more resources <unk> into all of the efforts to enforce and control 
 these efforts wind up creating a market where the price <unk> exceeds the cost 
 with these incentives demand creates its own supply and a criminal network along with it 
 it seems to me we 're not really going to get anywhere until we can take the <unk> out of the drug business and the incentives for <unk> out of it 
 frankly the only way i can think of to accomplish this is to make it possible for <unk> to buy drugs at some regulated place at a price that <unk> their cost 
 when you do that you wipe out the criminal incentives including i might say the incentive that the drug <unk> have to go around and get kids <unk> so that they create a market for themselves 
 they wo n't have that incentive because they wo n't have that market 
 so i think the conceptual base needs to be thought out in a different way 
 if i am catching your attention then read a bold and <unk> article in this september 's issue of science by <unk> <unk> on this subject 
 we need at least to consider and examine forms of controlled <unk> of drugs 
 i find it very difficult to say that 
 sometimes at a reception or <unk> party i advance these views and people head for somebody else 
 they do n't even want to talk to you 
 i know that i 'm shouting into the <unk> here as far as what we 're doing now 
 but i feel that if somebody does n't get up and start talking about this now the next time around when we have the next <unk> of these programs it will still be true that everyone is scared to talk about it 
 no politician wants to say what i just said not for a minute 
 the u.s. economy grew at a moderate N N annual rate in the third quarter the same pace as the second quarter despite the worst trade performance in six years the commerce department reported 
 personal spending buoyed by a burst of automobile buying was the main catalyst to the economy 's expansion 
 but trade one of the economy 's main forces in the past few years showed a sharp deterioration 
 imports of goods and services soared while exports were flat 
 some economists found the <unk> <unk> 
 for the past two years the foreign trade sector has been a major <unk> to economic growth 
 you ca n't rely now solely on consumer spending to sustain the economy on a solid growth path said norman robertson chief economist at mellon bank in pittsburgh 
 although the economy showed no change of pace from the second quarter many analysts expect it to slow considerably in the fourth quarter as demand for autos falls partly because of higher prices on models introduced last month 
 many economists think the rise in the value of the u.s. dollar this year will further <unk> progress in trade because it makes exports more expensive and imports cheaper 
 and business investment which slowed in the third quarter according to yesterday 's report is expected to continue to be sluggish 
 a sharp reduction in inflation was by far the <unk> spot in the report on the real gross national product the inflation-adjusted market value of all the goods and services the economy produced 
 an inflation gauge that measures the quarterly change in prices of an array of goods and services slowed its growth to a N N annual rate in the third quarter from N N in the second 
 much of the <unk> came from declining energy prices which have since turned up a bit analysts said 
 consequently michael <unk> undersecretary for economic affairs at the commerce department said inflation probably will edge up from the third-quarter rate in the final three months of N 
 but he said he believes the second quarter 's N N rate will prove to have been this year 's peak quarterly inflation rate 
 generally the bush administration expressed satisfaction with the economy 's progress as it heads into its eighth year of sustained growth next month 
 treasury secretary nicholas brady called the N N pace good solid growth although he said he expects the expansion to slow in the fourth quarter 
 he added inflation is lower than i think people expected it to be and i think that 's good news 
 but administration officials were concerned over the bleak trade report which showed the deficit in the country 's trade of goods and services swelling to a $ N billion annual rate in the third quarter from a $ N billion rate in the second quarter 
 mr. <unk> called it a disappointment but predicted exports will pick up again 
 we were <unk> for the deterioration in net exports said daniel van <unk> vice president of u.s. forecasting at bank of america in san francisco 
 i ca n't believe it will continue he added noting that the economies of the country 's major trading partners are strong and prices of u.s. products are still competitive 
 some analysts also were <unk> by a pickup in the growth of business inventories 
 while a buildup of these stocks adds to gnp it can hurt the economy because a <unk> of <unk> goods can lead to production cuts and layoffs 
 according to the report inventories outside the farm sector grew at an annual rate of $ N billion in the third quarter up from a $ N billion pace in the second quarter 
 manufacturers ' stocks <unk> at an $ N billion annual rate up from $ N billion 
 that suggests there is a little more inventory <unk> than some people expected said edward boss senior financial economist at continental bank in chicago 
 i do n't think it 's anything that 's going to cause a downturn in economic activity 
 but it will slow production 
 devastation from hurricane hugo which <unk> into the southeast coast in late september diminished personal income by about $ N billion the department said but it called the effect on the roughly $ N trillion economy negligible 
 except for the loss from the hurricane all the figures were adjusted for seasonal factors and inflation 
 here are some of the major components of the gross national product expressed in seasonally adjusted annual rates in billions of constant N dollars 
 in the third quarter the implicit price deflator fell to N N of the N average from N N in the previous quarter 
 northrop corp. received a $ N million contract by the u.s. air force for production <unk> and test equipment for the <unk> rainbow <unk> missile

 hudson 's bay co. announced terms of a previously proposed rights issue that is expected to raise about N million canadian dollars us$ N million net of expenses 
 proceeds of the offering will be used to redeem c$ N million of preferred shares and to reduce short-term debt the company said

 the record date is nov. N 
 the company has about N million ordinary shares outstanding 
 on the toronto stock exchange hudson 's bay shares closed at c$ N up N cents

 <unk> is a holding company owned by toronto 's thomson family 
 hudson 's bay said it will redeem N million series <unk> preferred shares on oct. N at a price of c$ N each 
 the move was approved at a special shareholders ' meeting yesterday

 iverson technology corp. was one of the fastest-growing small companies in america until last year 
 the <unk> va. company <unk> computers to keep sensitive military data out of unfriendly hands 
 from N to N its earnings soared <unk> to $ N million on a <unk> increase in revenue to $ N million 
 but in N it ran into a <unk> saw a defense department spending freeze 
 iverson 's earnings plunged N N to $ N million 
 the troubles continued in this year 's first half when profit plunged N N to $ N 
 iverson technology is one of many small defense contractors besieged by the slowdown in defense spending 
 unlike larger contractors with a broad enough base to weather the downturn easily these companies are suffering big drops in business as <unk> specialty <unk> in the massive military market erode or even disappear 
 companies that only recently were thriving find themselves scrambling to survive 
 as their <unk> strategies suggest there is more than one way to respond to a disaster though it 's too soon to tell whether the changes will pay off 
 for many companies the <unk> first response is to cut costs 
 others are trying to find specialty defense work <unk> by the slowdown or new <unk> created by <unk> 
 more <unk> businesses are applying their skills in commercial fields 
 <unk> international inc. which provides professional and technical services to the military is refining its defense niche not retreating from it 
 after <unk> annual earnings over four years to $ N million in N the <unk> va. company posted a N N drop in earnings for this year 's first half 
 in the belief that development of advanced military technology will remain a top defense department priority <unk> last year acquired <unk> <unk> associates a technical and scientific analysis company with contracts under the strategic defense initiative 
 while the sdi <unk> program recently awarded <unk> <unk> two contracts totaling $ N million <unk> 's chairman and founder jack <unk> says he bought the company more for its technology than its customer 
 <unk> inc. an <unk> md. contractor that earned $ N million on revenue of $ N million in N has gone even further in <unk> its military business 
 as orders for its aircraft and <unk> parts <unk> three years of steady growth ended with a N N drop in income in this year 's first half 
 the company hit on a new strategy if the defense department is so intent on saving money why not make money off that trend 
 among the company 's current efforts <unk> old parts at N N of the cost of replacing them 
 <unk> also is selling new parts if needed directly to the military instead of through a prime contractor 
 at as little as one-third of the government 's cost the company is running a program to train army helicopter pilots 
 it is also taking over the maintenance of certain navy aircraft with N N fewer people than the military used 
 in another approach tiny iverson technology is trying to resume its growth by <unk> the new world of commercial products 
 donald iverson chairman says he hopes the company can eventually get up to half of its revenue from commercial markets 
 for now he says we 're looking at buying some small companies with niche markets in the personal-computer business 
 earlier this month mr. iverson agreed to buy exclusive rights to a software system developed by <unk> systems inc. salt lake city 
 the product <unk> an array of functions performed at small to <unk> printing companies 
 mr. iverson says there are N potential customers for the software in the washington d.c. area alone 
 <unk> inc. falls church va. also has acquired some companies outside the military market 
 moreover it 's trying to transfer its <unk> at designing military equipment to commercial ventures 
 a partnership with a <unk> va. unit of shell oil co. recently <unk> a process for producing plastic food containers that wo n't <unk> in microwave <unk> 
 we 're trying to take the <unk> and talent of our engineers and come up with new processes for industry says vincent <unk> <unk> 's chief executive 
 it is an effort to branch out from the government which is very difficult for a defense contractor 
 mr. <unk> should know 
 instead of helping his company in the defense spending slowdown dynamic engineering inc. a troubled subsidiary that makes wind <unk> for the space industry contributed to much of <unk> 's $ N million loss on $ N million in revenue last year 
 in january mr. <unk> sold the unit 
 it was our first acquisition he says and it was a mistake 
 some companies are cutting costs and hoping for the best 
 <unk> corp. a santa <unk> calif. provider of <unk> and <unk> services to the military enjoyed steady growth until this year 
 following a <unk> of earnings to $ N million on a doubling of revenue to $ N million over four years earnings in the company 's fiscal first quarter which ended june N plunged N N to $ N 
 a one-time write-off for <unk> <unk> revenue was partly to blame but so were lower profits from a <unk> contract with the army and delays in getting paid 
 <unk> responded by combining three of its five divisions to reduce expenses and bring more focus to potentially fewer bidding opportunities says lin <unk> <unk> chairman and controlling shareholder 
 it 's evident we 're entering a more competitive era he says 
 <unk> corp. a sherman <unk> calif. defense contractor that earned $ N million on revenue of $ N million in N provides a more dramatic example of cost-cutting 
 the company not only merged three <unk> manufacturing operations but also closed an unrelated plant that makes <unk> devices used in fighter planes and missiles 
 the closing contributed to a $ N million loss in the fiscal first quarter ended july N its first quarterly loss since N 
 our <unk> business has been hurt very badly by the slowdown says <unk> <unk> <unk> 's chairman 
 i would n't say we 're out of the business 
 but we 're not making as many <unk> devices as we used to 
 the growing crowd of japanese investors buying up foreign companies are n't all <unk> businessmen in dark suits 
 <unk> morishita whose art gallery last month became a major shareholder in christies international plc the london auction house is one man who does n't fit the <unk> 
 in japan he 's known in <unk> weekly magazines as the king of <unk> money 
 if nothing else the <unk> 's past has its share of <unk> 
 nearly N years ago mr. morishita founder and chairman of aichi corp. a finance company received a <unk> suspended sentence from a tokyo court for violating a <unk> law and an income tax law 
 he was convicted of charging interest rates much higher than what the law permitted and attempting to <unk> income taxes by using a double accounting system 
 he 's had other <unk> with the law 
 he was arrested though not indicted on at least three other occasions in the <unk> and <unk> for assault and unlawful <unk> for fraud and <unk> of private documents and for <unk> 
 christies says it has had no contact with mr. morishita since the stock purchase but that it 's happy to deal with him 
 we like to make our own judgments about mr. morishita says christopher <unk> christies ' group managing director 
 people have a different reputation country by country 
 mr. morishita is a leading figure among japan 's N <unk> which lend to small companies and <unk> which lend to individuals 
 many of these financiers lend freely often without demanding collateral 
 but the interest rates they charge are often near japan 's N N legal limit says <unk> <unk> a lawyer specializing in loan troubles 
 aichi is a <unk> mr. <unk> says and one of the nasty ones 
 in describing that business in general he says that when the client ca n't repay the loan some <unk> <unk> on like <unk> and even take over the client 's company 
 last month mr. morishita 's new gallery <unk> international ltd. purchased N N of christies for # N million $ N million 
 acquired from <unk> holdings u.k. ltd. a company owned by australian financier robert holmes a court the stake was apparently the first of its kind for <unk> an entity separate from aichi 
 and the acquisition which made <unk> one of christies ' top five shareholders left many people wondering who this man was and what his intentions were 
 we 're an investor mr. morishita says sitting back in his <unk> gallery filled with some N <unk> and <unk> 
 in the long run the stock prices will go up 
 it 's not clear whether <unk> plans to buy more shares 
 but christies mr. morishita insists is happy to see him become a long-term <unk> 
 mr. morishita considers himself a <unk> of art 
 in N years of collecting <unk> and japanese paintings he has acquired N items he says enough to persuade him to start a museum next year 
 he says he spent $ N million on his art business this year 
 a week ago his gallery racked up a $ N million <unk> at a sotheby 's auction in new york buying seven works including a <unk> 
 he makes <unk> judgments says <unk> <unk> the art gallery 's manager and mr. morishita 's secretary for more than seven years 
 mr. morishita 's main business certainly appears to be thriving although he wo n't disclose numbers 
 according to <unk> data bank ltd. which tracks company earnings aichi 's revenue rose N N to N billion yen $ N million in the year ended february 
 revenue doubled from two years ago 
 that is if the company reported results <unk> 
 the <unk> <unk> a japanese daily last month reported that aichi revised its tax calculations after being challenged for allegedly failing to report all of its income to tax authorities over a two-year period 
 the tokyo regional taxation office declines to comment and mr. <unk> the <unk> 's secretary says the problem simply resulted from a difference of opinion over what was considered income 
 the small <unk> mr. morishita comes across as an outspoken man of the world 
 stretching his arms in his <unk> white <unk> and <unk> his black shoes he <unk> a <unk> about the way to sell american real estate and boasts about his friendship with margaret thatcher 's son 
 but when asked what exactly he does in business he immediately takes <unk> 
 are you stupid he <unk> 
 you should know what questions to ask to get people to answer 
 not many people know the details of mr. morishita 's business but it 's a source of rumors about <unk> dealings 
 when a small company goes <unk> for instance the <unk> weekly magazines are often quick to link the demise with aichi 
 mr. morishita <unk> at those stories as well as the ones connecting him to the japanese <unk> 
 he says he has never even <unk> with <unk> 
 the seventh child of a store owner in aichi <unk> mr. morishita started out in the textile business

 the los angeles-based bank holding company disclosed last friday that it had taken a huge $ N million provision for loan losses at the arizona bank the result of the state 's worsening real-estate market 
 in yesterday 's report first interstate said its bank in texas also reported a loss of $ N million for the quarter 
 but it said that its consumer banks in oregon california nevada and washington performed well during the quarter and that nonperforming assets at these banks declined by N N over the year-ago period 
 private-sector union contracts signed in the third quarter granted slightly lower wage increases than those signed in the second quarter but wage increases still are running above last year 's levels 
 the labor department said wage settlements in the third quarter called for average annual wage increases of N N in the first year and N N over the life of the contracts 
 the last time parties to these settlements negotiated wage increases mostly in N or N wages increased an average of N N a year over the life of the contracts 
 if this pattern continues the labor department said N will be the first year that the measure has shown an increase since N when the department started <unk> <unk> contracts with those that replaced them 
 this reflects the restoration of wage cuts in the steel and other industries as well as higher wages granted nurses who work in health-care facilities 
 settlements reached in the first nine months of N called for wage increases averaging N N in the first contract year and N N annually over the life of the contracts the department said 
 for all of N union contracts provided for N N wage increases in the first year and N N over the life of the contracts 
 in the second quarter contracts called for increases of N N in the first year and N N over the life of the contracts 
 the figures exclude <unk> payments and cost-of-living adjustments so the actual wage increases may have been bigger 
 about N N of the workers covered by contracts signed in the first nine months of year get <unk> payments about N N are covered by cost-of-living <unk> 
 unions covered by one or other provisions generally settled for lower percentage wage increases 
 the labor department said wage increases in manufacturing industries continue to be smaller than those in other industries 
 for all six million workers under major collective bargaining agreements regardless of when they were signed wage increases in the first nine months of N averaged N N including cost-of-living adjustments 
 an enormous <unk> has succeeded where the government has failed he has made speaking filipino respectable 
 the N <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is a character who stars in the children 's television show batibot 
 he speaks only in filipino 
 batibot which started in N as a hybrid of the u.s. program <unk> street has developed into a <unk> philippine effort 
 radio programs and books have followed the daily television show 
 in the process batibot an <unk> filipino word meaning strong or <unk> has become a powerful advocate of the use of the filipino language 
 it <unk> on ordinary young <unk> that there 's nothing to feel <unk> about in using their own language says <unk> david a sociologist and host of a popular television talk show 
 when we started the program six years ago the use of filipino was deemed <unk> by the <unk> middle class says <unk> brown the program 's <unk> 
 now she says it 's no longer an issue 
 the success of batibot stands in marked contrast to many academic and government attempts to promote filipino as a national language 
 filipino once known as <unk> is <unk> <unk> the <unk> language spoken in a part of the country 's principal island of luzon 
 resistance to a national language comes primarily from members of the country 's elite who generally prefer english 
 but while <unk> <unk> are quick to cite the logic in using a language as widespread as english they are often slow to reveal that they are <unk> against filipino say advocates of the native language 
 for the middle and <unk> class filipino is <unk> says <unk> <unk> a <unk> professor at <unk> city 's university of the philippines 
 there 's also <unk> 
 other opponents of filipino come from <unk> regions 
 they argue that their own <unk> should have equal weight although recent surveys indicate that the majority of the country 's population understands filipino more than any other language 
 there are seven major <unk> and more than N <unk> in the country 
 what <unk> to speak is an emotional mine field in the philippines 
 it is entrenched in the country 's colonial bonds to the u.s. in philippine class structure in the regional <unk> of its people and in its island geography 
 as they did when the philippines was a colony of the u.s. teachers for the most part teach in english even though it is a foreign language for most philippine children 
 as a result they often speak one language at home another at school 
 mrs. brown calls the <unk> cultural <unk> to filipino a language <unk> 
 the issue has been <unk> for years 
 it does n't take much to <unk> an intense debate 
 when president <unk> aquino whose command of filipino is <unk> announced last year that the language would be used in official communications there was an <unk> from many legislators who continue to conduct debates mostly in english 
 but many proponents of filipino see resistance to the language finally crumbling 
 they believe the media including batibot have played a crucial role 
 according to chief <unk> <unk> <unk> batibot does n't set out to advance the cause of filipino 
 it 's not as if we 're teaching language per <unk> he says we 're just using it 
 these days batibot is produced in a converted <unk> on a <unk> budget of $ N a one-hour segment 
 it is shown <unk> on two of the country 's five networks 
 with an audience totaling more than N batibot consistently ranks in the country 's <unk> <unk> <unk> programs 
 but advertising revenue is inadequate 
 <unk> there are threats that the program will <unk> 
 batibot lacks the polish of <unk> street 
 sound stages echo 
 acting sometimes falls flat 
 there are only two large <unk> in the program <unk> <unk> and a <unk> named <unk> <unk> 
 but the production is the equal of any local program 
 and the show 's creativity makes up for any technological deficiencies 
 the program is n't afraid to tackle controversial topics such as nuclear weapons and the environment 
 not that the language war is won even on batibot

 black & decker corp. said it agreed to sell its <unk> chemical <unk> unit to orkem s.a. a french chemical company for $ N million 
 <unk> is the first emhart corp. unit to be sold as part of the <unk> manufacturer 's effort to reduce debt and consolidate operations after it acquired emhart earlier this year 
 black & decker said it plans to put other emhart units on the block in the future with the goal of raising $ N billion in net proceeds 
 black & decker <unk> emhart from the takeover bid of <unk> limited partnership last march by agreeing to acquire the maker of door <unk> and <unk> tools for about $ N billion 
 the move significantly expanded black & decker 's product line but also significantly increased its debt load 
 the acquisition boosted black & decker 's ratio of debt to total capital to more than N N 
 company officials have said they plan to reduce that ratio to less than N N over the next N N years 
 earlier this year black & decker put three emhart businesses on the auction block the information and electronics segment the <unk> electrical assembly business and <unk> <unk> 
 the three units had combined N sales of about $ N million 
 the three units contributed about a third of emhart 's total sales 
 in addition black & decker had said it would sell two other undisclosed emhart operations if it received the right price 
 <unk> is one of the previously <unk> units and the first of the five to be sold 
 the company is still negotiating the sales of the other four units and expects to announce agreements by the end of the year 
 the five units generated sales of about $ N billion in N almost half of emhart 's $ N billion revenue 
 <unk> posted N sales of $ N million 
 our divestiture program is on schedule and we remain confident that we will achieve our stated goal of over $ N billion in net proceeds said <unk> d. <unk> black & decker 's president and chief executive officer in a statement 
 the sales are an attempt to <unk> investor concern about black & decker 's increased debt burden from the emhart purchase 
 the company 's stock plunged when it first announced that it planned to acquire emhart 
 the company maintains that it does n't expect emhart to contribute to earnings for about another N months

 the company did n't announce the sale until after the close of the market

 <unk> in the budget being <unk> by the house-senate conference committee is something that looks <unk> and <unk> like a duck 
 it 's a <unk> tax on mergers 
 congress has decided to raise $ N million by charging companies $ N for the honor of filing the required papers under the hart-scott-rodino law 
 ever since the bad days of big is bad antitrust enforcement this law has required that anyone proposing a merger must make a filing describing the effects on all relevant markets 
 the <unk> filing is then reviewed and any antitrust concerns usually met 
 typically <unk> is used now to give managers of target firms early news of a bid and a chance to use regulatory review as a delaying <unk> 
 the $ N tax would be a small cost in a multibillion-dollar deal but a serious drag on thousands of small friendly deals 
 one especially dangerous aspect to the new tax would be that the proceeds will be used to increase the budgets of the antitrust division at justice and the federal trade commission 
 this amounts to a <unk> for regulators the more <unk> the more they get to keep 
 also as former reagan antitrust chief charles rule has noted this would establish the precedent that the government may charge parties for the privilege of being sued regardless of whether the government <unk>

 michael <unk> N years old was named vice chairman for planning marketing and industry services a new post

 cie. de navigation mixte chairman marc fournier said his board unanimously rejected as too low the $ N billion bid by cie. financiere de paribas to bring its stake in navigation mixte to N N 
 at a news conference mr. fournier accused paribas of planning to pay for the takeover by selling parts of the company whose interests include insurance banking <unk> <unk> sugar and orange <unk> 
 the chairman said his board members including representatives of west german insurance giant allianz ag and french banks credit lyonnais and societe generale hold nearly N N of navigation mixte 's capital 
 mr. fournier said that as navigation mixte chairman he is prohibited by takeover regulations from organizing his own defense or doing anything besides managing current company business 
 but sources said he will be urging his allies to boost their stakes in navigation mixte which is being traded in london and is to resume trading in paris tuesday 
 at the same time he is expected to seek legal and regulatory means of blocking or delaying paribas 's bid 
 for the moment the sources said he has decided against seeking a white knight or organizing a <unk> for paribas 
 mr. fournier said navigation mixte 's N unconsolidated or <unk> profit is likely to be N billion francs $ N million up from N million francs last year 
 that is due mostly to payments from allianz for most of the N N stake it has agreed to acquire in navigation mixte 's insurance business 
 mr. fournier said the <unk> gain would mean nearly twice as high a dividend this year as last 
 if holders avoid <unk> to paribas he added they can expect strong dividends again next year 
 analysts noted that over the past N years mr. fournier has built his company through <unk> stock-market activity and has <unk> off at least three takeover attempts 
 this time however some analysts think he could face a real battle 
 without some unexpected coup de theatre i do n't see what will block the paribas bid said <unk> de <unk> analyst at the brokerage <unk> & cie 
 mr. de <unk> said mr. fournier 's biggest hope was to somehow persuade regulatory authorities to block the bid 
 paribas still needs the <unk> from the commission des operations de <unk> a government regulatory agency but analysts said that is considered likely 
 mr. fournier also noted that navigation mixte joined paribas 's core of shareholders when paribas was <unk> in N and said it now holds just under N N of paribas 's shares 
 once he realized that paribas 's intentions were n't friendly he said but before the bid was launched he sought approval to boost his paribas stake above N N 
 the petition is still pending but mr. fournier <unk> the likelihood of his organizing a takeover bid of his own for the <unk> paribas 
 one big question now is the likely role of mr. fournier 's allies 
 mr. fournier said the large institutions that hold nearly N N of navigation mixte 's capital all strongly support him but some analysts said they are n't so sure 
 allianz for example has said in official comments so far that it will remain neutral 
 paribas is allianz 's lead french bank 
 paribas said monday that it intends to bid to boost its stake in navigation mixte to N N from the N N it already owns 
 the purchase of the additional N N stake is expected to cost more than N billion francs $ N billion 
 paribas says it will offer N francs $ N each for navigation mixte shares that enjoy full dividend rights and N francs each for a block of shares issued july N which will receive only partial dividends this year

 the N tax reform act has nearly eliminated the number of large profitable corporations that do n't pay federal income tax according to citizens for tax justice a nonprofit <unk> research and lobbying group 
 in a study of N of the nation 's <unk> companies the group found that only seven managed to avoid paying federal income taxes last year compared with N in N the last year the old tax rules were in effect and N in N when some of the new tax provisions went into effect 
 moreover N companies that paid no federal income tax from N through N despite billions of dollars of profits ended up paying an average of N N of their income in federal taxes in N 
 the report released yesterday comes as congress is considering a number of special tax breaks only three years after the sweeping <unk> legislation abolished or curtailed many <unk> 
 in the corporate <unk> the N law abolished the <unk> credit scaled back use of an accounting method that allowed large contractors to defer taxes until a project was completed and strengthened the so-called alternative minimum tax a levy to ensure all <unk> businesses pay some federal tax 
 the combination of lower rates and fewer <unk> has meant that the so-called average effective tax rate the rate actually paid of the N corporations surveyed reached N N in N compared with N N in the years from N through N according to the study 
 in addition corporations are now <unk> a bigger share of the tax burden as the authors of the N law hoped 
 corporate taxes paid for almost N N of federal spending in N excluding social security compared with less than N N in the first half of the 1980s the study found 
 tax reform is working the study said 
 under the new <unk> law the days of widespread wholesale corporate tax <unk> have come to an end 
 still <unk> co. pinnacle west capital corp. <unk> corp. illinois power co. media general inc. santa fe southern pacific corp. and gulf states utilities co. did n't pay any federal income tax last year although they <unk> a total of $ N billion in profits the group said

 the lobbying group used publicly available information to calculate each company 's domestic profits and its federal income tax payments 
 this is the fifth year citizens for tax justice has released a study on corporate tax bills 
 earlier reports which revealed that as many as N companies were avoiding income tax legally have been credited with helping <unk> efforts to overhaul the tax code 
 but even though companies are paying more taxes many are still paying less than the statutory rate the report said 
 and N companies paid effective tax rates of below N N of their income 
 while the overall picture is very encouraging significant corporate tax <unk> continues the study said

 the big three u.s. auto makers posted losses in their core north american automotive businesses for the third quarter and expectations of continued slow vehicle sales and price wars are casting a pall over the fourth period 
 the strongest sign of the big three 's woes came from ford motor co. which said it had a loss in its u.s. automotive business for the first time since N 
 ford predicted fourth-quarter net income will fall below the year-earlier level partly because of a likely $ N million charge from the sale of its steel operations 
 the bleak automotive results were offset by strong earnings from some <unk> operations 
 still the combined profit of ford chrysler corp. and general motors corp. fell N N to $ N billion from $ N billion a year earlier excluding a one-time gain of $ N million at chrysler from the sale of mitsubishi motors corp. stock 
 the last time all three companies reported north american automotive losses was in the recession year of N 
 yesterday 's announcements helped spark a midday wave of program selling in the stock market 
 gm 's common closed at $ N a share down N cents ford fell N cents to end at $ N and chrysler eased N cents to $ N all in new york stock exchange composite trading 
 the market 's <unk> reflects the gloomy outlook in detroit 
 as japanese auto makers gained market share the big three with gm in the lead slashed north american production and launched a retail discounting <unk> 
 the price war peaked in the third quarter as big three factory discounts climbed to more than $ N a vehicle according to industry officials 
 gm probably had the heaviest incentives said robert s. miller chrysler 's chief financial officer 
 we all did what we had to do to stay within sight of them 
 but the costly efforts did little to slow japanese market gains and domestic car sales have plunged N N since the big three ended many of their programs sept. N 
 gm ford and chrysler have already cut fourth-quarter u.s. output plans an estimated N N from N levels 
 if sales do n't pick up the cuts will go deeper and incentives will <unk> again 
 ford which has long <unk> of its ability to weather a downturn saw earnings take a beating 
 the no. N auto maker blamed incentive costs and reduced production both the result of a substantially weaker u.s. market for a N N drop in net to $ N million or $ N a share on revenue of $ N billion 
 nearly all the decline came in ford 's u.s. automotive operations 
 the dearborn mich. auto maker ran a loss of $ N million on <unk> and marketing cars in the u.s. a deterioration of $ N million in that line from the N quarter 
 ford managed to show a profit for the quarter primarily because of earnings from overseas auto operations and financial services 
 a year earlier ford reported record net of $ N million or $ N a share on revenue of $ N billion 
 in the latest nine months ford earned $ N billion or $ N a share compared with $ N billion or $ N a share 
 the u.s. automotive loss was a sharp reversal for a company that had <unk> off N consecutive quarters of improved earnings until the N second quarter 
 but david n. <unk> vice president finance insisted that cost-cutting and tight production capacity will make results better in this downturn than in prior <unk> when ford had net losses 
 still mr. <unk> said ford expects the u.s. economy to weaken through the end of N causing weaker sales and production 
 as a result fourth-quarter profit will come in below N results although the drop wo n't be as sharp as the N N third-quarter decline he said 
 part of the drop will come from an anticipated charge of as much as $ N million from the proposed sale of its rouge steel unit 
 in the N fourth quarter ford had net of $ N billion or $ N a share 
 chrysler 's operating profit fell to a <unk> $ N million or N cents a share its lowest quarterly total in seven years 
 its $ N million or $ N a share gain from the sale of N million mitsubishi shares made net $ N million or $ N a share 
 sales were flat at $ N billion 
 the results include record quarterly earnings of $ N million from chrysler financial corp 
 a year earlier chrysler 's net was $ N million or N cents a share 
 mr. miller said costs of incentives caused a moderate loss in the highland park mich. company 's north american car and truck business 
 he said the loss was n't that much different from ford 's $ N million loss on u.s. automotive operations but he declined to be specific 
 mr. miller said chrysler spent an average of $ N a vehicle on its incentive programs in the third quarter compared with about $ N a vehicle a year earlier a <unk> mark at the time 
 he said chrysler is no longer sure of its forecast for industry car and truck sales of N million in the N model year 
 consumers he said are <unk> at higher prices on N cars especially after seeing the <unk> prices on N models 
 in the nine months net was $ N billion or $ N a share including the gain from the mitsubishi stock sale compared with $ N million or $ N a share after a charge of $ N million or N cents a share for plant closings in the N period 
 sales rose N N to $ N billion from $ N billion 
 heavy losses in north american auto operations sent gm 's net tumbling to $ N million from a record $ N million 
 <unk> gm does n't issue separate quarterly earnings for the north american automotive business 
 but analysts estimated that gm had a loss of as much as $ N million on domestic vehicle operations 
 an N N drop in north american factory sales of cars and trucks cut into revenue and rebates to dealers and customers more than offset gains from price increases on N model vehicles delivered during the period a gm spokesman said 
 but gm 's results also illustrate the increasing diversity of its operations 
 in one breakdown gm attributed half of its net to its two big technology units electronic data systems corp. and gm hughes electronics corp 
 meanwhile gm said overseas auto operations are on track to exceed last year 's record full-year net of $ N billion 
 the diversified operations helped gm build its cash reserves exclusive of its financial subsidiary to $ N billion as of sept. N a N N increase from a year earlier 
 this cushion could come in handy if gm has to trim fourth-quarter north american production schedules more than the already scheduled N N 
 under the circumstances it wo n't be easy for gm to exceed its record N fourth-quarter net of $ N billion the spokesman acknowledged 
 that means it 's unlikely the company will <unk> last year 's $ N billion full-year profit even though net for the first nine months was up N N to $ N billion on revenue of $ N billion 
 it earned $ N billion on revenue of $ N billion in the N nine months 
 there are two versions of measure for measure on stage at the alley theater here 
 one is a strong vigorous portrayal of shakespeare 's play the other is director gregory boyd 's <unk> of <unk> <unk> rock <unk> on old vienna 
 measure for measure is one of shakespeare 's problem plays so named because it does not fit neatly into a category such as tragedy comedy or history 
 its <unk> and uneasy <unk> of the serious and the comic is no doubt one reason why it is very much in <unk> with directors just now 
 last season hartford stage director mark <unk> mounted a production at lincoln center and currently two other productions one just closed at the old globe in san diego and another now at the seattle rep <unk> with mr. boyd 's 
 in the play the duke of vienna <unk> over the <unk> of his subjects and turns over the rule of the city to the <unk> angelo hoping he can set things right 
 when angelo <unk> that the young man <unk> has made his <unk> pregnant before he could <unk> her angelo <unk> <unk> <unk> to death 
 when however <unk> 's sister <unk> a <unk> in a <unk> goes to angelo to plead her brother 's case the <unk> <unk> immediately falls in love with her and in a supreme act of <unk> demands that <unk> yield up her virtue to him in exchange for her brother 's life 
 meanwhile the duke who set the original scheme in motion appears on the scene <unk> as a <unk> and becomes involved in a series of <unk> that has everyone <unk> the worst possible outcome until the duke <unk> a last minute <unk> for all concerned 
 for the alley production scene designer peter david gould has arranged a stark but extremely effective set featuring a <unk> platform of <unk> boards that <unk> into the audience 
 when the action requires a prison cell consisting of an <unk> wire <unk> rolls forward on iron wheels on the platform 
 in the play 's major scenes mr. boyd demonstrates that he has a firm grasp of the <unk> dynamic 
 when <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> her brother <unk> <unk> <unk> in his cell explaining the price she has been asked to secure his freedom when <unk> and the <unk> duke philip <unk> <unk> to <unk> angelo and when <unk> <unk> jefferies a woman <unk> by angelo <unk> him with his past <unk> the performers bring the dramatic high points to life with intense energy and intelligence 
 at such moments mr. boyd makes it clear that he has the capacity to be a superior <unk> of shakespeare 
 when however he decides to be modern or more accurately when he decides to be trendy the results are far less satisfactory 
 mr. boyd is of the <unk> school that believes one must find modern parallels or <unk> to make shakespeare accessible to today 's audiences 
 it 's a valid approach but it puts a heavy burden on the director to show an uncommon degree of <unk> and taste 
 in his measure mr. boyd has <unk> the <unk> and <unk> of vienna whom angelo is supposed to bring under control by converting them into <unk> <unk> <unk> and heavy metal types with a strong emphasis on leather chains and <unk> <unk> 
 loud rock music <unk> all the scene changes even those in the <unk> 
 when <unk> is arrested he is brought on stage <unk> except for the <unk> on his <unk> and <unk> 
 when the <unk> <unk> jack <unk> visits the <unk> to inform <unk> of her brother 's fate <unk> not only <unk> the mother superior on her rear but brings along a <unk> companion <unk> <unk> not in shakespeare 's script to <unk> <unk> 
 meanwhile the <unk> <unk> <unk> allen <unk> dressed in black leather and a prominent <unk> <unk> in enough <unk> gestures and <unk> <unk> to launch a space probe 
 the problem here is not in the concept but in its lack of discrimination 
 the <unk> at one point for example of a list of <unk> <unk> <unk> ranging from jim bakker and <unk> helmsley to <unk> <unk> <unk> is a bid for a cheap <unk> <unk> of mr. boyd 's ability 
 despite the excesses however the <unk> for the production has many more <unk> than <unk> 
 what 's more it represents an important step for the alley theater 
 measure for measure is mr. boyd 's first <unk> <unk> as the theater 's new artistic director 
 he succeeded pat brown who was fired by the alley board N months ago 
 her dismissal angered many in the regional theater establishment and led peter <unk> head of theatre communications group to write an editorial in american theatre magazine <unk> the board 
 none of this backlash could change the fact that ms. brown 's regime was <unk> <unk> and <unk> 
 now the alley has moved ahead on both artistic and financial fronts 
 not only is mr. boyd giving the theater a new sense of <unk> and excitement on stage the balance sheet is the best the theater has had in N years 
 as opposed to the $ N million deficit of the N season the N year concluded with a $ N surplus and a $ N cash reserve 
 <unk> last season 's runaway hit steel <unk> helped a lot but so did cost cutting and other measures insisted on by the board 
 only time will tell if mr. boyd can restore to the alley the <unk> it received when its founder <unk> <unk> was at the <unk> of her powers 
 but it is clear he is going to give it a shot 
 democratic leaders have bottled up president bush 's capital-gains tax cut in the senate and may be able to prevent a vote on the issue indefinitely 
 senate majority leader george mitchell d. maine said he intends to use senate procedures to force advocates of the tax cut to come up with at least N votes before they can address the issue 
 and neither democrats nor republicans are predicting that the capital-gains forces can produce enough votes 
 the <unk> requirement will be there and they do n't have the N votes sen. mitchell said 
 they do n't have the votes to get it passed 
 sen. bob packwood r. ore. the leading republican <unk> of the tax cut did n't disagree

 sen. packwood has offered his <unk> package as an amendment to a bill now pending in the senate that would <unk> aid to poland and hungary

 the republicans show no sign of <unk> 
 gop leaders continued to press for a vote on the amendment to the eastern europe aid measure 
 and they threatened to try to <unk> any other revenue bill in the senate with the capital-gains provision 
 this is serious business we 're serious about a capital-gains reduction said kansas sen. robert dole the senate 's republican leader 
 the strategy is let 's vote 
 the republicans contend that they can <unk> a majority in the <unk> senate for a capital-gains tax cut 
 they accuse the democrats of unfairly using senate rules to <unk> a <unk> hurdle 
 democrats counter that the republicans have often used the same rules to suit their own ends 
 the two sides also traded accusations about the cost of the packwood plan 
 democrats asserted that the proposal which also would create a new type of individual retirement account was <unk> with budget <unk> that would lose billions of dollars in the long run 
 republicans <unk> that <unk> revenue estimates were <unk> 
 the packwood proposal would reduce the tax depending on how long an asset was held 
 it also would create a new ira that would shield from taxation the appreciation on investments made for a wide variety of purposes including retirement medical expenses <unk> purchases and tuition 
 a white house spokesman said president bush is generally supportive of the packwood plan 
 marsh & mclennan cos. said it agreed to acquire the rest of <unk> & <unk> a leading west german insurance brokerage firm in which it has held a N N stake for N years

 it 's also the first major sign of the long-awaited consolidation in the european insurance industry as the european community commission moves toward a single market by N

 the expected canadian move has been welcomed by the bush administration even though canada has opposed such u.s. actions as the trade <unk> against cuba the <unk> of <unk> and the military support for nicaragua 's contra guerrillas 
 latin american countries have long urged canada to join the oas in the hopes that it would be a <unk> to the u.s. which for many years <unk> to dominate the <unk> organization 
 even though the u.s. also has supported canadian membership it has n't been a washington priority 
 the fact that we might not side with the americans may be a reason why canada 's membership in the oas has n't been over the years an item high on the u.s. agenda said <unk> <unk> former canadian ambassador to the u.s. 
 the canadian application is expected to be announced in san jose costa rica by canadian prime minister brian <unk> who is attending a <unk> celebration of costa rican democracy

 robert h. knight 's oct. N editorial-page article <unk> violence in comedy movies hollywood you <unk> me is interesting but somewhat <unk> 
 as a fan of older movies from the 1920s on i do not find modern <unk> contain violence sex and <unk> language to any greater degree than other recent movies 
 older movies have plenty of violence though it is portrayed in keeping with the more restrictive social <unk> of the time 
 for example one of my favorite movies is the N british comedy kind hearts and <unk> in which the entire comedy is based on actor dennis price 's <unk> eight titled <unk> all played by <unk> guinness because they <unk> his mother and stand in the way of his acquiring the family title 
 similarly one of the most popular comedy <unk> of the 1930s and <unk> was the murder <unk> 
 the thin man series of movies as well as many others based their entire <unk> appeal on the star <unk> ' <unk> <unk> and <unk> as other characters in the movies were murdered 
 further i think mr. knight made a poor choice in picking a fish called <unk> as an example of the <unk> state of modern comedy movies 
 the specific scene he <unk> in which pet dogs are crushed is somewhat <unk> of the <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> in the old warner <unk> road <unk> <unk> 
 there is no <unk> <unk> <unk> portrayal of the animal 's demise 
 keep in mind that this is the same movie in which a character is <unk> by a <unk> only to pop right back up and <unk> in the window of a boeing N from the outside as it takes off 
 i will be the first to agree that there is much to be found wrong with modern movie making 
 many modern <unk> seem to be <unk> of writing drama or anything else without <unk> <unk> 
 sex and violence are routinely included even when they are irrelevant to the script and high-tech special effects are continually <unk> for good plot and character development 
 in short we have a movie and television industry that is either <unk> or <unk> of making a movie unless it carries a <unk> or r rating 
 hence <unk> amounts of <unk> sex violence and <unk> language are included as a <unk> 
 however these <unk> are not the exclusive property of modern <unk> and i believe mr. knight <unk> when he attempts to link this modern phenomenon too closely to a single category of movie making

 western european leaders who favor <unk> economic and monetary union are adding a new argument to their <unk> the dizzying political changes under way in eastern europe 
 french president <unk> mitterrand european community commission president <unk> <unk> spanish prime minister <unk> gonzalez and others have begun linking the rapid changes in the east to the need to speed up changes in the west 
 they are stressing that the best way for the west to help the east is to move faster <unk> western european economic and monetary unity 
 this would make the <unk> system more attractive to eastern countries they argue and allow greater economic aid and technological know-how to flow from west to east 
 the only response to the challenge being presented to us by the east mr. mitterrand told the european parliament in <unk> yesterday is to reinforce and accelerate the union and <unk> of the european community 
 mr. mitterrand proposed that a conference be <unk> next fall to write a new treaty for the ec allowing a european central bank and that the treaty be ratified by N 
 mr. mitterrand also proposed a separate bank for europe that would channel development money to the east 
 one basis for linking change in the east and change in the west is the notion that <unk> N million eastern europeans with N million western europeans is primarily the task of europeans despite the u.s. 's obvious strategic and economic interest 
 says a european strategist the u.s. tends to look at eastern europe not including the soviet union as europe looks at latin america important but far away 
 but for us in western europe these are europeans next door 
 a <unk> europe implies big changes in 40-year-old military and economic policies 
 there is likely to be a natural division of labor says <unk> <unk> director of the international institute for strategic studies in london with the u.s. more engaged in strategic issues with the soviet union and western europe more involved with specific aid measures for the east 
 the <unk> at july 's economic summit of major industrialized nations of the ec commission as coordinator of western aid to poland and hungary was a first step

 for poland and hungary we need to think about a <unk> economic approach that would force them to price things <unk> in return for removing all our tariff barriers 
 he notes that the marshall plan of u.s. aid to europe did n't just throw money at <unk> europe it also <unk> and opened up those markets 
 the french analysis goes further 
 most of the west 's leaders have finally concluded that we all want perestroika soviet leader mikhail gorbachev 's policy of economic restructuring to succeed says <unk> <unk> security adviser to mr. mitterrand 
 but they have n't yet drawn the operational policy conclusions 
 he adds that with communism <unk> and mr. gorbachev scrambling to <unk> the soviet economy our interest lies in a controlled <unk> a contained nuclear reaction so we need to help him and not just with words 
 managing change he adds will require a lot more aid and a prominent role for the ec especially in dealing with the question of german reunification 
 <unk> de <unk> director of the french <unk> for international relations in paris says it is n't clear what exactly west germany wants 
 any push for a gorbachev vision of a common european home <unk> the eventual <unk> of the ec a <unk> partnership and the withdrawal of u.s. forces would be a very very serious problem he says 
 he doubts a <unk> <unk> state will emerge that would dominate europe but warns of a risk of <unk> change in the heart of the european community from a germany that is too strong even if democratic 
 he adds we and the rest of the ec have to talk to the germans now frankly and raise these future risks with them 
 while many <unk> particularly french ones worry that <unk> and emotional reaction to the changes in the east might lead to dangerous pressures for a <unk> europe or the <unk> withdrawal of american troops mr. roper in london sees a more positive scenario 
 there seems to be a message from moscow there 's a deal on offer he says 
 they want <unk> we wo n't try to undermine or destroy the warsaw pact 
 in return the u.k. and france could keep their nuclear weapons 
 he adds once both sides feel comfortable it should be that much easier to make more progress toward the economic and social reforms that are now starting in the east

 sun a maker of computer workstations reported sales of $ N million for the quarter ended sept. N up N N from $ N million a year earlier 
 in the N period the company earned $ N million or N cents a share 
 sun 's results were slightly better than expectations 
 earlier this month the company said it expected to break even for the quarter on sales of $ N million 
 in a statement scott <unk> sun 's chief executive officer said the company 's performance was hampered by problems tied to the introduction of a major new family of computers in april 
 one of those new computers called <unk> N accounted for nearly half of the N systems sun shipped in the quarter he said 
 more than two-thirds of the systems shipped meanwhile were products introduced in april 
 but problems in manufacturing forecasting demand and getting the bugs out of a new management information system made it extremely difficult for sun to meet demand for its newest computers well into the summer 
 these problems also resulted in sun reporting a $ N million loss for its fourth quarter ended june N 
 mr. <unk> said the issues that hurt sun 's performance earlier this year are now largely behind the firm and he indicated that sun 's profitability should increase throughout the fiscal year 
 sun also reported a record backlog of orders

 two old friends george bush and deng <unk> are trying to limit further damage to <unk> ties 
 but as congress prepares a fresh package of sanctions against beijing the <unk> relationship could get worse 
 the problem for congress will be to weigh what china is saying to its people against the more <unk> message it is delivering to the bush administration 
 in a move apparently aimed at heading off new punitive legislation mr. deng sent an indirect signal to washington via <unk> lee a columbia university <unk> who met mr. deng and other chinese leaders in beijing last month 
 when he met with mr. bush on his return mr. lee says he told the president that the chinese made statements to me that i regard as a first step toward reconciliation 
 the communication mr. lee brought represents the softer line the u.s. has been hoping to hear from chinese officials since the june N massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators in beijing 
 the chinese leader mr. lee informed mr. bush expressed some regret for what had happened in beijing and conceded that china 's officials <unk> some responsibility 
 mr. lee says mr. deng told him we should not mind those who participated in demonstrations signed <unk> materials and went on <unk> strikes 
 mr. deng added says mr. lee that we really made mistakes 
 we must not <unk> our responsibility and we can not just blame the demonstrators 
 mr. lee also reported to the president that in a separate meeting communist party chief <unk> <unk> said the chinese leadership looked <unk> on the students who took part in the demonstrations 
 mr. <unk> also pledged that the chinese red cross would publish very soon a list of those killed 
 and he told the <unk> that china 's leaders were very much concerned about the deaths and had arranged aid for the victims ' families 
 i <unk> my conversations to the white house prof. lee says 
 but he adds i was not acting as a <unk> 
 he says that the chinese never asked him to convey their statements to president bush but that the white house <unk> invited him to do so 
 mr. lee concedes the statements made to him are far different from others being issued in china but attributes that to the fact that the situation in china is very complex 
 according to u.s. sources in beijing the administration hopes mr. deng 's fairly <unk> comments will <unk> congress to be cautious about further sanctions against beijing 
 the president does n't want to have legislative sanctions says a u.s. official 
 but he may not have a choice 
 given china 's <unk> statements to its own people mr. bush may be unable to prevent new sanctions 
 beijing officials have said they will step up the campaign of <unk> and <unk> against those who participated in the demonstrations 
 sentences have been stiff 
 a university student got eight years for participating in the rallies sources in beijing said while an <unk> worker got N years 
 nor has beijing hinted to its citizens that it will publish the <unk> of those killed 
 so far the victims are officially considered <unk> and their families receive no compensation 
 a man <unk> down by a <unk> bullet while cycling to work carries after his death the official <unk> of <unk> his wife says 
 what 's more much of china 's official rhetoric is hostile to the u.s. 
 china frequently <unk> the u.s. embassy for <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a political dissident who took refuge there after the massacre 
 in the u.s. there are still people who want to crush china and interfere in our internal affairs <unk> <unk> china 's new ambassador to the u.s. said as he left for washington last week 
 the house and senate are to begin soon <unk> out an agreement for sanctions legislation 
 it will probably be attached to a state department authorization bill which mr. bush is n't expected to veto 
 a congressional <unk> involved in <unk> the sanctions says they are likely to mirror those mr. bush enacted shortly after the massacre 
 but as legislative action they would carry greater weight and would be more difficult to <unk> 
 measures already in effect that are expected to be made law include a ban on military sales and exchanges a suspension of most <unk> government contacts and a halt to u.s. trade <unk> programs such as the overseas private investment corp. and the trade development program 
 <unk> those sanctions could prompt chinese <unk> 
 if the two sides are n't careful <unk> ties could spin downward out of control says a u.s. official in beijing 
 bush and deng are hoping that <unk> heads prevail 
 the amount of blood surgical patients can <unk> and store before surgery can be increased by the new genetically engineered drug epo 
 epo or <unk> is a protein the human body makes to stimulate the growth of red blood cells 
 a genetically engineered version of the human protein developed by amgen corp. of thousand <unk> calif. recently has been marketed by the <unk> pharmaceuticals division of johnson & johnson 
 a competing version of epo is being developed by genetics institute inc. in cambridge mass 
 the drug is being used primarily to treat <unk> 
 a new experiment reported in this week 's new england journal of medicine involved giving <unk> of amgen 's epo to N patients who wanted to store units of their own blood 
 the patients began receiving epo <unk> about a month before their scheduled surgery 
 they then began donating blood twice a week receiving an epo injection each time 
 if tests indicated a low number of red cells blood was n't taken 
 the <unk> patients donated an average of N units of blood each compared with only N units donated by a similar group of surgical patients who received a <unk> injection 
 the volume of red cells donated by the <unk> patients was N N higher per <unk> the research team representing a number of hospitals and blood banks reported

 tax shelters called individual retirement accounts or iras were created without fanfare on sept. N N but grew beyond expectations as an <unk> to personal saving 
 that labor day in his first major act after succeeding the resigned richard nixon as president gerald r. ford signed the employee retirement income security act 
 pension reform was its main thrust 
 labor and business leaders quoted at the white house rose garden <unk> hailed its provisions for <unk> corporate pension benefits 
 iras were like <unk> there 
 the ira 's conception is <unk> 
 in N then treasury secretary george <unk> with the key support of sen. carl <unk> sought some form of <unk> for the uncovered 
 that year a <unk> group headed by william <unk> in the legislation and regulations division of the office of the chief counsel for the internal revenue service was assigned the task of designing a plan 
 they used the N <unk> plan a pension plan created by a new york congressman for the self-employed as a partial model 
 this team initially called its new model personal retirement account or <unk> 
 but it did n't <unk> 
 so they opted for ira naming it after ira cohen a brilliant irs <unk> who helped them 
 ira himself confirms this account 
 ira rules have been changed over the years 
 one in N raised to $ N a year from $ N the amount a person could put <unk> into the <unk> accounts and widened coverage to people under employer retirement plans 
 this caused an explosion of ira promotions by brokers banks mutual funds and others 
 but in N congress sharply reduced the number of people who could qualify for its benefits and ira <unk> slowed their <unk> growth 
 ira account assets have grown to about $ N billion from $ N billion last year and just $ N billion in N 
 the soviet state bank announced a N N devaluation of the ruble against the dollar for private transactions in an apparent attempt to curb the nation 's rapidly growing black market for hard currency 
 the measure which will take effect next wednesday will create a two-tier exchange rate 
 commercial transactions will continue to be based on the official rate of about N rubles to the dollar 
 but for soviet citizens who travel abroad for business or tourism the rate will jump to N rubles to the dollar 
 tass news agency said the devaluation also will apply to foreigners ' transactions 
 but it did n't elaborate and it remains unclear how far western tourists and foreigners living in moscow will be allowed to benefit from the sweeping rate cut 
 the current ruble rate has long been out of line with the black market 
 as soviet leader mikhail gorbachev has opened up the country to foreign trade the <unk> has become ever greater 
 western tourists in the soviet union who could exchange a dollar <unk> illegally for about four rubles a year ago are now being offered N rubles or more 
 even at such rates black <unk> have been able to make big profits because of the dire shortage of consumer goods here 
 they use dollars to buy western items such as video recorders and personal computers and then sell them at a huge <unk> 
 the going rate for a small personal computer that costs about $ N in the west is anywhere from N to N rubles 
 even a pack of N western cigarettes can fetch N rubles or more 
 with more than N billion rubles in savings accounts and little to spend them on soviet consumers <unk> at the <unk> <unk> prices for such goods but they buy them anyway 
 moscow has already <unk> admitted that the ruble is n't worth much announcing in august that it will pay soviet farmers in hard currency for grain and other produce that they grow in excess of <unk> quotas 
 the <unk> of the official rate should seem obvious to everyone the afternoon newspaper <unk> wrote in a brief commentary on the devaluation 
 the state bank 's move is part of a drive to iron out exchange-rate discrepancies as moscow moves toward making the ruble convertible a goal that soviet bankers and economists say is still far away 
 rumors of an impending devaluation have been circulating in moscow for weeks but the size of the cut took many western bankers by surprise 
 it 's much bigger than we expected said one german banker who asked not to be named 
 the next step which could have a larger effect on businesses will come early next month when the bank for foreign economic affairs is to hold its first auction of foreign currency 
 soviet companies <unk> western currencies to buy equipment and supplies abroad will be able to submit bids 
 plans for the auction which was supposed to take place last spring and become a regular event have been <unk> by a lack of hard currency 
 soviet firms that hold some are unwilling to part with it and joint ventures are n't yet allowed to participate 
 the kremlin also has been unwilling to provide hard currency for the auction using a lot of it instead to finance emergency imports of consumer goods 
 if foreign tourists and businesses could sell their currencies freely at the new better exchange rate that would enable the state bank to increase its dollar reserves and would <unk> up some of the excess rubles in the economy at the same time 
 but the amounts they exchange may be limited most soviet hotels for example demand payment in hard currency from western visitors 
 unless other rules are changed the devaluation could cause difficulties for the people it is primarily meant to help soviets who travel abroad 
 over the past three years thousands of people here have made use of <unk> travel restrictions to get their first taste of life abroad 
 but under current rules they are allowed to change just N rubles into dollars and other currencies for each trip 
 at the new rate that would give them about $ N to travel on 
 it is n't yet clear whether the <unk> limit will be lifted 
 if it is n't the black market for dollars probably will continue to <unk> 
 international business machines corp. made news this summer when it landed an unusual contract to manage all of eastman kodak co. 's <unk> needs 
 but the computer giant appears to have lost a second key contract with kodak to archrival digital equipment corp 
 kodak yesterday confirmed that it has entered negotiations with maynard <unk> digital to manage all of its voice and data communications needs 
 kodak based in rochester n.y. said ibm also had bid for the business 
 ibm is based in armonk n.y 
 the loss is a setback to ibm which pointed to the kodak contract as an example of its success in systems integration 
 that 's an emerging business in which computer makers or consultants provide <unk> communications and computing services to major corporations 
 a kodak spokesman declined to disclose the potential value of the contract which is still in negotiation 
 he said that american telephone & telegraph mci communications corp. rochester telephone corp. and ibm itself would likely be digital 's <unk> on the project 
 when we decided to look outside the company for critical <unk> and communications services we wanted to get the best vendor for that service said paul allen the spokesman 
 that 's why we went with ibm for data center management and now digital for voice and data telecommunications 
 this year is the <unk> anniversary of the federal reserve system and some members of congress think it 's time to take a fresh look at the nation 's central bank 
 after N years there may be a few things that are worth <unk> 
 the regional federal reserve bank <unk> for instance may be out of date 
 in earlier years it may have seemed reasonable to give richmond va. a bank and allow los angeles only a branch of the san francisco bank but times have changed 
 maybe the whole regional system is an <unk> the fed after all is a national central bank 
 some of the would-be reformers however want to restore an arrangement we once had or at least part of it 
 in the beginning the treasury secretary and the comptroller of the currency were both <unk> <unk> members of the federal reserve board 
 but in N when congress was trying to find someone or something to blame for the great depression it decided to drop both the secretary and the comptroller from the board 
 carter glass a former treasury secretary who was then back in congress probably influenced the decision 
 he said that when he was on the board he felt that he had a great deal of power and somehow he did n't think that was a good thing 
 times have changed 
 rep. <unk> <unk> d. <unk> has introduced a bill in congress <unk> by rep. lee hamilton d. ind. that would put the treasury secretary back on the board 
 there is doubt that the change would accomplish much but at least congress as in N would be doing something 
 so far no one has suggested putting the comptroller back on the board 
 nicholas brady the incumbent treasury secretary is of course aware of the proposal and he does n't like it much 
 mr. <unk> has changed tactics dropping the <unk> idea 
 that may have pleased the secretary but h. erich <unk> chief economist of the investment firm of <unk> <unk> & co. suggests that mr. brady may figure he already has all the power he needs 
 like most treasury secretaries mr. brady takes a keen interest in monetary matters of course 
 he was in fact taking an especially keen interest in board matters even before he went to the treasury 
 after the october N market crash mr. brady as a private citizen headed a presidential commission that tried to decide what went wrong and what should be done about it 
 one of the commission 's recommendations was that a single agency probably the federal reserve should coordinate regulation of all financial markets 
 this recommendation might have encouraged a <unk> bureaucrat to try to expand his power but so far federal reserve chairman alan greenspan has n't made a pitch for the job 
 the fed has plenty of responsibilities in times of market turmoil and in N and again in N it appears to have handled them well 
 mr. brady has said he thought government agencies in the latest market drop were better prepared to coordinate their actions but he has left no doubt that he still likes the ideas the commission advanced nearly two years ago 
 in recent weeks moreover mr. brady has joined other administration officials in trying to urge the fed toward lower interest rates 
 the urging <unk> has been <unk> 
 in an interview with the washington post in early october the secretary said the fed may be slightly more interested in curbing inflation than the administration is while the administration may put slightly more emphasis on spurring economic growth 
 at least some economists of course would argue that inflation deserves a lot of emphasis 
 earlier this month the st. louis fed held a conference to assess the system 's first N years 
 <unk> <unk> a <unk> university economist noted that the fed 's record included the longest most sustained <unk> inflation in our history dating from either N or N to N 
 the <unk> argument is an old one but mr. brady on the board or off is surely trying to influence fed policy 
 equally <unk> the treasury secretary has <unk> the administration effort to bring the u.s. dollar down by shopping <unk> for west german marks and japanese yen 
 the treasury can do something on its own but to have any hope of success it needs help from the fed 
 the central bank has been helping but apparently not especially <unk> 
 the fed has been <unk> in foreign currency markets all right but through august at least it appeared to be <unk> the intervention 
 in other words it was offsetting purchases of marks and yen by buying dollars in the domestic money market 
 now <unk> intervention may have some effect 
 when traders see the fed is in the exchange market it may make them <unk> a little carefully for fear of what the central bank may do 
 but it 's generally accepted that <unk> intervention has little or no lasting impact on currency values 
 after august the fed may have stopped <unk> but it 's hard to see much impact on the dollar 
 the dollar is still highly volatile 
 the fed has let interest rates slip slightly but whether the main reason was dollar intervention the gloomy reports on manufacturing employment or the friday N market drop only mr. greenspan and his associates know 
 earlier this year martin <unk> president of the national bureau of economic research argued <unk> that a government that wants steady stable exchange rates might try some steady stable economic policies 
 trying to manage exchange rates to some <unk> level he said would mean <unk> monetary and fiscal policies from their <unk> roles and thereby <unk> excessive inflation and unemployment and inadequate capital formation 
 the more we think about it the more we suspect mr. brady does indeed have enough power where he already is 
 this has been a week of stunning events behind what was once called the iron <unk> and interesting shifts in official american policy toward moscow 
 it has also been a week when <unk> washington has had a high old time <unk> over <unk> reagan 's multimillion-dollar <unk> in japan 
 the latter may seem oddly irrelevant if not downright <unk> given the big picture and the way we have handled it in the nation 's capital has done nothing to <unk> that impression 
 in fact however mr. reagan 's casual <unk> of the office he so recently held raises issues about which americans can actually do something 
 our ability to influence the outcome of events in eastern europe and the soviet union is far more marginal 
 those events continue to move at a rate and in a direction which leave informed commentary let alone policy far in their wake 
 earlier this week soviet foreign minister eduard a. shevardnadze confessed that the u.s.s.r. ignored universal human values by <unk> afghanistan and to put it <unk> engaged in a violation of the abm treaty by building its radar station at krasnoyarsk 
 hungary is no longer a socialist peoples republic the communist party no longer has automatic delegates in the u.s.s.r. 's congress of peoples deputies and egon krenz was not backed unanimously by his fellow party <unk> when he took over as east germany 's new maximum leader 
 all of that is just for <unk> or so the hundreds of thousands of eastern europeans in the streets seem to hope and are certainly demanding 
 of like though lesser note secretary of state james baker put the administration <unk> behind perestroika and glasnost and therefore behind mikhail gorbachev in a pair of carefully <unk> <unk> over the past week or so 
 and last but not least president george bush now views the changes in eastern europe as absolutely extraordinary and believes that mr. krenz ca n't turn the <unk> back in east germany because the change is too <unk> as he told the new york times 's <unk> apple jr 
 in other words after some highly visible <unk> and public airing of differences the administration has come down on the side of those who believe that what we are <unk> from berlin to <unk> is a good thing to be welcomed rather than a new thing to be feared or viewed with <unk> 
 all of this is what history will note assuming that events do n't make it seem a bad joke when the record of this time is put down 
 for journalists however who write what they <unk> view as history 's first draft this has also been a week to give a lot of space and time to ron and nancy 's sales appearance in japan on behalf of a communications giant and its controversial founder 
 it has been a <unk> transaction this <unk> away of the prestige of the republic 's highest office 
 the japanese <unk> has <unk> up at least $ N million the japanese government has put up just about as much or so it is reported and at least one estimate puts the total <unk> at $ N million 
 all of which has enabled those of us in washington who enjoy <unk> in such things to go into high public <unk> as mr. apple and i did the other night on abc 's <unk> 
 <unk> away we raised what i still think were all the right issues and landed more than one hard blow but at the end of the affair there was just the <unk> nagging worry that we had been aiming at the wrong target 
 as one of his defenders so <unk> put it president reagan was simply doing what he had always done before his election and some would say thereafter as well 
 he was performing for pay and why should anyone expect anything more 
 primarily because there 's more to the matter than ronald reagan 's personal values or lack of them 
 selling the presidency for a mess of <unk> is not so much a devaluation from the <unk> of public life today as it is a reflection of the <unk> of public standards 
 the theme song for the 1980s has been anything goes and it has been <unk> with <unk> from wall street to some of the highest <unk> of <unk> 
 there are those who say that this is nothing new that america has always suffered from a bad case of <unk> when it comes to the <unk> between what is <unk> and what is practiced 
 there is evidence to support that view 
 <unk> years ago william james wrote to <unk> wells the moral <unk> born of the exclusive <unk> of the <unk> <unk> success that with the <unk> cash interpretation put on the word success is our national disease 
 but if it was the national disease in N it is today the national <unk> 
 if there is no law against it do it 
 if the law leaves <unk> use them 
 if there is no moral prohibition that <unk> <unk> it full speed ahead 
 and if you are caught or if people complain simply argue that everyone does it or no one said i should n't and <unk> it out 
 as a last <unk> when all else has failed and you are <unk> <unk> for having disappointed those who trusted you but deny having actually done anything wrong 
 see for instance jim bakker 's remarks upon being sentenced to prison this tuesday for <unk> the <unk> 
 consider the troubling <unk> between mr. shevardnadze 's speech of <unk> this week and the <unk> defense of everyone concerned with the iran-contra affair 
 the soviet foreign minister publicly concedes that his government violated <unk> of behavior in afghanistan and just plain <unk> about the radar station 
 we have people in high place still lying through their teeth about iran-contra and that apparently is n't going to change 
 for that matter those long ago identified as <unk> are still given <unk> hearings in the press 
 that is the key to the current national disease 
 no one seems willing to hold anyone in public life to a standard higher than the <unk> construction of the law 
 the <unk> media <unk> hunt about some politician 's private <unk> notwithstanding the general <unk> is to offer a version of the old <unk> who am i to judge 
 thus no standards no judgment and no values 
 you are mad because he 's making so much money say president reagan 's defenders 
 no we ought to be mad because he has <unk> the office we gave him <unk> it in the service of private gain just as we ought to be mad that public officials lie through their teeth play <unk> games about their activities or to steal a phrase make public service a private trough 
 i 'm not going to be <unk> into <unk> to any of this president bush told mr. apple in this week 's interview 
 he was referring to the absolutely extraordinary events in eastern europe and it is a <unk> position 
 but there is no defense at all for the <unk> of the 1980s 
 we did n't <unk> into it we <unk> and slipped down the long <unk> and now we have as its <unk> symbol a former president <unk> for a foreign <unk> 
 or perhaps that is a <unk> symbol for the united states of N everything for sale nothing of real value 
 mr. carter is a political <unk> who heads a television production firm 
 cineplex odeon corp. directors said the company 's chairman and chief executive <unk> drabinsky is considering bidding N million canadian dollars us$ N million to acquire the company 
 the board said mr. drabinsky and vice chairman <unk> <unk> are negotiating financing before offering c$ N a share to acquire all of cineplex 's shares outstanding 
 the directors added that the two executives have n't reached a final decision to proceed with a bid and that until an offer is made the board will continue seeking higher offers from other bidders 
 the directors said if messrs. drabinsky and <unk> mail an offer to shareholders by nov. N it will reimburse them a maximum of c$ N million for expenses related to a bid 
 we consider that his bid is an acceptable bid said <unk> <unk> spokeswoman for the independent directors ' committee appointed last may to <unk> and review bids for the company in the wake of a dispute between mr. drabinsky and cineplex 's major shareholder mca inc 
 mca and cineplex 's other major shareholder <unk> financier charles bronfman and his associates have agreed to tender their holdings to an offer by mr. drabinsky unless a higher offer is made by another bidder 
 mca holds half of cineplex 's equity and N N of its voting rights through restricted voting shares while bronfman interests hold about N N of the company 's equity 
 ms. <unk> said the committee had received other bids 
 she declined to identify other bidders but said mr. drabinsky 's offer is all cash and it 's for all of the company 
 several cineplex analysts have speculated that outside bids received by the committee were either <unk> low or for only part of the company 
 all this has really established is that mca and the <unk> have agreed on a price at which they can be bought out said <unk> <unk> an analyst with <unk> <unk> in los angeles 
 if a bid <unk> at that price shareholders will have every reason to be glad but the question of financing still remains 
 last april mr. drabinsky and a group of financial backers planned to acquire up to N N of cineplex for c$ N a share from bronfman associates 
 mr. drabinsky who would have had the right to vote those shares for two years said the purchase subsequently rejected by regulators was aimed at consolidating his control of the company 
 mca strongly opposed the drabinsky group 's move 
 the directors did n't indicate the source of financing for mr. drabinsky 's new proposal but said mca and the bronfman associates agreed in principle to buy for $ N million and then lease back to cineplex its <unk> theater complex in universal city calif. if mr. drabinsky succeeds in an offer 
 this is being done at the suggestion of mr. drabinsky and to accommodate him to facilitate his financing arrangements ms. <unk> said 
 in addition the directors said if a bid by mr. drabinsky is successful cineplex expects rank <unk> plc to acquire the N N of cineplex 's film house unit it does n't own and provide mr. drabinsky with additional loan financing 
 michael <unk> rank 's chief executive said the british theater chain 's total involvement would n't exceed $ N million but declined to give a breakdown between the loan financing and the proposed film house purchase 
 cineplex shareholders responded <unk> to yesterday 's announcement

 some of america 's biggest trading partners gave a quick <unk> to a u.s. proposal to <unk> world trade and reduce <unk> subsidies 
 in geneva where world trade talks are being held under the general agreement on tariffs and trade or gatt the european community called the u.s. proposal a step <unk> 
 and japan 's minister of agriculture <unk> and <unk> told a committee of japan 's parliament that washington 's proposal was <unk> and that tokyo would continue to heavily subsidize its rice farmers 
 the u.s. in a far-reaching plan submitted to the geneva meeting tuesday proposed curbing price support subsidies within N years and eliminating export subsidies within five years 
 u.s. officials said the plan was flexible and was intended as a <unk> approach for gradually removing <unk> subsidies 
 but the ec reacted <unk> arguing that the proposal 's main aim is to destroy the common agricultural policy the ec 's $ N <unk> price support program 
 the american proposal is not an adequate basis for negotiation the ec said in a statement 
 ec officials say they are <unk> that the u.s. has set a specific timetable and is insisting on the elimination of export <unk> not just reduction 
 ec agriculture commissioner ray <unk> said the u.s. plan calls into question the agreement reached by world negotiators last april in geneva seeking substantial <unk> reductions in agricultural support and protection 
 u.s. deputy trade representative <unk> katz replied that the proposal was entirely consistent with the april accord 
 he said he was surprised by the ec 's reaction calling it <unk> even <unk> 
 the u.s. proposal also was criticized by <unk> developing countries who said that the u.s. made no special <unk> for poor nations 
 while many experts argue that <unk> nations would eventually become <unk> in a free-market system the poorest nations are likely to need help in the meantime 
 ambassador katz said the u.s. was open to discussing particular problems of developing countries 
 the u.s. administration said its plan would allow considerable flexibility in determining how and when the <unk> goals would be achieved 
 the u.s. argues that its plan would ease the transition to <unk> agriculture trade by converting certain <unk> barriers into tariffs that together with existing tariffs then would be phased out over N years 
 but the ec is strongly opposed to converting agricultural supports into tariffs 
 the new u.s. package also says countries could temporarily raise tariffs on certain products if they experience an unusually heavy volume of imports 
 it would establish procedures to prevent countries from using health and <unk> rules to <unk> trade <unk> 
 seeking to <unk> european concerns u.s. agriculture secretary <unk> <unk> said in washington that the new u.s. plan would n't put farmers out of business but would encourage them to grow what the markets desire instead of what the government wants 
 the ec with a population of N million has N million farmers while the u.s. with a population of about N million has only two million farmers 
 japan 's objections to the u.s. plan center around its desire to stay <unk> in rice a <unk> food even though foreign producers are far more efficient

 under the agreement which had been widely expected bell atlantic would be buying control data 's customer base and its approximately N u.s. maintenance facilities in about N cities 
 however control data would continue to provide maintenance services for customers of its <unk> product line 
 the unit represents a small portion of <unk> control data 's overall <unk> business which last year posted sales of about $ N million 
 earlier this year the company sold a similar unit in europe for about $ N million 
 lawrence perlman control data 's president and chief operating officer said the maintenance business no longer fits into the company 's strategy to be a data solutions company 
 thomas <unk> president of bell atlantic 's customer services division said the acquisition would give the company 's <unk> <unk> unit added expertise in the increasingly sophisticated workstation and high-end mainframe technologies 
 two recent decisions by federal courts cast judges in the odd role of telling authors how they should write history and <unk> 
 these decisions deserve more attention than they have received from scholars and from journalists as well 
 russell miller 's bare-faced messiah the true story of l. ron hubbard is a <unk> of the founder of the church of <unk> 
 mr. hubbard who died in N <unk> the <unk> on his <unk> to his church which licensed them to new era publications a <unk> corporation 
 in N new era sought a permanent injunction to restrain henry holt & co. from publishing bare-faced messiah on the ground that mr. miller 's quotations from mr. hubbard infringed the <unk> 
 the publisher argued in response that the fair use statute permits <unk> for purposes such as criticism comment news reporting teaching <unk> or research 
 district court judge pierre leval denied the injunction on the ground that new era had failed to make its claim within a reasonable time the doctrine lawyers call <unk> 
 as for the merits judge leval said that mr. miller had written a serious book of responsible historical criticism 
 <unk> <unk> the judge believed was justified in order to prove points the author had asserted about mr. hubbard <unk> <unk> <unk> and other <unk> <unk> that could not be <unk> demonstrated without use of mr. hubbard 's own words 
 the <unk> judge leval wrote should not be required simply to express conclusions without defending them by example 
 in such circumstances <unk> interests <unk> the interests of the copyright owner 
 but judge leval felt <unk> by an earlier decision of the second circuit court <unk> a <unk> of <unk> salinger to quote from mr. salinger 's personal letters 
 he distinguished the two cases in salinger judge leval noted the quotations were for the purpose of <unk> the <unk> rather than of proving points about the subject 
 still the salinger decision created a strong <unk> against fair use of unpublished materials 
 judge leval <unk> concluded that a few of mr. miller 's quotations from mr. hubbard 's unpublished <unk> because they were not necessary to prove historical points failed the <unk> test and therefore infringed copyright 
 but the proper remedy judge leval said lay in a suit for damages not in an injunction 
 the case went on appeal to the second circuit 
 in a decision in april of this year judge roger <unk> joined by judge frank <unk> agreed on denying the injunction and did not doubt that bare-faced messiah was a serious work but rejected judge leval 's argument that the public interest in <unk> could outweigh the <unk> of copyright 
 we conclude the two judges wrote that <unk> is the sole bar to the issuance of an injunction 
 had the suit been filed in time they said bare-faced messiah would have been <unk> 
 this was too much for james oakes the court 's chief judge 
 in a powerful separate opinion judge oakes further distinguished the salinger case by pointing out that a living person like mr. salinger had privacy rights that did not apply to a dead man like mr. hubbard 
 i thought that salinger might by being taken in another <unk> context come back to <unk> us 
 this case <unk> that concern 
 decisions by the second circuit itself judge oakes continued had recognized that public interest in the subject matter and the <unk> in particular cases of <unk> quotations are vital components of fair use 
 and the injunction judges <unk> and <unk> would so readily have granted had new era sued in time 
 <unk> of the book judge oakes observed would operate as a prior restraint and thus involve the first amendment 
 moreover and here judge oakes went to the heart of the question responsible <unk> and <unk> constantly use primary sources letters <unk> and <unk> 
 indeed it would be irresponsible to ignore such sources of information 
 now scholars in <unk> their responsibility do not claim the right to <unk> every collection of papers that bears upon their topics of investigation 
 and of course they agree that people can impose restrictions on the use of their papers whether in their own <unk> or as donated or sold to <unk> 
 but in the bare-faced messiah case the author found most of his material in court records or via the freedom of information act 
 and when responsible scholars gain legitimate access to unpublished materials copyright should not be permitted to deny them use of quotations that help to establish historical points 
 judges oakes and leval understand the requirements of historical <unk> 
 judges <unk> and <unk> do not appear to have a clue 
 yet at the moment they are the judges who are making the law 
 as matters stand the salinger ruling torn from context and broadly <unk> is controlling 
 if an author quotes more than minimal amounts of unpublished <unk> materials as the salinger decision had it he deserves to be <unk> 
 the courts have not defined minimal amounts but publishers i understand take it to mean about N words 
 the bare-faced messiah decision strikes a blow against the whole historical enterprise 
 a second decision handed down in august by the court of appeals for the ninth circuit is another blow against <unk> 
 <unk> malcolm a professional writer on psychiatric matters wrote a series of articles for the new yorker later published in book form by <unk> under the title in the <unk> <unk> 
 the articles were largely based on interviews ms. malcolm had taped with jeffrey masson a <unk> who had served as projects director of the <unk> <unk> 
 mr. masson then brought a libel suit against ms. malcolm the new yorker and <unk> 
 as a public figure mr. masson had to prove <unk> and as proof of <unk> mr. masson contended that <unk> quotations <unk> to him by ms. malcolm were in fact <unk> 
 the quotes could not be found on the tapes and the two judges who decided the case for ms. malcolm and her publishers conceded that for the purpose of their decision we assume the quotations were deliberately altered 
 for all <unk> and most journalists this admission would have been sufficient to condemn the malcolm articles 
 but judge arthur <unk> joined by judge cynthia <unk> hall took the <unk> position that it is perfectly ok to <unk> quotations so long as a judge finds that the <unk> do not alter <unk> content or are rational <unk> of <unk> remarks 
 in his <unk> dissent judge alex <unk> observed that when a writer uses <unk> marks in reporting what someone has said the reader assumes that these are the speaker 's precise words or at least his words <unk> of <unk> and you know and <unk> error 
 while judges have an obligation under the first amendment to <unk> freedom of the press the right to deliberately alter quotations is not in my view a <unk> of a free press 
 ms. malcolm for example wrote that mr. masson described himself as the greatest analyst who ever lived 
 no such statement appears on the tapes 
 the majority cited mr. masson 's remark it 's me alone against the rest of the <unk> world as warrant for the malcolm fabrication 
 but as judge <unk> noted the context shows that mr. masson 's me alone remark referred not to his alleged <unk> in his profession but to the fact that his position on a particular issue was not shared by anyone else 
 ms. malcolm had mr. masson describing himself as an intellectual <unk> 
 again no such statement appears on the tapes 
 the majority decision contended that the phrase was a rational interpretation of mr. masson 's <unk> of himself as a private asset but a public liability to <unk> <unk> and that in any case it was not <unk> 
 judge <unk> found the <unk> entirely <unk> and writes that for an academic to refer to himself as an intellectual <unk> is a devastating admission of professional dishonesty 
 these were only two of a series of <unk> that had in judge <unk> 's words the cumulative effect of making mr. masson appear more arrogant less sensitive <unk> more <unk> and less in touch with reality than he appears from his own statements 
 as robert <unk> wrote in a review of ms. malcolm 's book mr. masson emerges as a <unk> <unk> and in the end a <unk> fool 
 but it is not <unk> malcolm who calls him such his own words reveal this psychological profile 
 we now know that the words were not always his own 
 there is one <unk> rule of journalism john <unk> has said 
 the writer must not <unk> 
 should the green light judges <unk> and hall have given to the fabrication of quotations become standard practice it will notably reduce the value of journalism for <unk> and for citizens 
 as judge <unk> put it to <unk> the right to deliberately <unk> what someone else has said is to <unk> the right to lie in print 
 masson has lost his case but the defendants and the profession to which they belong have lost far more 
 the historical profession will survive these decisions 
 perhaps in time the supreme court will correct them 
 but writing history is tough enough without judges <unk> throwing obstacles in the scholar 's path 
 mr. <unk> is albert <unk> professor of the <unk> at the city university of new york and a winner of <unk> prizes in history and <unk>

 legal <unk> in america have a way of assuming a <unk> significance far exceeding what is involved in the particular case 
 they speak volumes about the state of our society at a given moment 
 it has always been so 
 in the 1920s a young <unk> john t. <unk> <unk> to be a guinea <unk> in a test case sponsored by the american civil <unk> union to challenge a ban on the teaching of evolution imposed by the tennessee legislature 
 the result was a <unk> trial <unk> <unk> cultural conflicts in american life between the smart set whose spokesman was <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> whom <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> 
 few now recall the actual outcome <unk> was convicted and fined $ N and his conviction was reversed on appeal because the fine was excessive under tennessee law 
 so it was with the <unk> case a generation later when <unk> <unk> became a <unk> rod for the <unk> of the cold war and <unk> attitudes toward the new deal he had served 
 his trials aroused public <unk> out of all proportion to the rather <unk> secrets he allegedly had passed to soviet intelligence 
 and so it seems to be with the case of elizabeth morgan the washington d.c. plastic surgeon jailed in a child custody case for refusing to reveal the <unk> of her daughter 
 dr. morgan has just emerged from the d.c. jail after more than two years ' <unk> for <unk> of court a <unk> to her many supporters 
 to the rest of us the case is a <unk> 
 it is what lawyers call fact intensive 
 it presents no great issue of legal principle no <unk> question of family law or the law of <unk> 
 instead it turns on the disputed and <unk> facts of who did what to whom 
 it is difficult if not impossible for anyone who has not <unk> over the thousands of pages of court <unk> and <unk> to have a <unk> opinion on the underlying merits of the controversy 
 certainly i do not 
 so we must look elsewhere for an explanation of the unusual power this case has <unk> over the minds of many not just in washington but elsewhere in the country and even the world 
 i suggest that three themes have come together in the strange case of dr. morgan 
 the first is that it represents an intense battle in what james <unk> used to <unk> as the war between the <unk> 
 but although <unk> did so gently and <unk> many of dr. morgan 's supporters have taken <unk> 's <unk> title the male animal quite literally 
 the <unk> of the <unk> aroused by the case <unk> to its <unk> importance in the war that <unk> accepted as an <unk> part of the human condition 
 a second theme is the <unk> of social class and race in the public reaction to the morgan case 
 dr. morgan is a highly educated white professional who attended some of the best schools 
 as members of the black <unk> in congress asked during the debate on the legislation that freed dr. morgan does anyone seriously believe that if she were an <unk> black <unk> woman congress would have rushed to pass a private relief bill <unk> her 
 or that the president would have <unk> to sign the bill out of <unk> for her plight 
 to ask those questions is to answer them 
 finally the case of dr. morgan gave congress an opportunity to act with <unk> <unk> and to engage in one of its favorite <unk> <unk> the district of columbia government 
 the local government is <unk> in the eyes of many residents for a variety of reasons and congressmen read the same newspapers and watch the same tv <unk> as other people in the area do 
 <unk> the d.c. government is <unk> for members of congress who do not have to answer to their own constituents for it 
 congress is <unk> from acting on such great issues of the day as the federal budget deficit 
 yet a bill tailored to the interests of a single individual passed congress with almost <unk> speed before the judicial process had run its course and indeed while the morgan case was awaiting a ruling by the appellate court 
 the morgan case thus tells us much more about the current state of sex class race and politics in our society than it does about the facts of dr. morgan 's particular situation 
 it may stand as a <unk> for how wide and deep the divisions in that society continue to be however we try to deny their existence

 in the bidding war for public service co. of new hampshire united illuminating co. raised its proposed offer to one it valued at $ N billion from $ N billion apparently <unk> all other bidders 
 the bids remain subject to evaluation by the federal bankruptcy court <unk> ps of new hampshire 's reorganization 
 they are also indirectly subject to approval by the state of new hampshire where residents fear soaring rates to pay for the cost of reorganization 
 each of the four parties bidding for ps of new hampshire proposes a complex financial package to satisfy creditors and shareholders and also proposes a formula to limit rate increases to satisfy the state 
 the new round of bidding would seem to complicate the decision making for judge james <unk> the bankruptcy judge overseeing the case because the company 's stockholders unsecured creditors and regulators each are currently backing different plans 
 in addition some of the proposals are so close that <unk> issues such as timing may play a more important role 
 the unsecured creditors agreed in principle to support new haven <unk> united illuminating 's new bid 
 they previously had backed an internal reorganization plan proposed by ps of new hampshire 
 all of the bidders <unk> full payment including interest to secured creditors 
 united illuminating 's plan however offers more for unsecured creditors

 in addition they would receive some $ N million in payments for interest since then 
 mr. <unk> said that by next july they would have accrued unpaid interest equal to $ N million

 mr. tucker N years old is currently vice president and chief operating officer of bell atlantic 's <unk> telephone unit 
 mr. tucker will succeed <unk> j. <unk> N who will hold the newly created position of chairman of the international unit until his retirement april N 
 richard breeden had n't noticed that his new desk had just four telephone lines and one phone 
 it was after all only his second full day as chairman of the securities and exchange commission 
 but the lack of lines became painfully apparent 
 as the stock market <unk> into a 190-point free fall on oct. N mr. breeden found himself <unk> around the sixth floor of the sec from his desk where the new york stock exchange was on an open line to his assistant 's office where the commodity futures trading commission was connected to a third room where a computer monitored market moves 
 with other anxious calls pouring in he recalls i 'd either have to <unk> the new york stock exchange or go out to the secretary 's desk 
 it wo n't happen again 
 now there are more lines connected to the chairman 's office and the <unk> computer has been moved next to his desk 
 it 's all part of a new command center 
 the changes in the office <unk> illustrate mr. breeden 's stance as the nation 's top securities regulator 
 like his predecessor david <unk> he was faced with a crisis in the stock markets soon after coming into office 
 but unlike mr. <unk> who during the N crash damaged himself by saying rather <unk> that the markets might be closed mr. breeden is turning the market drop to his own advantage using it to further his agenda for the sec 
 in an interview and in congressional testimony he repeatedly points to the recent 190-point plunge in the dow jones industrial average the second-largest ever as evidence of the need for congress to give the sec the ability to better monitor leveraged buy-out loan activity by brokerage firms and to track big trades in the market 
 a veteran of another financial crisis the savings-and-loan bailout mr. breeden wants to have the sec regulate securities issued by banks and s&ls 
 more broadly he wants to modernize regulation by eliminating barriers between commercial and investment banking and by helping u.s. financial firms compete in the global market 
 he believes the tax code encourages the use of debt instead of stock and may fuel leveraged buy-outs an area the sec does n't regulate directly but one where it <unk> influence both on wall street and in congress 
 also unlike mr. <unk> mr. breeden appears to be in a position to get somewhere with his agenda 
 as a former white house aide who worked closely with congress he is <unk> in the ways of washington 
 what 's more the coming months likely will offer him the opportunity to obtain his own majority on the <unk> commission enabling him to avoid the <unk> that frustrated his predecessor 
 but mr. breeden a <unk> securities lawyer has <unk> some of the <unk> issues facing the financial markets 
 for instance he has n't stated a clear position on high-risk high-yield junk bonds an area of growing concern as turmoil in the junk market <unk> over into stocks 
 he may be waiting to see the results of several pending sec studies of junk market liquidity and disclosure rules 
 he also has kept a close wrap on the names of people under consideration for the crucial post of enforcement director at the commission a job vacant since the summer 
 mr. breeden 's selection will be <unk> as an important signal about the strength of his commitment to continuing the sec 's <unk> pursuit of insider trading and market manipulation on wall street 
 congress seems likely to let the new chairman have his way for a while 
 members of the senate banking committee know mr. breeden from working on the <unk> bill and the relationship generally remains warm 
 indeed during mr. breeden 's confirmation hearing last month senators asked him to introduce his children three separate times more often than they asked about his <unk> for the job 
 these days mr. breeden is winning <unk> in washington and on wall street for his <unk> role in monitoring the friday-the-13th market plunge and the following monday 's <unk> morning session 
 as a regulator charged with restoring investor confidence mr. breeden avoided making <unk> comments and worked to gather information critical to wall street and to other government agencies 
 not everyone has jumped on the breeden <unk> however 
 some in washington contend that it 's too soon to tell whether mr. breeden will help or <unk> the sec 
 i do n't think this was a real test says one congressional aide 
 it was a fairly <unk> weekend but my sense is if you had n't had richard breeden there it would n't have made much of a difference 
 for some at the sec an agency that <unk> its independence mr. breeden may be too much of a washington insider 
 they note that he has <unk> his office with five photos of george bush one of them featuring the first dog <unk> 
 they worry that mr. breeden also will roll over when told to do so by the white house 
 but mr. breeden already has shown an eagerness to run the sec his way 
 during the monday market rebound a new york exchange spokesman told cable news network viewers that the industrial average had turned down N points 
 stunned mr. breeden turned to his <unk> computer which by then was next to his desk 
 it showed the <unk> up N points 
 sec staffers soon determined that a widely watched stock-market service quotron had <unk> the industrial average 
 mr. breeden instructed sec staffers to inform the network that it was airing the wrong number 
 it was the plunge that did n't happen he says 
 mr. breeden also is trying to use a far more catastrophic event the california earthquake to move another rule change past congress 
 that disaster closed the pacific stock exchange 's stock <unk> operation forcing those options to be switched to other exchanges temporarily 
 though <unk> to most investors the question of whether to list options on more than one exchange has aroused much interest in congress mainly because regional exchanges fear the change could bankrupt them 
 congressmen raised the issue yesterday at a hearing 
 mr. breeden not missing a chance to press his agenda cited the earthquake 
 that event he contended simply shows the <unk> of having listings on only one exchange 
 in a corner of the <unk> new nippon convention center sits mazda motor corp. 's <unk> display 
 the highlight a <unk> control system 
 with the touch of a <unk> drivers can choose from <unk> <unk> mint or <unk> <unk> all <unk> in through the car 's <unk> system 
 the soft <unk> <unk> will improve ride comfort the display <unk> and a proud employee says mazda hopes to move the system out of the lab and into its cars in a year or two 
 welcome to the <unk> tokyo motor show 
 here you can find mitsubishi motors corp. <unk> a live fish <unk> a truck <unk> to an <unk> on wheels and nissan motor co. with its <unk> <unk> whose doors <unk> upon recognizing the owner 's <unk> 
 <unk> motor co. 's <unk> sport vehicle features a <unk> rear <unk> and invites drivers to go back to the nature 
 but this <unk> event the world 's largest display of cars and trucks has its serious side including the first major <unk> of future engines and <unk> systems 
 it 's also the prime <unk> for a country whose world dominance in the industry is increasingly acknowledged and <unk> lies the draw 
 even the biggest auto shows in the u.s. are largely regional affairs but the tokyo show is international 
 virtually every automotive analyst in new york showed up 
 <unk> flights were booked solid this week as motor city executives including ford motor co. chairman donald e. <unk> and chrysler corp. vice chairman gerald <unk> <unk> to see the future 
 even the soviet union came for the first time in N years to show off its <unk> <unk> sedan and its <unk> <unk> <unk> model 
 here 's a <unk> look at what the japanese hosts <unk> and what the foreign visitors saw 
 new technology 
 the hottest displays were items that <unk> passengers from <unk> <unk> and other <unk> of the road 
 these active suspension systems electronically sense road conditions and adjust a car 's ride 
 existing suspension systems try to absorb <unk> but active suspension provides power to counter the <unk> 
 nissan in a <unk> <unk> modestly compares its <unk> active suspension to a <unk> and <unk> the various parts to the animal 's heart brain nerves and blood vessels 
 toyota motor corp. <unk> touted its system in a car that <unk> in half to reveal the suspension 's inner workings 
 nissan says it will introduce its first system next month on the infiniti <unk> luxury sedan and toyota 's <unk> <unk> will go on sale with the suspension device next spring 
 but drivers in the u.s. must wait the japanese for now are keeping active suspension for domestic use only 
 and detroit 's big three auto makers say their systems are still under development 
 in the engine department several companies displayed experimental models that within a decade could provide power equal to today 's engines and yet take up only half the space allowing for shorter <unk> 
 in the so-called <unk> engines which are expected to get sharply higher gas <unk> each <unk> goes up and down only once to provide power 
 by contrast the <unk> in conventional <unk> engines must move up and down twice in each power cycle 
 the <unk> engine displays by toyota and fuji heavy industries the maker of <unk> cars drew plenty of interest from u.s. auto executives who are rushing to develop <unk> engines 
 honda motor co. shows a more conventional <unk> engine in the new accord <unk> model which made its debut just this month in japan only 
 honda says the <unk> engine provides a compromise between the <unk> of a <unk> and the power of a <unk> 
 it is rumored to be bound for a new model in the luxury <unk> line in the u.s. but honda officials would n't comment 
 odd cars funny names 
 there 's plenty of <unk> here but it is n't always clear whether it 's <unk> 
 the show 's symbol is a woman riding on a <unk> not your usual <unk> for speed and <unk> 
 but the sponsors have an explanation through the character associated with a <unk> they say important values such as harmony with nature and aspirations for the future are sought 
 japanese auto makers are known for coming up with funny names but this year the practice seems to have reached a new high or low 
 honda has a tiny <unk> called the <unk> and a slightly larger <unk> the <unk> 
 mitsubishi has a <unk> delivery truck called the <unk> 
 mazda has the <unk> truck and under its <unk> <unk> a <unk> called the <unk> 
 its <unk> carol <unk> is designed with softness <unk> and <unk> 
 but the court <unk> appears to be japan 's smallest car maker <unk> motor co 
 one of its <unk> <unk> is the <unk> <unk> which seats just one person in front and could hold a small child and bag of <unk> in the rear 
 <unk> also has the fellow N the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> 
 the jokes are n't just on the japanese though 
 <unk> <unk> des <unk> renault the french auto maker has a concept car called the <unk> 
 the name is supposed to <unk> <unk> <unk> but in japanese it means <unk> 
 foreign presence 
 foreign auto makers are taking the tokyo motor show more seriously than ever 
 ab <unk> invites <unk> to play the role of the test <unk> by <unk> in a car that <unk> a crash to show just how its <unk> <unk> works 
 hyundai motor co. of south korea has its <unk> exhibit in tokyo 
 general motors corp. is <unk> its first independent display in N years and it includes a <unk> buick station <unk> with <unk> side panels 
 ford and chrysler also have <unk> although theirs are <unk> in a separate room with the <unk> automotive parts section 
 we 've got to get out of the detroit mentality and be part of the world mentality declares charles m. jordan gm 's vice president for design in explaining his <unk> to the tokyo show 
 even so traditional american <unk> is n't <unk> endangered 
 ford officials for example <unk> about their <unk> tokyo grand <unk> racing victory 
 true ford was declared the winner sunday but only after the honda driver who crossed the finish line first was <unk> because it hit another car and <unk> <unk> out of <unk> 
 mr. jordan of gm meanwhile still <unk> japanese <unk> 
 it 's hard for the japanese he says to get a feeling in a car to get a passion in a car to get <unk> in a car 
 regarding your sept. N politics & policy column on the party differences over cutting capital gains or expanding iras why not compromise now and save the public from the coming <unk> congressional political rhetoric that seems to go hand in hand with the process 
 the republicans maintain that a N N capital-gains exclusion will raise revenue in the short term and spur economic investment while the democrats maintain that an increase in the top income-tax rate and expanded iras will raise revenue and spur savings 
 this is a classic example of the old saying the whole is greater than the sum of its parts 
 it 's ridiculous for a family with taxable income of $ N to pay the same N N <unk> tax rate as a family with taxable income of $ N 
 the N N <unk> should apply to all income over the applicable level not just the N N rate adjustment amount 
 it 's equally ridiculous not to provide a capital investment or <unk> tax incentive 
 jeffrey t. <unk> 
 pwa corp. said it plans to sell by spring N all N passenger planes it acquired earlier this year in its N million canadian dollar us$ N million purchase of <unk> inc 
 pwa which recently merged <unk> 's operations with those of <unk> canadian airlines international ltd. canada 's <unk> airline said the proposed sale is part of a revised five-year plan aimed at streamlining its fleet and shedding debt 
 pwa would n't estimate the value of <unk> 's aircraft which include N airbus <unk> and three boeing <unk> 
 but james ireland a miami-based technical analyst with <unk> inc. an aircraft evaluation firm estimated the total <unk> value of the N planes at about $ N million or more 
 mr. ireland said N <unk> aircraft that pwa also said it plans to sell beginning in N have a current <unk> value of about $ N million each or a total $ N million raising <unk> potential proceeds from the aircraft sale to about $ N billion 
 mr. ireland said current demand for used aircraft is strong partly because surging orders for new aircraft have <unk> waiting lists 
 he predicted that pwa would have little difficulty attracting prospective buyers 
 under its revised fleet plan pwa said it will also increase its existing fleet of eight boeing <unk> aircraft to N by N and add four more boeing <unk> by N to the two units that it previously planned to add by next year 
 pwa said two of the boeing <unk> aircraft scheduled for delivery in N would be leased out for two to five years 
 pwa did n't disclose the expected net cost of the fleet overhaul but a toronto-based analyst estimated it at about $ N million us excluding replacement costs for the N <unk> aircraft that pwa plans to sell and purchase costs for as many as N airbus N aircraft that pwa previously ordered 
 i do n't see this as a debt reduction exercise 
 it 's focused on streamlining pwa 's fleet in a bid to cut training and aircraft <unk> costs the analyst said 
 pwa 's long-term debt and capital lease obligations rose to c$ N billion at the end of the second quarter nearly double the year-earlier figure reflecting debt absorbed under the <unk> purchase 
 pwa said it also expects to announce by tuesday whether it will take delivery of all N airbus N aircraft it previously ordered 
 the first five leased units were to be delivered in N 
 this british banking and financial-services group 's investment-banking arm barclays de zoete wedd group announced the following appointments at its <unk> subsidiary barclays de zoete wedd ltd 
 john <unk> N years old was named a deputy chairman 
 mr. <unk> is currently a director at barclays de zoete wedd ltd 
 graham <unk> N was named to the new post of chief executive officer of the <unk> <unk> division 
 <unk> <unk> N was named to the new post of deputy head of the <unk> division and a managing director 
 mr. <unk> and mr. <unk> join <unk> 's from kleinwort benson ltd. where they served as directors 
 the recent bids for united and american airlines have led congress to move with <unk> speed to protect incumbent airline <unk> 
 the house is scheduled to vote today on an <unk> bill that would block for up to N days any bid for N N or more of a u.s. airline even a straight cash purchase 
 transportation secretary sam skinner who earlier fueled the anti-takeover fires with his <unk> attacks on foreign investment in u.s. carriers now says the bill would further <unk> the jittery capital markets 
 texas rep. steve bartlett who has N american airlines workers in his district says the bill is good politics but bad law 
 it is ironic that at a time when america 's partial airline deregulation is being <unk> by governments from new zealand to ethiopia so many in congress favor an <unk> program for airlines that would be more appropriate for the soviet airline aeroflot 
 federal reserve chairman alan greenspan told congress that the fed can wipe out inflation without causing a recession but he said doing so will <unk> some short-term pain and will require reducing the federal deficit sharply 
 mr. greenspan said he and other fed governors <unk> a bill by rep. stephen neal d. n.c. that would require the fed to pursue policies aimed at eliminating inflation within five years 
 such a deadline is <unk> but it would have costs mr. greenspan told rep. neal 's monetary policy subcommittee 
 the fed chief opposed a bill introduced by <unk> lee hamilton d. ind. and <unk> <unk> d. <unk> that among other things would require the fed to disclose all monetary policy moves immediately and increase outside scrutiny of the fed 
 in responding to questions mr. greenspan played down reports of tension between the fed and the treasury over exchange-rate policy 
 what seem to be interpreted as great conflicts are relatively minor issues of tactics he said 
 he did n't elaborate 
 but the fed is n't enthusiastic about treasury efforts to bring down the value of the dollar through intervention in foreign-exchange markets and the treasury is frustrated at the fed 's reluctance to cut interest rates to pull down the dollar 's value 
 mr. greenspan said the inflation rate currently about N N N could be brought down to levels which are close to zero without putting the economy into a recession but i do suspect that there might be some modest loss of economic output 
 in other words economic growth would be lower and unemployment would be higher for a few years 
 but mr. greenspan who has repeatedly said the fed 's goal is to reduce inflation added that whatever losses are incurred in the pursuing of price stability would surely be more than made up in increased output thereafter 
 he warned that fed efforts to <unk> inflation would fail and could produce a major financial crunch unless they are accompanied by a significant reduction in the federal deficit which causes the government to borrow heavily 
 rep. neal 's bill originally called on the fed to reduce the inflation rate by one percentage point a year for five years and to maintain a zero inflation rate thereafter 
 he altered the <unk> to win mr. greenspan 's endorsement 
 even so his bill is given little chance of passage 
 <unk> hamilton and <unk> also have altered their bill dropping a proposal to add the treasury secretary to the <unk> fed committee that makes monetary policy 
 instead the bill simply calls for <unk> meetings between the committee and top administration officials 
 even that met with mr. greenspan 's <unk> because it might subject the fed to a more intensely political perspective and could risk <unk> monetary policy away from long-term strategic goals 
 while each of the <unk> proposals represents only a small step together they would erode the fed 's independence mr. greenspan said 
 mr. greenspan also said that although he favors cutting capital-gains taxes as sound economic policy he would oppose such a move if it would undo the political compromise <unk> in the tax reform act of N and result in higher marginal income tax rates 
 sears roebuck & co. signed a contract with bob vila the former host of the popular public television program this old house to star in a half-hour home improvement show sponsored by the giant retailer 
 the <unk> show slated to start airing by june N marks sears 's entry into the <unk> market of home repair television programs and could bolster sales of its home improvement products 
 in recent months sales of home improvement items have sagged along with sales of other big ticket durable goods 
 the show also signals mr. vila 's return as a television celebrity 
 earlier this year public television station <unk> in boston fired mr. vila after a sponsor <unk> some of his numerous commercial <unk> 
 with mr. vila as host this old house became one of the public broadcasting service 's top N programs airing weekly on about N of the network 's stations and seen by an average of N million viewers 
 but home <unk> inc. an atlanta-based home center chain <unk> when mr. vila started doing commercial <unk> for <unk> home centers a new jersey building supply company that competes with home <unk> in some markets 
 i 'm <unk> about the change said mr. vila whose new syndicated program is called home again with bob vila 
 in an interview mr. vila criticized his old show which is continuing with a new host 
 public tv is in fantasy land he said 
 last season we did a story that involved spending $ N in converting a <unk> house into a bed and breakfast 
 in the new show he said we 're going to spend $ N building a start-up house for a young couple 
 while sears would n't comment on the <unk> over mr. vila 's commercial <unk> it appears to be building a <unk> around mr. vila 's <unk> 
 his contract makes him exclusive spokesman for sears 's home improvement marketing campaigns 
 ogilvy & mather in chicago a unit of wpp group plc will handle the advertising account and <unk> 
 the only other endorsement permitted by the contract involves a series of <unk> home improvement and repair books 
 his other agreements to promote products have expired 
 little matter for mr. vila who complains that public tv never paid me more than $ N a year 
 he said his compensation under the sears contract is a <unk> dollar deal

 the white house has decided to push for changes in pesticide law that are designed to speed the removal of harmful chemicals from the nation 's food supply 
 the proposed changes which are scheduled to be announced today would apply to pesticides and other <unk> found on fresh and processed foods according to federal officials 
 environmental groups have been calling for faster action on dangerous pesticides and may welcome part of the proposal 
 but they are already <unk> to among other things a plan to give more weight to <unk> considerations in evaluating pesticides 
 it 's a tremendous disappointment said <unk> <unk> an attorney with the natural resources defense council 
 allowing the epa to <unk> continued use of a chemical whenever the benefits outweigh the risks is absolutely <unk> to the environmental community 
 the bush administration plans to announce a series of principles and to work with congressional leaders in writing specific legislative proposals that <unk> them 
 the principles would give the environmental protection agency increased authority and flexibility in <unk> pesticides with the aim of enabling the agency to move more quickly 
 there already are proposals pending in congress to overhaul pesticide law 
 moves to accelerate the removal of dangerous pesticides gained new impetus during this year 's <unk> scare when the epa was <unk> criticized for failing to <unk> the possible <unk> a growth regulator used to make apples <unk> and <unk> 
 the agency has since acted to remove <unk> from the nation 's grocery shelves by may N N and the apple industry has said that growers already have stopped using the chemical 
 in addition the principles attempt to eliminate the so-called <unk> <unk> 
 under the <unk> clause which applies to processed food a chemical is banned if it causes cancer in laboratory animals 
 under other laws applying to pesticide use however that same chemical could be allowed to be used on fresh food if it fell within the epa 's <unk> level 
 among other changes the white house wants to 
 give the epa more flexibility to declare a pesticide an imminent hazard and pull it from the marketplace 
 speed up the process for removing a pesticide that is n't an imminent hazard 
 bar states from setting more <unk> <unk> levels for a pesticide once the federal government has set a standard 
 give the epa added discretion to set negligible risk levels for pesticide <unk> in processed food 
 chemicals that exceed these risk levels would be barred but those that fall below these levels would be allowed 
 allow the epa to permit the continued use of pesticides that exceed its negligible risk standard if the benefits of doing so outweigh the cost 
 financial markets took a <unk> break from their recent wild gyrations with stock prices falling modestly bond prices posting tiny gains and the dollar almost unchanged 
 the dow jones industrial average lost N points to N in moderate trading 
 long-term treasury bonds rose slightly despite the <unk> on the market of $ N billion in 30-year bonds offered by the resolution funding corp. as part of the government 's bailout of the savings and loan industry 
 the dollar was barely changed against the west german mark and up marginally against the japanese yen 
 yesterday 's sluggish action was in marked contrast to the <unk> and plunging of stock prices tuesday after the proposed buy-out of ual corp. once again collapsed 
 traders said the stock market 's <unk> moves have prompted many investors to head for the sidelines until it <unk> some <unk> of stability 
 although bond prices were n't as volatile on tuesday trading as stock prices traders nevertheless said action also was much slower yesterday in the treasury market 
 bond investors paid close attention to comments by federal reserve chairman alan greenspan who was <unk> before a congressional hearing but were n't able to extract many clues about the future course of the fed 's monetary policy 
 many analysts are expecting the fed to lower interest rates at least once more before the end of the year 
 investors now are awaiting today 's release of the preliminary estimate of third-quarter gross national product 
 economists predict the report will show economic growth of about N N in the third quarter which would have little effect on financial markets 
 but an unexpected deviation either way could <unk> bond and currency markets 
 in major market activity 
 stock prices slipped lower in moderate trading 
 volume on the new york stock exchange totaled N million shares 
 but advancing issues on the big board were ahead of decliners N to N 
 bond prices inched higher 
 the treasury 's benchmark 30-year issue rose less than an eighth of a point or less than $ N for each $ N of face amount

 a few years ago i was on a panel of journalists that discussed the image of <unk> athletics for an audience of campus information directors and others 
 we <unk> quickly <unk> that not only was the bad rep of big-time college sports <unk> earned but also that it could be corrected 
 competition could be maintained and stadiums probably would remain full if schedules were reduced and the games returned to the students we said 
 comments from the audience reflected widespread if <unk> agreement with those conclusions 
 as the session broke up i was approached by a man who identified himself as the <unk> director of a big ten university 
 i 'd love to see sports cut back and so would a lot of my counterparts at other schools but everybody 's afraid to make the first move he <unk> 
 it 's like the u.s. and the russians nobody wants to <unk> first 
 and so our institutions of higher learning <unk> from scandal to scandal on <unk> and basketball court while the <unk> mount 
 three new books make the point that one large price of the <unk> <unk> show can be the integrity of the schools that stage it 
 they are a payroll to meet a story of greed corruption and football at <unk> macmillan N pages $ N by david <unk> big red confidential inside nebraska football contemporary N pages $ N by <unk> <unk> and never too young to die the death of <unk> bias <unk> N pages $ N by lewis <unk> 
 the pick of the group is payroll it should be required reading for every college president 
 it <unk> how over a period of a dozen years southern <unk> university bought its way to football respectability in the southwest conference only to find itself trapped and <unk> by the <unk> system it created 
 the school was the first in N to receive the ncaa 's death penalty two years without football for repeated rules violations 
 given current <unk> about the university of florida it may not be the last 
 the man who brought the bribe to the dallas school was ron <unk> a flashy sort who came in N to rescue a <unk> program mr. <unk> writes 
 mr. <unk> 's personal style was illustrated by his <unk> a $ N bill to a high-school <unk> board on which other coaches tacked their cards 
 one <unk> working with mr. <unk> was so generous with $ N and $ N bills that prospects sang here comes santa <unk> when he approached 
 paying players at <unk> was no casual operation 
 it involved the athletics director two different football <unk> staffs and school <unk> and governors just about everybody it seemed but donald <unk> the university 's president 
 there 's a <unk> passage in which mr. <unk> having finally learned of the practice <unk> his <unk> to bill <unk> then a university governor and now the governor of texas and oil man edwin cox chairman of the board of <unk> 
 you stay out of it author <unk> quotes mr. <unk> as saying 
 go run the university 
 which was about what mr. <unk> did and quietly until he resigned a few years later <unk> ill health when the stuff hit the fan 
 mr. <unk> drew on <unk> news media coverage of the <unk> scandal and on a university internal investigation 
 mr. <unk> had to do most of his own <unk> on university of nebraska football which is to date high and dry as far as the ncaa is concerned 
 unfortunately he gets low grades as an <unk> reporter relying heavily on what chicago 's late mayor richard j. <unk> called <unk> 
 discrepancies go <unk> in confidential one <unk> claims he received $ N to $ N for his season football tickets while others said theirs brought only a few hundred dollars and when mr. <unk> ca n't <unk> down something like who really owned a car driven by <unk> <unk> doug <unk> he simply <unk> his notes 
 there are <unk> <unk> to supposed romantic <unk> between <unk> players and a <unk> female university employee 
 a serious charge that star <unk> irving <unk> threw the N orange bowl game by intentionally dropping a pass in the end zone is included even though the nebraska assistant coach quoted denied making it 
 still the book produces more smoke than a <unk> <unk> along with a few <unk> especially concerning the use of <unk> 
 dean <unk> a <unk> <unk> former <unk> <unk> that he used <unk> and says other <unk> did too 
 it 's a mystery how this could have escaped the notice of nebraska coaches 
 probably it did n't 
 never too young is a different sort of work focusing on the N death from cocaine <unk> of bias a university of maryland basketball star <unk> for sure pro <unk> 
 while the university was no more to blame for that than for the similar fate of any other student it must bear responsibility for its conduct in the aftermath 
 bias 's coach <unk> <unk> ordered the room in which bias died to be <unk> before the police could arrive the order was n't carried out and the school 's athletics director issued false information about the academic standing of bias and other players 
 those of course were the responses of people with something to hide 
 one <unk> how other college athletic officials would <unk> under the same circumstances

 <unk> of north america inc. a unit of daimler-benz ag paid massachusetts $ N million in taxes bringing to an end a <unk> corporate tax chase 
 officials at the department of revenue had dogged the foreign car maker for taxes owed on business transactions and were proceeding to settle the dispute in court 
 but the check arrived in the mail said stephen kidder massachusetts commissioner of revenue 
 <unk> which had said it did n't owe taxes to massachusetts partly because it sells its cars at a <unk> in baltimore and not in massachusetts did n't explain its change of heart 
 last month <unk> executives approached state revenue officials complaining about bad press the commissioner said 
 the dispute was the subject of a wall street journal article in august 
 the amount covers taxes interest and penalties owed from N when the state began collecting corporate taxes to N 
 <unk> also agreed to pay taxes owed for the years N through N mr. kidder added 
 under massachusetts tax laws corporations must pay N N of estimated profits resulting from business transactions in the state if the company <unk> a variety of <unk> activities including <unk> customer complaints and relations with independent dealerships 
 national convenience stores inc. trying to shake the doldrums in the <unk> business said it will <unk> the merchandise in all of its stores in the next N months to cater better to the neighborhoods around its stores 
 as part of the plan the <unk> company 's N stop <unk> go stores will be <unk> to target black hispanic upscale or core middle-class customers 
 stores in <unk> neighborhoods for instance will carry high-priced wines publications such as <unk> fair <unk> pasta <unk> oat bran <unk> and weight watchers and <unk> products 
 stores in hispanic areas will stock an <unk> of <unk> magazines mexican cooking items and <unk> 
 stores in the company 's core middle-class market will get more frozen and <unk> foods and a greater selection of bottled water 
 <unk> van horn national convenience president and chief executive officer said the move reflects the company 's <unk> that the industry 's poor performance stems from its failure to give customers what they want rather than from increasing competition from gasoline stations and 24-hour grocery stores 
 convenience store merchandise has not kept pace with current trends in consumer preferences he said in a speech at the company 's annual shareholders meeting 
 analysts and competitors said the move reflects a growing need by the stores to expand their customer base beyond the traditional blue-collar worker who <unk> into a convenience store for a <unk> cigarettes soda or beer 
 there are an increasing number of people out there who are <unk> said chris <unk> retail analyst with alex brown & sons of baltimore 
 those are primarily white-collar workers a customer segment that has historically proved <unk> for convenience stores 
 national convenience 's move is likely to be <unk> by other chains though analysts note that <unk> corp. owner of <unk> stores and circle k corp. are too <unk> to roll out such an extensive effort 
 still <unk> said that its franchisees have been targeting their merchandise to their customers for years and that the company has begun to follow suit 
 for instance <unk> has expanded its bottled water selection in some stores and added fresh <unk> in some outlets 
 several months ago it also added black health and beauty aids displays to many stores a spokeswoman said 
 we certainly see an increasing trend toward that she added 
 national convenience said it has tested its new merchandise mix in N stores with favorable results 
 analysts said the company 's effort will be helped by its decision last year to put <unk> <unk> in N stores allowing national convenience to quickly track items that are selling and those that are n't 
 to promote its new strategy national convenience said it plans to spend about $ N million on advertising for the year ending june N up from about $ N million in fiscal N

 the coin is their problem 
 a mint official says the agency offered to clean the coins for its <unk> cost of $ N plus certain other expenses

 after <unk> around for an hour or so the <unk> hot money <unk> out of the cement <unk> where a giant vacuum <unk> away the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> 
 after cooling the coins are then <unk> 
 brooks expects to pay coin wrap a total of about $ N a cost that insurance wo n't cover 
 and while the job is half done brooks is still bitter 
 in fact there 's only one person involved who 's happy and that 's <unk> string president of coin wrap and <unk> of the <unk> solution 
 not only did his company find $ N worth of work but when the approach was suggested mr. string says brooks officials did n't <unk> at me or anything 
 <unk> this summer 's successful and amusing movie about parents and children apparently was only the beginning 
 it seems that every day a new movie opens featuring a child coping with a mother 's death or adoption or aging parents or pregnancy 
 and why not 
 some of our best and most <unk> film makers from <unk> to <unk> to <unk> allen have taken a <unk> from <unk> when it comes to compelling drama there 's no place like home 
 yet too many people working in hollywood today seem to suffer from the <unk> that the drama played out in every home will be interesting to people who live somewhere else 
 this is not the case 
 some <unk> simply are n't worth <unk> in 
 yet there will be people who will <unk> at immediate family a <unk> constructed and offensive movie about adoption 
 these are the sensitive <unk> who can <unk> with and even enjoy hearing about other people 's troubles no matter how <unk> or predictably the sad tale is told 
 written by barbara <unk> co-author of the big <unk> immediate family takes the position that only rich people living in nice houses should have children 
 the film makers have <unk> this offensive idea in pretty packaging 
 everyone is very nice and <unk> the <unk> parents glenn close and james woods and the <unk> couple who decide to give up their baby for adoption mary stuart <unk> and kevin dillon 
 linda and michael ms. close and mr. woods who seem to be pushing N live in a large and <unk> <unk> home in suburban seattle 
 all of their friends have children and they ca n't so now they want a child more than anything perhaps even more than michael wanted his fancy convertible or his <unk> stereo equipment 
 the idea of a <unk> must be <unk> them since the wealthy <unk> of their friends are shown to be <unk> <unk> in therapy by age five 
 having exhausted all modern aids to <unk> linda and michael decide to adopt 
 the actors wear <unk> <unk> to indicate their genuine <unk> for a little one or maybe they 're <unk> commenting on the <unk> of the script and jonathan <unk> 's the accused <unk> direction 
 or maybe they are <unk> by the <unk> musical score when a character <unk> at a major decision her thoughts are revealed by the sound of i can see clearly now 
 the adoption agency insists on introducing the adopting parents to the birth mother so linda and michael pay for pregnant <unk> 's ms. <unk> bus ticket from ohio 
 why in these movies is the <unk> pregnant woman always from ohio 
 i ask this not necessarily as a native <unk> 
 <unk> of course is pretty and smart though <unk> 
 everyone falls in love with everyone else 
 there is some pain when <unk> has the baby and did n't know she would feel like this and wants to keep the baby 
 but in the end everything turns out for the best in the film makers ' <unk> view 
 like lawyers in the hostile takeover field the baby goes where the money is 
 at the other end of the life cycle is <unk> gary david goldberg 's <unk> of the william <unk> novel 
 this picture is about a <unk> son who makes sure that his delayed bond with his father will last by waiting to cement it until just before the old man dies 
 the <unk> emotional style mr. goldberg has <unk> on television 's family ties does n't benefit from <unk> 
 his characters practically <unk> through a vast range of human <unk> like travelers doing N cities in eight days 
 they <unk> only to register little <unk> of <unk> and <unk> of satisfaction like tourists <unk> the sights they 've seen from the window of a bus 
 not even jack <unk> 's expert <unk> makes this trip worth taking 
 so it 's entirely possible that look who 's talking is n't as entertaining as it seems in comparison to the <unk> other films opening now 
 but by comparison this <unk> comedy seems like a <unk> 
 it starts with conception taking the <unk> 's point of view then <unk> to the baby 's point of view 
 bruce <unk> 's best attribute as an actor is his <unk> <unk> voice and that 's all you get of him here speaking for the baby 
 finally there is one family movie that quite <unk> <unk> the <unk> of human <unk> only its stars are bears 
 for the second time in a movie called the bear french director <unk> <unk> demonstrates just how powerful pictures can be 
 <unk> for fire was the first time 
 to be sure one <unk> what kind of man is this who feels <unk> to try to understand the most <unk> <unk> and <unk> in a way that requires the most sophisticated appreciation of <unk> <unk> 
 supposedly he proposed the movie to his producer <unk> <unk> in four lines 
 an <unk> bear <unk> 
 a big <unk> bear 
 two <unk> in the forest 
 the animals ' point of view 
 but then even a great many words could n't <unk> the extraordinary pull of this movie about an <unk> bear who <unk> a parent 
 video tip 
 one of the best movies about the <unk> thing in recent years was raising arizona the N <unk> brothers ' comedy that definitely was not about the folks next door 
 westinghouse electric corp. <unk> on a major restructuring program expects operating margins of more than N N and double-digit per-share earnings growth next year top officers told securities analysts here 
 john c. marous chairman and chief executive officer also said the company expects sales from continuing businesses to rise N N annually through the next three years 
 in N the company earned $ N million or $ N a share on sales of $ N billion 
 since N westinghouse has shed N businesses that it did n't expect to produce N N operating margins while acquiring N businesses 
 in the past N months alone paul e. <unk> president and chief operating officer said the divestiture of $ N million of <unk> <unk> businesses has been more than offset by $ N million in profitable acquisitions 
 westinghouse expects to meet its corporate goals despite a softening in the economy 
 even if the gross national product is either flat or in the growth range of N N to N N we can handle that mr. marous said 
 gnp is the total value of the nation 's output of goods and services 
 a bright spot is the company 's <unk> business which is experiencing a surge of growth for the first time in years 
 mr. marous said the business will achieve higher sales this year than the company 's target goal of N N 
 while westinghouse has n't had a nuclear power plant order from a u.s. utility in about a decade excess capacity is beginning to shrink 
 mr. <unk> said the company <unk> the need for a major boost in <unk> capability throughout the 1990s 
 westinghouse also is well positioned to sell steam <unk> and gas <unk> plants to independent power producers 
 the company 's ability to respond to energy needs world-wide will be enhanced through a recently announced venture with mitsubishi heavy industries mr. <unk> said 
 he said the independent power segment could grow to provide as much as N N of near-term generation capacity adding we expect to supply a significant share of this market 
 westinghouse also expects its international sales to soon grow to N N of total corporate sales from N N last year 
 the company is negotiating with the soviets to build a <unk> king <unk> plant that would produce about N units annually 
 mr. marous said westinghouse would own N N of the facility 
 the deal which will involve an initial $ N million investment was struck with a <unk> he added 
 company officials also said that any gain from the sale of westinghouse 's N N stake in its transmission and distribution venture with the swiss firm of asea brown boveri will be offset by a restructuring charge in the fourth quarter 
 the executives did n't disclose the size of the expected gain 
 capital expenditure in N will rise slightly mr. marous said from an estimated $ N million this year 
 short interest in international mobile machines corp. fell to N shares in the month ended oct. N from N in september

 a proposed <unk> policy for federally funded <unk> researchers may thwart many high-technology new ventures say financiers researchers and university administrators 
 the national institutes of health policy would require researchers to cut financial ties with health-care businesses or lose their government money 
 among other concerns the agency says researchers with business ties are more likely to <unk> findings in order to <unk> new drugs 
 as ties between <unk> and venture capital have <unk> in recent years <unk> fear of abuse has risen 
 but the guidelines could make it impossible to <unk> research says kenneth smith associate <unk> and vice president for research at massachusetts institute of technology 
 the nih is asking grant recipients and others for comments on the proposed guidelines until dec. N 
 after that it will make a final decision on the policy 
 the guidelines could <unk> future arrangements similar to the deal behind <unk> inc. a <unk> mass. start-up says robert daly a managing partner of <unk> associates a venture-capital firm 
 with $ N million he and other investors launched <unk> last year to market a <unk> cure being developed by researchers of the university of california at san diego 
 the researchers who are being financed by the <unk> funds will receive a royalty or percentage of sales if their research yields a commercial product 
 but because the university of california like many other universities shares its royalties with researchers it may <unk> itself from federal funds under the proposed guidelines mr. daly says 
 the high-tech industry is full of the kind of arrangement that the new guidelines would affect 
 for instance commonwealth <unk> inc. a venture-capital concern last month invested $ N to launch <unk> inc. a <unk> mass. concern that will produce pharmaceuticals 
 scientists <unk> <unk> and paul <unk> conducted the initial research at the massachusetts institute of technology 
 while ms. <unk> left mit to head <unk> prof. <unk> will continue to work at mit serve on <unk> 's board and own a small equity stake in the company 
 the <unk> transaction is typical of the way venture-capital firms are approaching the task of <unk> biotechnology research 
 while universities develop the basic research venture capitalists are the ones best positioned to finance its <unk> says <unk> w. <unk> of commonwealth 
 this is the best way to transfer technology straight off the <unk> of universities 
 but the new guidelines could prevent scientists like prof. <unk> from being involved with <unk> such as <unk> venture capitalists point out 
 and if that happens the entire process of <unk> technology to the marketplace could be <unk> they say 
 the stakes in the controversy are large 
 last year venture capitalists spent an estimated $ N million to finance start-up companies in medical and biotechnology businesses according to the national venture capital association a trade group 
 many of the deals involved transactions in which scientific institutions or researchers agreed to <unk> their work in return for an equity stake or royalties 
 in many of these deals venture capitalists had the inside track says lawrence <unk> of <unk> ventures la jolla calif 
 investors were willing to gamble on new technologies because we had exclusive rights to those technologies he adds 
 but under the proposed guidelines all federally funded research will have to be reported publicly so that anyone can capitalize on the work 
 without the exclusivity most venture capitalists wo n't have the incentive to invest in such deals mr. <unk> says 
 last year for example <unk> and others invested $ N million in <unk> <unk> inc. south san francisco calif. to license and develop technology for delivery of drugs to the brain 
 but before <unk> was able to get an exclusive license to the technology the federal register published most of the details giving all of the company 's potential competitors a chance to exploit it mr. <unk> says 
 <unk> eventually acquired exclusive rights to the technology and currently is developing it 
 but says mr. <unk> it was a close call 
 the proposed guidelines could also delay <unk> and force small companies to waste scarce capital entrepreneurs say 
 if <unk> ca n't have early access to research being conducted at institutions we have to <unk> it ourselves or do without the research says ruth <unk> manager of business development at applied biotechnology inc. a cambridge mass. concern 
 <unk> research is both costly and <unk> for a start-up ms. <unk> says 
 for its part nih insists that its guidelines should not <unk> research creativity or technology transfer from the research laboratory to commercial use 
 universities such as harvard and mit should be able to develop a way to act as brokers for the individual scientists says <unk> <unk> who oversees the huge nih grants program as its deputy director for <unk> research 
 nih staff members believe the guidelines are essential to prevent the <unk> of problems that have already begun to surface in scientific ventures 
 not long ago scientists holding stock in <unk> pharmaceutical services inc. were accused of <unk> research to boost the stock 
 many officials are also concerned about companies getting a free ride on <unk> research 
 a congressional <unk> has been investigating the potential abuse from researchers holding stock in companies <unk> their research 
 among other provisions the nih guidelines would prohibit researchers and members of their immediate families from holding stock in any company that is affected by the outcome of their research 
 ms. <unk> the nih administrator says the business and scientific community is <unk> to what the agency merely meant to be ideas for discussion 
 the predictions of <unk> are <unk> she says 
 but when agencies like the nih <unk> guidelines they 've often already <unk> policy veteran scientists say 
 indeed institutions already are taking note 
 on sept. N harvard began circulating a <unk> policy statement that in effect would follow the nih guidelines <unk> 
 the university of california at san francisco is also circulating a memo among its scientific faculty that will restrict contact with the world of business 
 in many other institutions scientists are <unk> contacts with venture investors until the nih policy is settled 
 says mr. daly the venture capitalist it does n't matter whether they call it guidelines or policy 
 the damage is already done

 merksamer jewelers inc. a fast-growing jewelry store chain filed for chapter N bankruptcy-law protection from creditors apparently to speed a management buy-out of the chain 
 the filing made yesterday in u.s. bankruptcy court here follows an agreement by l.j. hooker corp. merksamer 's owner to sell the chain to management for an undisclosed price 
 ge capital corp. a financial services subsidiary of general electric co. is providing merksamer management with $ N million in financing 
 l.j. hooker based in atlanta filed for chapter N protection in august and has also announced its intention to sell its b. altman & co. department store chain 
 l.j. hooker is owned by hooker corp. sydney australia which itself is currently being managed by a court-appointed provisional <unk> 
 l.j. hooker 's planned sale of merksamer is subject to approval by judge <unk> <unk> of u.s. bankruptcy court 
 rumors to the effect that the merksamer chain would file for chapter N arose last week in the jewelry industry 
 at that time sam merksamer president of the chain <unk> denied that his company was about to file 
 mr. merksamer is leading the buy-out 
 according to executives close to the situation merksamer filed for chapter N to speed the sale of the chain 
 one executive said an accord signed by the unsecured creditors of l.j. hooker corp. had frozen in place all of l.j. hooker 's assets 
 the merksamer bankruptcy-law filing appears to <unk> that agreement 
 by filing for chapter N the merksamer chain will only need approval from a bankruptcy judge for the sale not the hundreds of unsecured creditors said this executive 
 the cash from the sale will go to l.j. hooker but the company itself will belong to sam merksamer 
 mr. merksamer and sanford <unk> chief executive of l.j. hooker were unavailable for comment 
 in a statement mr. merksamer described the filing as a legal <unk> but also said that our inability to obtain trade credit combined with a need to ensure that our stores were properly <unk> for the christmas season <unk> our filing chapter N 
 the jewelry chain which is based in sacramento calif. had revenue of $ N million and operating profit of $ N million for the year ended june N 
 for all of this year 's explosive <unk> in stock prices renaissance investment management inc. 's computer sat on the sidelines 
 now it 's on the <unk> 
 renaissance a <unk> money manager began buying stocks again this week with half of the $ N billion that it oversees for clients according to people familiar with the firm 's revised strategy 
 it was the first time since january that renaissance has thought stocks are worth owning 
 renaissance declined to confirm the move but its stock purchases were thought to have begun tuesday <unk> to <unk> with the maturity this week of treasury bills owned by the firm 
 the other half of its portfolio is expected to remain invested in treasury bills for the time being 
 wall street executives said they believed that renaissance 's $ N million buy program was carried out by painewebber inc 
 as reported painewebber bought shares tuesday as part of a customer strategy shift although the broker 's client was said then to have been japanese 
 yesterday painewebber declined comment 
 when it owns stocks renaissance 's portfolio typically is composed of about N <unk> issues to make buy or sell moves the firm <unk> wall street brokerage houses a day or so in advance looking for the best package price to carry out the trades 
 the broker winning the business does n't charge commissions but instead profits by buying or selling for less than the overall package price 
 that puts the broker at risk if it 's trying to buy stock in a rising market 
 in tuesday 's <unk> session the dow jones industrial average fell by N points early in the day but finished with less than a <unk> loss 
 renaissance 's last portfolio shift carried out by goldman sachs & co. was a highly publicized decision last january to sell its entire stock portfolio and buy treasury bills 
 the sell signal which sent a bearish <unk> through the stock market came when renaissance 's computer found that stocks were <unk> compared with bonds and treasury bills 
 at the time the dow jones industrial average stood at about N 
 the dow average now stands more than N N higher while renaissance 's portfolio of treasurys produced a return of about N N through the first three quarters of the year 
 the computer 's <unk> has been painful for renaissance 
 almost any money manager holding stocks has turned in better results while renaissance has played it safe with treasury bills 
 so why does renaissance 's computer like stocks with the dow at N where it closed yesterday when it did n't with the dow at N 
 with the decline in stock prices and continued low or stable interest rates stocks are representing a better value all the time renaissance president frank w. <unk> said yesterday 
 three-month <unk> yields have fallen to N N from about N N at the start of the year 
 stock prices meanwhile are about N points lower than the peak of N reached on the dow industrial average oct. N 
 are those declines enough to signal a partial return to stocks 
 mr. <unk> wo n't say specifically explaining that if there was such a move it would take about three days to complete the loose ends of the transaction 
 during that time a buyer with the clout of a renaissance could end up driving up the price of stocks it was trying to buy if it <unk> its hand 
 but everything is relative to mr. <unk> so stocks in his view can become more attractive in comparison with bonds or <unk> even if shares are more expensive than when they were sold in january 
 our computer model has a certain trigger point he said 
 when the computer says switch renaissance switches 
 the firm has made N previous shifts from one type of asset to another in its 10-year history 
 almost all have involved at least half and often the firm 's entire portfolio as the computer searches for the most undervalued investment category following a <unk> style called tactical asset allocation 
 competing <unk> firms march to their own computer models so some have been partly or fully invested in stocks this year while renaissance has sat on the sidelines 
 as a result competitors say renaissance has been looking for any opportunity to return to the stock market rather than risk losing business by continuing to remain fully invested in treasury bills 
 mr. <unk> confirms some clients have left renaissance but no major ones and the firm has added new accounts 
 david evans who last week resigned as president and chief executive of qintex entertainment inc. for personal reasons just as the company filed for bankruptcy-law protection has been temporarily <unk> to both positions the company said 
 qintex entertainment also said chief financial officer and treasurer jonathan lloyd N years old would join the <unk> board 
 he succeeds roger <unk> who resigned last week saying his participation in evaluating the company 's role in buying mgm\/ua communications co. was no longer necessary 
 mr. evans will stay until a successor is found but not later than the end of the year the company said 
 it was the <unk> mr. evans who had moved into the offices of mgm\/ua and run the company during qintex australia ltd. 's aborted bid for the movie company 
 after mgm\/ua terminated the $ N billion merger because of a dispute over a $ N million letter of credit qintex entertainment which is <unk> by qintex australia found itself facing problems of its own 
 and the relationship between qintex entertainment and the australian company appears to be quickly deteriorating 
 on oct. N qintex entertainment was about to default on a $ N million payment owed to mca inc. in connection with the distribution of a television program 
 qintex entertainment was depending on qintex australia to arrange financing 
 but early on oct. N the second of two hectic days of board meetings mr. evans said he believed qintex australia would n't be <unk> 
 he recommended that the company file for protection under chapter N of the u.s. bankruptcy code before the mca deadline according to a source familiar with the sessions 
 but a majority of the board which includes three members from the australian company <unk> him 
 mr. evans resigned 
 later in the day according to the source the board reversed itself decided to file for bankruptcy protection and asked mr. evans to stay on 
 mr. evans told the board he needed the weekend to think about it 
 mr. evans could n't be reached yesterday for comment 
 last monday qintex australia announced a restructuring plan and said it would sell off assets 
 last week the company indicated it would cut back on the working capital it would supply to qintex entertainment 
 separately a qintex entertainment shareholder filed suit in federal court in los angeles charging qintex australia with misleading shareholders about qintex entertainment 's financial position 
 qintex australia said it had n't seen the suit and could n't comment 
 the sept. N tracking travel column advises readers to charge with caution when traveling abroad because credit-card companies charge N N to convert foreign-currency expenditures into dollars 
 in fact this is the best bargain available to someone traveling abroad 
 in contrast to the N N conversion fee charged by visa foreign-currency dealers routinely charge N N or more to convert u.s. dollars into foreign currency 
 on top of this the <unk> who <unk> his dollars into foreign currency before the trip starts will lose interest from the day of conversion 
 at the end of the trip any <unk> foreign exchange will have to be converted back into dollars with another commission due 
 the card holder will pay the modest N N fee only on the amounts actually needed 
 typically he will be billed only several weeks after the expenditure and then has another couple of weeks before he has to pay the bill 
 in the meantime the money can continue to earn interest for the card holder often more than N N during that float period alone

 mgm grand inc. has agreed to pay $ N million and nearly N million common shares to buy N acres of land along the las vegas nev. strip as a site for its planned <unk> and <unk> resort 
 of the total purchase price $ N million cash and $ N million in stock nearly N million shares would be paid to buy the existing <unk> marina hotel & casino from southwest securities a nevada limited partnership 
 the remaining properties to be acquired are the <unk> country club & golf course a facility jointly owned by ramada inc. of phoenix ariz. and the <unk> family and a small parcel owned by mgm grand director james d. <unk> 
 the purchase price was disclosed in a preliminary prospectus issued in connection with mgm grand 's planned offering of six million common shares 
 the luxury airline and casino company <unk> by investor kirk <unk> and his <unk> corp. earlier this month announced its agreements to acquire the properties but did n't disclose the purchase price 
 the proposed stock offering and issuance of nearly N million common shares in connection with the land purchase will bring mgm grand 's total shares outstanding to N million of which N N will be owned by mr. <unk> and <unk> according to the prospectus 
 in over-the-counter trading mgm grand was bid at $ N a share 
 proceeds from the offering are expected to be used for remodeling the company 's desert <unk> resort in las vegas <unk> certain aircraft of the mgm grand air unit and to acquire the property for the new resort 
 the company said it estimates the desert <unk> remodeling will cost about $ N million and the <unk> of the three <unk> aircraft made by mcdonnell douglas corp. will cost around $ N million 
 mgm grand said the latest stock offering wo n't cover the $ N million or more cost of building the proposed resort and theme park and added it will need to seek additional financing either through bank borrowings or debt and equity offerings at a later date 
 construction is set to begin in early N 
 the resort will include the mgm grand hotel a <unk> <unk> facility that will include N rooms and N square feet of casino space 
 the facility will be marketed toward families and room rates will be between $ N and $ N a night mgm grand said 
 the prospectus did n't include many details about the studio and theme park although conceptual drawings released this month show that it may feature several <unk> areas similar to those found at parks built by walt disney co 
 investors poured $ N billion more into money-market mutual funds in the latest week despite further declines in yields 
 assets of the N taxable funds tracked by <unk> 's money fund report jumped to $ N billion in the week ended tuesday the <unk> <unk> newsletter said 
 assets soared $ N billion in the previous week 
 meanwhile the average yield on taxable funds dropped nearly a <unk> of a percentage point the largest drop since <unk> 
 the average seven-day compound yield which assumes that dividends are reinvested and that current rates continue for a year fell to N N its lowest since late last year from N N the week before according to donoghue 's 
 lower yields are just reflecting lower short-term interest rates said <unk> <unk> <unk> editor of money fund report 
 money funds invest in such things as short-term treasury securities commercial paper and certificates of deposit all of which have been posting lower interest rates since last spring 
 individual investors can still get better yields on money funds than on many other short-term instruments 
 the yield on six-month treasury bills sold at monday 's auction for example was just N N 
 the average yield on six-month cds of $ N or less at major banks was N N in the week ended tuesday according to banxquote money markets a new york information service 
 one way that money fund managers boost yields in a declining rate environment is by extending the maturities of their investments so they can earn the current higher rates for a longer period 
 the average maturity of the taxable funds that donoghue 's follows increased by two days in the latest week to N days its longest since august 
 they 're anticipating further declines in rates and they 're going to get them slowly said walter frank chief economist for the donoghue organization publisher of money fund report 
 average maturity was as short as N days at the start of this year when short-term interest rates were moving steadily upward 
 the average seven-day compound yield of the funds reached N N in late april 
 the <unk> funds are still above N N 
 the <unk> fund in the latest week was dreyfus worldwide dollar with a seven-day compound yield of N N 
 the fund invests heavily in dollar-denominated money-market securities overseas 
 it is currently <unk> management fees which <unk> to the higher yield 
 the average seven-day simple yield of the N funds fell to N N from N N donoghue 's reported 
 the average 30-day simple yield slid to N N from N N and the average 30-day compound yield fell to N N from N N 
 many small investors are facing a double <unk> this year they got hurt by investing in the highly risky junk bond market and the pain is worse because they did it with borrowed money 
 these people invested in leveraged junk bond mutual funds the publicly traded funds that make a habit of taking out loans to buy extra junk 
 it 's a good strategy in a rising market where a N N leveraged portfolio in effect allows investors to have N N of their money working for them 
 the strategy boosts current yield by putting more bonds into the portfolio 
 trouble is junk bond prices have been weak for months 
 thus the leverage has <unk> the funds ' portfolio losses 
 and shares of leveraged junk funds this year have been clobbered even harder than the junk bonds they hold 
 that 's really where the leverage hurt says thomas <unk> a miami-based investment manager who specializes in closed-end funds 
 share prices performed even worse than the funds ' asset values because fear has taken hold in the junk market he says 
 leverage is never a problem for the traditional open end mutual funds which are n't publicly traded and are n't allowed to use leverage at all 
 leverage is used only by some of the closed-end funds 
 the usual maneuver is to borrow against the portfolio value or issue preferred stock using the proceeds to buy additional bonds 
 the fallout for investors lately has been painful 
 consider the new america high income fund 
 with a leveraged position of about N N the fund 's share price has plunged N N so far this year 
 that 's worse than the price drop sustained by the bonds in its portfolio whose total return <unk> changes plus interest has amounted to a negative N N 
 such problems may not be over 
 leveraged funds in particular are still extremely vulnerable because we 're still at the beginning of problems in the junk market says george foot a managing partner at <unk> management associates in <unk> mass 
 many investors are <unk> their funds have borrowed to speculate in such a risky market 
 if someone actually sat down and thought about what they were being sold says gerald <unk> editor of the mutual fund letter in chicago they might shy away 
 in a typical leverage strategy a fund tries to capture the spread between what it costs to borrow and the higher return on the bonds it buys with the borrowed money 
 if the market <unk> holders can make that much more profit the leverage effectively acts as an <unk> margin account for investors 
 but when the market moves against the fund investors lose more than other junk holders because the market decline is magnified by the amount the fund is leveraged 
 fund managers for their part defend their use of leverage 
 carl <unk> who runs the colonial intermediate high income fund says the fund 's N N leverage has <unk> up its interest income 
 as long as i am borrowing at N N and each bond yields over that it <unk> the yield he maintains 
 mr. <unk> says he tries to offset the leverage by diversifying the fund 's portfolio 
 yet some funds have pulled in their <unk> 
 new america high income fund recently said that it plans to reduce its leverage position by buying back $ N million in preferred stock and notes from investors 
 the fund made a similar move earlier this year 
 we are trying to increase our flexibility says <unk> e. terry a vice president at <unk> capital management the fund 's investment adviser 
 she declined to elaborate and would n't disclose the fund 's recent purchases sales or cash position 
 ms. terry did say the fund 's recent performance illustrates what happens in a leveraged product when the market does n't cooperate 
 when the market turns around she says it will give a nice picture of how leverage can help performance 
 several leveraged funds do n't want to cut the amount they borrow because it would slash the income they pay shareholders fund officials said 
 but a few funds have taken other defensive steps 
 some have raised their cash positions to record levels 
 high cash positions help buffer a fund when the market falls 
 prospect street high income portfolio for instance now holds about N N in cash and equivalents nearly <unk> the amount it held earlier this year says john <unk> portfolio <unk> 
 he says the fund which is N N leveraged has maintained a substantial cushion between its borrowing costs and the yields of the portfolio 's bonds 
 i do n't want to be in a position to have to sell mr. <unk> says 
 other funds have recently sold weak junk bonds to raise cash 
 at the <unk> zenith income fund portfolio manager john <unk> recently dumped mesa petroleum <unk> and <unk> industries among others to raise his cash position to a record N N 
 that 's a problem because cash is n't earning us very much money mr. <unk> says 
 he concedes this is the most difficult market that i 've been involved in 
 because of the recent <unk> turmoil the fund is considering investing in other issues instead including mortgage-backed bonds 
 we 're looking at the leverage factor every day says robert moore president of <unk> inc. a shearson lehman hutton inc. unit and the fund 's adviser 
 at some point if we are unable to cover our leveraged cost and at the moment we 're right on it we 're going to have to make a move 
 one of the more bizarre garden stories since <unk> has been <unk> for four years now in the private <unk> <unk> of artist <unk> bartlett 
 and if she and the battery park city authority have their way her <unk> <unk> plan will soon go public as a real garden <unk> in the downtown complex 
 south gardens as the bartlett scheme is called will <unk> the last N acres of open space at the southwest tip of manhattan 
 it could cost taxpayers $ N million to install and <unk> residents $ N million a year to maintain 
 created by an artist who <unk> her ignorance of plants and gardens south gardens as now planned will die from <unk> garden design 
 ms. bartlett 's previous work which earned her an international reputation in the <unk> art world often took gardens as its nominal subject 
 <unk> this <unk> connection made the <unk> fine arts committee think she had a <unk> green <unk> 
 ms. bartlett would not discuss her garden for this article 
 last year she <unk> to <unk> magazine i 'd never looked at a garden in my life 
 and she proved no <unk> <unk> in her initial statement to the bpca a new york state public benefit corporation the only thing i was interested in doing was a very complicated garden which would cost an enormous amount of money and be very expensive to maintain 
 <unk> the bpca hired ms. bartlett and another confessed garden <unk> the architect alexander <unk> who claimed he had never visited much less built a garden and said of the project i do n't view this as a landscape 
 i view this as a building 
 the third principal in the south gardens <unk> did have garden experience 
 the firm of bruce <unk> <unk> landscape architects had created central park 's <unk> fields and shakespeare garden 
 the bpca called its team a stunning collaboration 
 after four years though the south gardens design is N N <unk> <unk> bartlett 
 she has done little more than <unk> her standard <unk> trees water landscape <unk> <unk> square houses circles <unk> <unk> and fit them into a grid as if she were making one of her <unk> <unk> works for a gallery wall 
 but for south gardens the grid was to be a <unk> network of <unk> or hedge walls with real plants inside them 
 in a letter to the bpca <unk> called this <unk> and <unk> 
 the landscape architects were expelled from the garden in july 
 all the while ms. bartlett had been busy at her <unk> <unk> in her sense of <unk> 
 as she put it in a N <unk> at the harvard graduate school of design i have designed a garden not knowing the difference between a <unk> and a <unk> 
 moreover she proclaimed that landscape architects have been going wrong for the last N years in the design of open space 
 and she further stunned her <unk> by <unk> her secret garden design method <unk> a friend to spend five or six thousand dollars on books that i ultimately cut up 
 after that the <unk> had been easy 
 i 've always relied heavily on the grid and found it never to fail 
 ms. bartlett told her audience that she absolutely did not believe in compromise or in giving in to the client because i do n't think you can do <unk> versions of things 
 this was never a problem with south gardens because the client had long since given in to ms. bartlett 's every <unk> 
 last year the public was <unk> a <unk> of ms. bartlett 's creation in a <unk> version at a <unk> exhibition 
 the labels were <unk> within its <unk> walls is a <unk> of a thousand years in garden design a rose garden <unk> garden <unk> garden <unk> fields an apple <unk> organized in a <unk> of <unk> <unk> to form rooms here and there are simple architectural forms a <unk> jet of water a <unk> of topiary or <unk> <unk> and chairs of every sort to drag around 
 at the core of it all is a love for plants 
 plant <unk> who studied the <unk> were alarmed 
 they looked at the <unk> and saw a giant <unk> 
 ms. bartlett 's little rooms left little room for plants or people 
 <unk> had put south gardens ' carrying capacity at four people per room or about N humans overall 
 this <unk> of tiny <unk> <unk> was inspired by the artist 's own digs my <unk> was N by N feet so N feet by N feet seemed like a good garden room 
 inside the grid were N of these plant cells <unk> full of clutter 
 one she made into a topiary <unk> room <unk> with plants <unk> into a <unk> tv piano and chairs 
 in another she <unk> topiary <unk> missile <unk> costing $ N each in heights up to N feet 
 another she <unk> with eight <unk> hedges for a topiary <unk> lesson in the <unk> of plants 
 in the <unk> <unk> she specified a <unk> <unk> garden <unk> 
 she ordered the <unk> done in a different <unk> <unk> and made the landscape architects study a book on <unk> 
 in one garden <unk> she <unk> a <unk> square glass <unk> meant to show off a <unk> <unk> floor <unk> a <unk> sink a huge <unk> with <unk> and a <unk> with <unk> 
 next door she put a smaller <unk> glass house where she suggested a flat of <unk> might be displayed in the dead of winter 
 in another <unk> called the <unk> <unk> N <unk> trees were to be crowded together at killing <unk> of N or N feet 
 <unk> need about N feet 
 one thing about the bartlett plan was never in doubt it would demand the full-time skills of a <unk> of topiary <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> 
 ms. bartlett <unk> suggested calling upon <unk> garden club workers for maintenance 
 furthermore she had insisted on <unk> so narrow five to eight feet and hedge corners so square that standard maintenance equipment trucks or cherry pickers could n't maneuver 
 then to make these <unk> quite literally rooms ms. bartlett had thrown up <unk> walls brick <unk> hedge eight to N feet tall casting her <unk> into <unk> <unk> <unk> 
 it was hard to see how <unk> would ever happen in south gardens without <unk> the walls in a <unk> array of <unk> 
 finally <unk> the bpca 's wishes to continue the popular <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for its <unk> views of new york harbor the <unk> of liberty and ellis island ms. bartlett threw up yet another wall this time concrete this time N N feet tall 
 she ran it the length of the south gardens <unk> <unk> out the city 's great natural water features the harbor and the river 
 within her garden she has <unk> a <unk> a <unk> <unk> and other costly <unk> waterworks <unk> the hudson 
 while the model was still on view manhattan community board N passed a resolution against south gardens 
 the parks council wrote the bpca that this too private exclusive complex and expensive <unk> garden belongs in almost any location but the <unk> 
 <unk> b. miller the noted public garden designer who restored central park 's <unk> garden recalls her reaction to the south gardens model in light of the public garden she was designing for <unk> street 's bryant park bryant park as designed in N failed as a public space because it made people feel trapped 
 by removing the hedges and some walls the bryant park restoration is opening it up 
 it seems to me the bpca plan has the potential of making south gardens a <unk> jail for people and plants 
 the three urban <unk> experts with cornell cooperative extension weighed in with a letter to the bpca that began we feel that the garden is <unk> doomed 
 they then addressed the <unk> questionable safety of a complex garden of endless <unk> places 
 the N <unk> hedges which <unk> views in and out of small rooms insure that this garden will be a potential breeding ground for crime 
 at harvard ms. bartlett had declared there are going to be problems with safety 
 i 'm not going to address questions of safety 
 despite the dire <unk> of knowledgeable garden professionals ms. bartlett 's south gardens design somehow continues on seemingly <unk> to reason stalled only by bureaucratic <unk> and <unk> <unk> 
 bpca president and ceo david <unk> hopes to negotiate a <unk> that could be significantly more <unk> <unk> 
 and by <unk> yet another landscape architect nicholas <unk> he insists he can achieve that and other <unk> to <unk> reality while still preserving the artistic vision of a truly great artist 
 after four years of no progress in this direction it is doubtful any viable collaboration with ms. bartlett will suddenly now be possible 
 mr. <unk> has said he plans to go with the grid regardless 
 there is still time however for gov. mario <unk> or <unk> <unk> chairman of the bpca board to prevent this topiary <unk> <unk> 
 these <unk> might take counsel from william robinson author of the english <unk> garden the <unk> 's <unk> since N who seems to have had a <unk> bartlett in mind when he wrote <unk> our <unk> for ages have suffered at the hands of the <unk> artist when applying his designs to the garden 
 it is this <unk> of absurd <unk> ' and patterns from old books to any surface where a <unk> garden has to be made that leads to bad and <unk> design wrong in plan and <unk> for the life of plants 
 i read the <unk> of wayne <unk> 's exchange with a <unk> representative put the soviet economy on golden <unk> editorial page oct. N with great interest since the gold standard is one of my areas of research 
 mr. <unk> is incorrect when he states that the soviet union 's large gold reserves would give it great power to establish credibility 
 during the latter part of the 19th century russia was on a gold standard and had gold reserves representing more than N N of its outstanding currency but no one outside russia used rubles 
 the bank of england on the other hand had gold reserves that averaged about N N of its outstanding currency and bank of england notes were accepted throughout the world 
 the most likely reason for this <unk> is that the bank of england was a private bank with substantial earning assets and the <unk> rights of creditors to collect claims against the bank were well established in britain 
 by contrast in <unk> russia an <unk> government owned the bank and had the power to revoke payment whenever it chose much as it would in today 's soviet union 
 the success of the british gold standard was due to independent private banking and common law rather than the choice of gold for <unk> the currency 
 it is no <unk> that from N to N when the bank of england was an independent private bank the pound was never <unk> and payment of gold for pound notes was never suspended but with the subsequent <unk> of the bank of england the pound was <unk> with increasing frequency and its use as an international medium of exchange declined 
 the soviet union should keep these <unk> in mind as it seeks to establish the ruble as an international currency 
 one way to make the ruble into a major international currency would be to leave reserves of gold and earning assets in a swiss bank with distributions based on swiss laws 
 unless the laws determining the <unk> 's rights to payment are independent of the issuer of those notes however a <unk> ruble would be as unsuccessful for the soviets as it was for the <unk>

 securities and exchange commission chairman richard breeden told a congressional subcommittee that he would consider imposing circuit breakers to halt program trading at volatile times 
 mr. breeden in his first testimony to congress since taking the sec post said the agency is studying the friday the 13th market plunge including how current circuit breakers affected the market that day and the following monday 
 after the study the sec would be willing to consider adding new circuit breakers or <unk> the current ones he added 
 circuit breakers designed to give the markets a <unk> in cases of sharp price movements curb trading of futures or stocks at various trigger points 
 at certain points during the friday the 13th drop circuit breakers kicked in on the futures market slowing trading at times 
 a circuit breaker that would have closed down the new york stock exchange was n't <unk> 
 rep. edward markey d. mass. chairman of the house telecommunications and finance subcommittee is pushing the idea of a circuit breaker for computer-driven program trading in hopes that would curb turmoil in the marketplace 
 he argued that program-trading by roughly N big institutions is pushing around the markets and scaring individual investors 
 mr. breeden did n't reject the proposal 
 after the sec study of the drop is completed he said i 'm perfectly happy to work with this committee in identifying whether we need other devices such as a program-trading curb 
 mr. breeden backed most of the provisions in a <unk> bill that the sec brought to the subcommittee last year under <unk> david <unk> 
 the measure is expected to move through this congress 
 but the new chairman <unk> opposed a provision in the bill that would give the agency the right to close the markets at times of stress 
 mr. breeden contended that uncertainty over when the sec might act could worsen volatility in the markets 
 he argued that the current <unk> system allows investors to know precisely when and where any trading <unk> will occur and how long they will last 
 mr. breeden offered strong support for two other provisions in the bill 
 one would force brokerage houses to provide the sec detailed information about loans made by their holding companies 
 such loans often are used to finance leveraged buy-outs and the agency is worried that a sharp market drop could create capital problems for the firms 
 he also backed a rule to require large traders to report transactions on a <unk> basis 
 that information he argued is critical to <unk> sharp market moves such as the one nearly two weeks ago 
 in a rare package sale of its real estate k mart corp. <unk> mich. has sold N of its strip shopping centers to a limited partnership led by new york developer philip <unk> according to sources familiar with the transaction 
 they estimate the value of the transaction at close to $ N million 
 k mart officials and mr. <unk> would n't comment on the sale 
 k mart previously had announced it would report its third consecutive decline in quarterly earnings for the period ended yesterday the same day the real estate deal was completed 
 analysts are estimating third-quarter earnings will drop between N N and N N to about N to N cents per share compared with N cents per share in the year-ago quarter 
 it is unclear what effect the sale of the shopping centers will have on earnings 
 k mart developed the centers which range in size from about N square feet to just over N square feet 
 most are <unk> by a k mart store 
 the retailer reportedly will lease its stores back from the developer who plans to expand the small centers 
 the centers <unk> a total of about N million square feet of retail space 
 they are spread around the country and include locations in california florida washington and arizona 
 mr. <unk> who heads <unk> international holding corp. a new york-based real estate company owns more than a dozen other shopping centers in which k mart is a <unk> 
 the company is active in office and residential development in new york 
 however nationally mr. <unk> controls through limited partnerships about N shopping centers with about N million square feet 
 k mart runs N k mart stores primarily in leased facilities 
 the company typically sells the centers it develops but has usually sold only one or several at a time 
 motorola is fighting back against junk mail 
 so much of the stuff poured into its austin texas offices that its mail rooms there simply stopped delivering it 
 now thousands of <unk> <unk> and sales pitches go straight into the trash 
 we just do n't have the staff to deliver it nor do we have the space or the time says a spokesman for the <unk> ill. electronics company which has N employees in the austin area 
 it 's the <unk> problem and the weight problem we have 
 motorola is in good company 
 businesses across the country are getting fed up with junk mail and some are saying they just are n't going to take it anymore literally 
 while no one has tracked how many company mail rooms throw out junk mail direct-mail advertising firms say the number is growing 
 general motors earlier this year said it would n't deliver bulk mail or free magazines in its <unk> mich. office while air products & chemicals <unk> pa. says it screens junk mail and often throws out most of a given mass mailing 
 why the <unk> 
 anybody with a <unk> can answer that sheer overwhelming <unk> volume 
 according to the direct marketing association total direct mail to both businesses and consumers jumped N N to N billion pieces in N from five years earlier 
 though direct mail to businesses is n't broken out separately the association says it 's growing even faster 
 the <unk> has spurred <unk> companies to action with mail rooms throwing the stuff out rather than taking the time or money to deliver it 
 the direct-mail industry not surprisingly is <unk> at the <unk> of it all 
 after all this is the industry that has a hard enough time getting any respect that is the <unk> of so many jokes that television 's l.a. law <unk> <unk> david as short <unk> intensely <unk> and <unk> boring 
 the practice of businesses throwing out junk mail is a commonly known problem and it 's increasing as companies attempt to put through budget cuts across the board right down to the <unk> level says stephen <unk> a list consultant and chairman of the direct marketing association 's <unk> council 
 but it 's like <unk> the hand that feeds them because every one of these companies uses direct marketing 
 it 's almost impossible to track the number of companies <unk> junk mail since the decision is usually made in the mail room not the board room 
 and the practice often <unk> from location to location even within a company 
 but industry executives say businesses seem especially inclined to dump <unk> sent to titles rather than to individual names 
 motorola 's austin operation was one of the first to lose patience deciding a few years ago to junk any bulk mail that was n't addressed to an individual 
 magazines are n't delivered at all even if an individual 's name is listed employees who want their magazines have to pick them up from the mail room or the company library and are told to change the <unk> to their home addresses 
 at air products meanwhile the <unk> staff opens junk mail and often throws it away even if addressed to an individual 
 if they get N <unk> of something they open one see what it says throw N away and send two to people or departments they think are appropriate a spokesman says 
 direct marketers were especially alarmed when general motors one of the country 's largest companies and a big direct-mail user itself entered the <unk> battle 
 as of march N its <unk> office with about N employees stopped delivering bulk mail and <unk> magazines 
 employees were told that if they really wanted the publications they would have to have them sent home instead 
 the reason <unk> especially of <unk> magazines 
 direct-mail executives see gm 's stand as an <unk> sign even if the <unk> <unk> did bring it on themselves 
 why anyone would want to close themselves off from direct mail a <unk> does n't make any sense says michael bronner of bronner <unk> associates a boston <unk> firm 
 it <unk> of big <unk> 
 they 're going to decide what their employees can or can not read 
 the practice is however legal in most cases 
 jack ellis a u.s. postal inspector in new york says the postal service 's only job is to deliver the mail to the mail room once it gets there a company can do with it what it wishes 
 the <unk> <unk> ever optimistic are looking for ways around the problem 
 so far they say it has n't had any <unk> effect on response rates 
 and before it does they 're trying to cut back on the clutter that created the situation in the first place 
 among other things the industry is trying to come up with standardized business lists that cut down on <unk> 
 we 're going to have to mail a lot less and a lot <unk> says jack miller president of <unk> corp. a <unk> ill. <unk> mail-order company 
 but then again mailing less and <unk> wo n't be much help if the mail ends up in the garbage anyway

 senate democrats who favor cutting the capital-gains tax are n't ready to line up behind the leading senate proposal 
 their reluctance to support the proposal is another blow to the capital-gains cut which has had a roller-coaster existence since the beginning of the year when it was considered dead and then suddenly revived and was passed by the house 
 nevertheless oregon sen. bob packwood the ranking gop member on the <unk> senate finance committee last night introduced his plan as an amendment to a pending measure <unk> u.s. aid for poland and hungary 
 senate majority leader george mitchell d. maine was confident he had enough votes to block the maneuver on procedural grounds perhaps as soon as today 
 mr. packwood all but conceded defeat telling mr. mitchell i sense at this stage you may have the votes 
 the two lawmakers <unk> in a highly personal fashion violating usual senate <unk> 
 their tone was <unk> with mr. packwood saying he intended to offer the proposal again and again on future legislation and sen. mitchell saying he intended to use procedural means to block it again and again 
 although the proposal <unk> by mr. packwood and sen. william roth r. del. appears to have general backing by republicans their votes are n't sufficient to pass it 
 and democrats who are under increasing pressure from their leaders to reject the <unk> cut are finding reasons to say no at least for now 
 a major reason is that they believe the <unk> plan would lose <unk> of revenue over the long run 
 the <unk> proposal would reduce the tax depending on how long an asset was held 
 it also would create a new individual retirement account that would shield from taxation the appreciation on investments made for a wide variety of purposes including retirement medical expenses <unk> purchases and tuition 
 a number of us are not going to touch capital gains iras or anything else unless it <unk> to deficit-reduction said sen. charles <unk> d. va. who is one of the N to N democrats who the bush administration believes might favor giving <unk> treatment to capital gains 
 president bush has been hearing this kind of opposition first hand during meetings over the past two days with democratic senators at the white house 
 and at a <unk> meeting tuesday of democratic senators there was outspoken opposition to cutting the capital-gains tax this year according to participants 
 the trend is making advocates of the tax cut less optimistic about success 
 there is a <unk> shot of getting it this year said sen. david boren of oklahoma a leading democratic <unk> of cutting the capital-gains tax 
 he called the battle <unk> 
 other democrats who favor a capital-gains cut are even more pessimistic 
 there will be no capital-gains bill this year said sen. dale <unk> d. ark 
 i 'm probably not going to vote for any capital-gains proposal 
 the ira portion of the <unk> plan is irresponsible 
 another significant factor in the <unk> debate is the extent to which it has become a <unk> political battle between president bush and senate majority leader mitchell 
 mr. mitchell has made clear to his <unk> colleagues that the issue is important to him personally 
 today sen. mitchell and other leading democrats plan to turn up the heat again by holding a news conference to <unk> the proposal 
 estimates requested by sen. mitchell from the congressional joint taxation committee show that the <unk> N taxpayers got an average benefit from the capital-gains <unk> of $ N million each in N the last year for which figures are available 
 white house officials acknowledged yesterday that democrats still are reluctant to publicly express support for the <unk> capital gains proposal because they are loath to buck sen. mitchell 
 as a result the officials said they are open to making a variety of deals with senate democrats to win their support for a capital-gains tax cut 
 democrats asked in this week for discussions with president bush have suggested ways of <unk> with the <unk> proposal suggesting an interest in looking for a modified version they can back one official said 
 in addition white house aides think that there are numerous other important measures democrats badly wanted passed such as the <unk> back of a controversial catastrophic health-care plan for the elderly that might provide the president leverage in cutting deals with democrats 
 a capital-gains tax cut might be <unk> with such measures to help ensure passage 
 other possibilities include a child-care initiative and an increase in the minimum wage 
 if they ca n't secure immediate passage of a capital-gains plan administration officials also are n't ruling out making a deal with congress to put off a vote until a firm date in the future even next year 
 but the officials insist that such a deal on a future vote would have to apply to both the house and the senate

 the institute 's <unk> efforts are based on the needs of the population it serves and represents 
 in N the medical tribune reported that a growing number of critics are challenging the fda <unk> equation 
 they contend it is based on an assumption that has not yet been proven in valid tests the tribune said

 in addition <unk> were beginning to report these <unk> as well

 president bush told reporters a few months ago that he was looking for the right test case to see whether he already has the line-item veto 
 vice president quayle and budget director darman said recently they 've joined the search 
 on tuesday the subject came up again when marlin fitzwater explained the constitutional argument based on the provisions above to the white house press corps 
 president bush does n't have any provision in mind but <unk> <unk> will be like <unk> at midnight in the coming continuing resolution 
 the harder question is whether anyone yet understands that mr. bush 's fight for his constitutional prerogatives is about politics as much as it is about law 
 we have been persuaded by the constitutional argument for the inherent line-item veto since N when lawyer stephen <unk> first made the case on this page 
 the N budget reform passed over president nixon 's veto took away the presidential <unk> power thereby introducing <unk> <unk> and <unk> the presidential veto 
 mr. <unk> discovered that the <unk> had worried that congress might take the president out of the <unk> 
 article i section N clause N says that whether it 's called an order resolution or vote or anything else presidents must have the chance to veto 
 <unk> an omnibus budget a bill ca n't <unk> the president of his power to veto items 
 finding a test case should n't be hard but there is something to be said for picking the best one possible 
 the white house had the perfect case but congress <unk> before it could go to court 
 after the hud and s&l stories broke some congressmen began to worry that their influence peddling at <unk> and independent agencies might some day get them in trouble 
 they worried about an interior department <unk> to <unk> all communications with members or their staffs 
 congress inserted the following into the interior <unk> none of the funds available under this title may be used to prepare reports on contacts between employees of the <unk> of the interior and members and committees of congress and their staff 
 the white house warned that this would be an unconstitutional <unk> of its power 
 when it threatened to use this provision as the test for a line-item veto congress <unk> 
 the fear congress has of any <unk> test led members to add the single most <unk> and ridiculous provision this year this section shall be effective only on oct. N N 
 this means interior contacts can not be <unk> only on one day a sunday that had already passed 
 if the white house is looking for another unconstitutional bill rep. john dingell is trying again to raise the fairness doctrine from the dead 
 president reagan vetoed this as a first amendment violation 
 the fairness doctrine 's enthusiasts are <unk> in the house who know the rules <unk> <unk> discussions on <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
 there are also other provisions requiring congressmen to join <unk> teams and new restrictions on <unk> 
 unconstitutional bills make good legal targets but the line-item veto is better understood as a political opportunity than as mere <unk> for lawyers 
 commenting on the budget mess this week president bush said the perception out there is that it 's the fault of congress 
 and you can look to the leadership and ask them why that is the perception of the american people 
 exactly right 
 now 's the time to make the political case that presidents need the line-item weapon to restore discipline to the budget 
 congress is in no position to <unk> mr. bush now that we 're into gramm-rudman 's <unk> 
 just this week the house-senate conference met N conferees divided into N different <unk> 
 senator daniel inouye agreed to close some bases in hawaii in exchange for such <unk> as $ N million for a parking lot at walter reed hospital 
 conference negotiator rep. bill <unk> pulled down $ N million in military bases for north carolina and <unk> allowed senator james <unk> $ N million for bases in tennessee 
 president bush should take the constitution in one hand and a budget <unk> in the other and get to work 
 he should <unk> out both unconstitutional provisions and budget pork 
 congress may have lost any sense of discipline but that does n't mean the country must learn to live forever with this mess 
 president bush has the power to change how washington works if only he will use it 
 troubled sci television inc. proposed to restructure much of its $ N billion in debt to buy time to sell assets and pay its obligations 
 the leveraged buy-out firm of kohlberg kravis roberts & co. which owns N N of the common equity of sci tv indicated in the debt plan that it would reduce its equity stake to N N giving the rest of its stake to bondholders in the restructuring 
 kkr also signaled to the company 's creditors that henry kravis and other kkr directors of sci tv would resign from the board once the restructuring is completed and <unk> their voting rights 
 holders of sci tv 's $ N million of high-yield junk bonds are being asked to <unk> a lot of debt in exchange for taking a N N equity stake in sci tv 
 they immediately termed the proposal inadequate and said the restructuring would not solve the company 's problems 
 i think the current plan is sufficiently flawed in a sufficient number of bondholders ' eyes that substantial revisions will be required to get it done says analyst craig davis of <unk> smith & co. here 
 investors interpreted the kkr move as a desire by the firm to wash its hands of sci tv 
 but a spokesman for kkr says that with only a N N equity stake it would n't be appropriate for kkr to keep board representation 
 kkr already has made about $ N billion of gains from earlier transactions with sci tv thus it is n't significantly affected by the company 's troubles 
 sci tv which is controlled by <unk> tenn. entrepreneur george gillett owns six tv stations including several cbs inc. affiliates 
 it is having trouble meeting its debt payments because of heavy borrowing in N for a leveraged buy-out 
 through investment banker drexel burnham lambert inc. sci tv is offering to exchange three classes of junk bonds for packages of new bonds and equity that investors value at ranges from N cents to N cents on the dollar 
 kkr would give up a N N equity stake to bondholders while mr. gillett would surrender an N N stake 
 while one big sci tv investor thinks that 's pretty generous many <unk> had been hoping that kkr and mr. gillett would invest new money in sci tv 
 those investors think sci tv needs new equity to survive 
 sci tv 's debt restructuring plan would defer payment of $ N million of bank debt 
 it also would defer interest and principal on junk bonds that have fallen due the grace period for paying the bill expires nov. N 
 at the same time investors estimate the restructuring would cut the company 's annual cash interest bill from about $ N million to $ N million 
 yet to pay that interest bill analysts say sci tv will only produce about $ N million to $ N million of cash flow a year

 the move is the biggest <unk> yet in the renewed outcry against program trading with kemper putting its money the millions of dollars in commissions it generates each year where its mouth is 
 the kemper corp. unit and other critics complain that program trading causes wild swings in stock prices such as on tuesday and on oct. N and N and has increased chances for market crashes 
 over the past nine months several firms including discount broker charles schwab & co. and sears roebuck & co. 's dean witter reynolds inc. unit have attacked program trading as a major market evil 
 several big securities firms backed off from program trading a few months after the N crash 
 but most of them led by morgan stanley & co. moved back in earlier this year 
 the most volatile form of program trading is index arbitrage the <unk> computer-guided buying and selling of stocks offset with opposite trades in stock-index futures and options 
 the object is to capture profits from fleeting price discrepancies between the futures and options and the stocks themselves 
 index arbitrage recently has accounted for about half of all program trading on the new york stock exchange 
 last month program trading accounted for N million shares a day or a record N N of the big board 's average daily volume 
 on tuesday afternoon kemper told bear stearns & co. general electric co. 's kidder peabody & co. unit morgan stanley and oppenheimer & co. that it will no longer do business with them because of their commitment to index arbitrage officials inside and outside these firms confirmed 
 kemper officials declined to identify the firms but acknowledged a <unk> dispute with four securities firms and said the list of brokers it wo n't do business with may be <unk> in the months ahead 
 we 've been opposed to index arbitrage for a long time said stephen b. <unk> chief investment officer at kemper which manages $ N billion including $ N billion of stocks 
 index arbitrage does n't work and it <unk> natural buyers of stock 
 while mr. <unk> explained he 's not totally convinced index arbitrage changes the overall level of the stock market he said that on an intraday basis it has major effects 
 we 've talked to proponents of index arbitrage and told them to cool it because they 're <unk> the market 
 they said too bad so we finally said we 're not going to do business with them

 at a time when jon levy should be planning the biggest spring season in his dress company 's N years his work day is <unk> with intense moments of concern about one of his biggest customers campeau corp 
 the dress business has always been a gamble but it 's never been like this says mr. levy president of st. <unk> group ltd. which has become a hot name thanks to a campaign of <unk> tv commercials 
 every day mr. levy checks orders from campeau department store chains trying to guess if he will be paid 
 i 'm now monitoring every major account 
 campeau owner of such retailers as bloomingdale 's <unk> <unk> and jordan marsh <unk> financial collapse last month after an emergency $ N million loan from olympia & york developments ltd. a canadian developer and a major shareholder in campeau 
 the need for the loan surprised many analysts and bond holders who had been told at the company 's annual meeting in july that there were n't any major problems ahead 
 the risk of doing business with campeau 's federated and allied department store chains is about to increase greatly not only for mr. levy but for hundreds of other small apparel makers <unk> suppliers trucking firms and fabric houses 
 next week the country 's top designers and manufacturers will begin showing <unk> for spring N the second most important selling season of the year 
 and as the applause dies down in <unk> along seventh avenue and broadway <unk> <unk> campeau buyers will begin writing orders 
 orders from campeau retailers used to be cause for celebration 
 this is no longer true because of campeau 's massive debt load 
 it 's all anybody wants to talk about says richard posner executive vice president for credit exchange inc. a leading credit service 
 people wonder what 's going to happen next 
 many manufacturers are worried about being paid for merchandise already shipped to campeau stores 
 but those dollars at risk pale in comparison to the investment required to make and ship spring goods to campeau stores 
 the few million dollars i could lose today is nothing against what i could lose on the spring line says mr. levy who estimates that campeau stores will sell $ N million worth of his clothes this year 
 i 'm buying fabric right now for clothes which i may not be paid for until april or may 
 what happens to me if campeau <unk> between now and then 
 some credit concerns such as bernard <unk> credit consultants inc. have told clients not to ship anything to federated or allied stores on credit 
 this is especially true for spring merchandise says jim <unk> credit manager at bernard <unk> 
 campeau has too much debt 
 other credit houses such as credit exchange and solo credit service corp. are suggesting that their clients study each order before shipping 
 payments are good right now but we are n't recommending any long-term lines of credit says richard hastings a retail credit analyst referring to credit lines which make inventory purchases automatic 
 the campeau situation is a little uncertain and very difficult to analyze 
 because of those concerns some manufacturers say they will ask for letters of credit before shipping spring merchandise 
 we 're being paid today but we 're worried about tomorrow and will want letters of credit says the sales director at one major dress maker who asked not to be identified 
 howard <unk> president of the dress firm <unk> b inc. says it 's big time chaos today 
 i 'm going to ship and hope i get paid 
 if i need to ask for money up front later i will 
 carol <unk> vice president corporate communications at campeau says that all of the federated and allied chains are paying their bills in a timely manner 
 they continue to pay their bills and will do so says ms. <unk> 
 we 're confident we 'll be paying our bills for spring merchandise as well 
 typically manufacturers are paid N days after the month in which they ship 
 if goods are shipped to bloomingdale 's between oct. N and oct. N manufacturers expect to be paid by nov. N 
 but manufacturers now buying fabric for spring season goods wo n't be paid until march april or even may 
 some in the market question whether campeau will be in a position to pay bills at that time 
 everybody is worried about the possibility of <unk> says kurt <unk> publisher of <unk> 's retail marketing report 
 the buyers who work for the various campeau chains may lose their jobs 
 the stores they work for may be sold 
 what that will mean for manufacturers is anybody 's guess 
 campeau 's financial situation is complicated by an estimated $ N billion in debt due next spring 
 this includes a working capital facility for allied stores of $ N million that <unk> march N N and an $ N million bridge loan due april N N 
 the company has stated in recently filed financial documents that it anticipates refinancing its march N payments 
 in recent months numerous retailers have filed for chapter N bankruptcy protection including <unk> teller b. altman & co. and miller & <unk> inc 
 those filings plus the expected sale of a number of financially healthy chains such as saks fifth avenue marshall field 's and bloomingdale 's have added to the anxiety 
 right now federated owes us a considerable amount of money says morris <unk> president of david warren enterprises a major dress manufacturer 
 we expect they will be current with their debts by the end of the week but we are considering asking them for letters of credit before we take more orders 
 mr. <unk> adds that his company is now holding some goods in anticipation of being paid in full 
 it 's become a <unk> business he says 
 business has never been this tough before 
 not only does your product have to be excellent but you also have to be able to collect 
 other manufacturers are equally cautious 
 <unk> <unk> president of <unk> miller inc. says his company is now shipping only to the flagship stores of the federated and allied chains 
 this limits his financial exposure he says 
 the branches are just <unk> over empty halls says mr. <unk> 
 why should i be part of that problem 
 i 've got limited production and i ca n't give it to <unk> 
 campeau 's ms. <unk> disputes mr. <unk> 's comments 
 many of the branches are very lucrative she says 
 that 's just nonsense 
 as for mr. levy at st. <unk> he says he will maintain his credit lines with the various campeau stores unless they miss a payment 
 if they slip for N cents for N minutes i 'll stop he says 
 bethlehem steel corp. <unk> by higher costs and lower shipments to key automotive and <unk> customers posted a N N drop in third-quarter profit 
 separately two more of the nation 's top steelmakers armco inc. and national intergroup inc. reported lower operating earnings in their steel businesses marking what is generally believed to be the end of a two-year boom in the industry 
 wall street analysts expect the disappointing trend to continue into the fourth quarter and through at least the first two quarters of N when the industry will increasingly see the effect of price erosion in major product lines such as rolled sheet used for cars appliances and construction 
 it does n't <unk> well for coming quarters said john jacobson who follows the steel industry for <unk> consultants 
 in fact he thinks several steelmakers will report actual losses through the third quarter of N 
 bethlehem the nation 's second largest steelmaker earned $ N million or N cents a share 
 the figures include $ N million in costs related to a blast <unk> <unk> and $ N million in losses from unauthorized work <unk> at the company 's coal operations 
 in the year-ago period bethlehem earned $ N million or $ N a share including a $ N million gain from early retirement of debt 
 third-quarter sales dropped N N to $ N billion from $ N billion a year ago 
 in composite trading on the new york stock exchange bethlehem shares rose N cents to $ N 
 of all the major steelmakers bethlehem would seem to be the most vulnerable to a slowdown 
 it has n't diversified beyond steel nor has it linked up with a joint venture partner to share costs and risks 
 however in spite of the difficult industrywide environment of high cost and low volume bethlehem had pretty good earnings numbers said <unk> <unk> <unk> an analyst with salomon brothers inc 
 ms. <unk> had estimated third-quarter earnings of N cents a share but said the losses for the unusual items were larger than expected 
 still bethlehem 's core basic steel operations experienced a steep drop in operating profit to $ N million from $ N million a year ago when the industry enjoyed strong demand and pricing 
 the company said its shipments declined as a result of a reduction in inventories by service centers a lackluster automotive market and increasing competitive pressures in the construction market 
 at the same time production costs compared with a year ago were boosted by higher raw material and employment costs which resulted from the company 's new labor pact effective june N 
 we anticipate that steel market conditions will exhibit a further moderate decline in the fourth quarter as the automotive sector remains weak and customers continue to adjust inventories said bethlehem chairman walter f. williams 
 he noted however that the company 's order entry has increased from the low levels of the early summer following the end of labor negotiations 
 armco hampered by lower volume in its specialty steel business said third-quarter net income dropped N N to $ N million or N cents a share from $ N million or N cents a share in the year-ago quarter 
 sales dropped to $ N million from $ N million because the company no longer <unk> its eastern steel division which is now a joint venture with <unk> steel corp 
 along with reduced volume analysts said the nation 's fifth largest steelmaker was hurt by holding <unk> inventory when raw material costs of such key products as nickel dropped 
 operating profit dropped N N in its specialty flat-rolled steel segment 
 moreover the company said higher sales and shipments to service centers from its armco steel co. joint venture failed to offset weakness in the automotive market higher production costs and a poorer product mix 
 armco shares closed unchanged at $ N in composite trading on the new york stock exchange 
 national intergroup which owns N N of the nation 's sixth largest steelmaker national steel corp. posted net income for the fiscal second-quarter of $ N million or N cents a share compared with a net loss of $ N million 
 sales increased in the quarter ended sept. N to $ N million from $ N million a year ago 
 the latest period includes gains of $ N million from early retirement of debt and tax loss carry-forward 
 last year 's results were hurt by $ N million in restructuring charges 
 national intergroup stock closed at $ N unchanged in composite trading on the new york stock exchange 
 the company noted that its <unk> drug co. ben franklin stores inc. and <unk> corp. operations showed improvements as a result of restructuring moves 
 however its equity in the net income of national steel declined to $ N million from $ N million as a result of softer demand and lost orders following prolonged labor talks and a threatened strike 
 national intergroup is negotiating for the sale of its N N interest in national steel to concentrate more fully on drug distribution operations 
 international business machines corp. said it agreed to let motorola inc. participate in a semiconductor research project as part of its effort to bolster the u.s. semiconductor industry 
 ibm which made the announcement at the <unk> of a research center here said it invited many other companies to participate as well including some from europe 
 jack <unk> ibm 's president said ibm is also considering letting other companies participate in additional semiconductor work but declined to be more specific 
 ibm which said a year ago it was inviting companies to participate in some semiconductor work has become far more open about its technology as it has tried to rally u.s. industry to head off the japanese who now dominate the market for dynamic random access memory chips 
 while ibm armonk n.y. makes the bulk of the <unk> it uses it does n't make the equipment needed to produce those chips 
 and ibm worries that the japanese will take over that equipment market too unless u.s. semiconductor companies produce enough memory chips here to keep u.s. equipment makers healthy 
 failure of u.s. equipment makers ibm fears would leave it dependent on many of the japanese companies that compete with it in other parts of the market 
 ibm also said it expects to benefit from the expertise that motorola and other companies can bring to bear on the difficult problems involved in semiconductor manufacturing 
 ibm already <unk> in one industrywide effort to improve <unk> techniques 
 ibm said it expects industrywide efforts to become <unk> because semiconductor manufacturing has become so expensive 
 a <unk> plant cost $ N million in the mid-1970s but costs $ N million today because the technology is so complex 
 and ibm said it expects the costs to continue climbing 
 ibm which said motorola is paying just a nominal fee to cover the <unk> agreement acknowledged some companies had turned down its invitation to join in 
 but it said that was mainly because the project may not bear fruit until the mid-1990s 
 ibm said it thought more companies would become interested as the project <unk> 
 the project involving motorola concerns a technique called <unk> <unk> that figures to be crucial to future generations of memory chips 
 currently chips are produced by <unk> light through a <unk> to produce an image on the chip much as a camera produces an image on film 
 but details on chips must now be extraordinarily fine and the <unk> of even <unk> light are long enough so that the images they draw may be too <unk> much as someone using a wide <unk> could produce a broad line but would have trouble painting a thin one 
 <unk> by contrast travel <unk> and can be focused more tightly than light 
 <unk> have problems too 
 they can make the <unk> <unk> and can pass through material they 're not supposed to 
 but assuming those problems can be overcome they should allow for memory chips that could approach one billion <unk> of information N times as much as is contained in the <unk> chips that are just reaching the market and a million times what was possible in the mid-1970s

 in a stunning shift in direction provigo inc. said it will sell all its non-food operations to concentrate solely on its retail and wholesale grocery business 
 the non-food operations accounted for about N N of provigo 's N billion canadian dollars us$ N billion in sales in the latest fiscal year 
 in a related move pierre lortie chairman and chief executive resigned 
 mr. lortie joined provigo in N and <unk> the company 's drive to grow outside its traditional food business 
 he could n't be reached for comment 
 <unk> nadeau newly appointed chairman and interim chief executive of provigo would n't say if mr. lortie was asked to leave 
 mr. lortie felt less <unk> mr. nadeau said given the decision to dump provigo 's non-food operations 
 at this stage it was felt i was perhaps more <unk> as chief executive 
 mr. nadeau also is chairman and chief executive of <unk> inc. provigo 's controlling shareholder 
 at a news conference mr. nadeau said the sale of the three non-food businesses which account for nearly half the company 's c$ N million in assets should be completed in a matter of months 
 the three units are a nationwide pharmaceutical and <unk> distributor a small <unk> chain and a combination catalog showroom and <unk> chain 
 investors and analysts <unk> the news 
 provigo was the most active industrial stock on the montreal exchange where it closed at c$ N us$ N up N canadian cents 
 i think it 's a pretty positive development said ross <unk> a financial analyst with <unk> <unk> <unk> inc. of the decision to concentrate on <unk> 
 mr. lortie 's departure while sudden was seen as inevitable in light of the shift in strategy 
 the non-food operations were largely mr. lortie 's creation and his strategy did n't work said steven holt a financial analyst with midland <unk> ltd 
 provigo 's profit record over the past two years <unk> the company 's and mr. lortie 's <unk> 
 for the six months ended aug. N provigo posted net income of c$ N million or eight canadian cents a share compared with c$ N million or N canadian cents a share a year earlier 
 sales were c$ N billion compared with c$ N billion 
 last month canadian bond rating service downgraded provigo 's commercial paper and debentures because of its lackluster performance 
 analysts are skeptical provigo will be able to sell the non-food businesses as a group for at least book value and are expecting write-downs 
 mr. nadeau said he could n't yet say if the sale prices would match book values 
 he said all three non-food operations are profitable 
 mr. nadeau said discussions are under way with potential purchasers of each of the units 
 he declined to confirm or deny reports that provigo executive <unk> roy is trying to put together a management buy-out of the <unk> showroom unit 
 mr. roy could n't be reached 
 <unk> <unk> was named senior executive vice president and chief operating officer of provigo a new position 
 mr. <unk> was president and chief operating officer of provigo 's quebec retail and wholesale grocery unit 
 mr. nadeau said he intends to remain provigo 's chief executive only until the non-food businesses are sold after a which a new chief executive will be named 
 comments by federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan lent some support to the dollar but the u.s. unit ended yesterday lower against most major currencies 
 foreign-exchange dealers noted that the impact of the chairman 's remarks was slight and warned that the currency remains sensitive to developments on wall street 
 traders said that mr. greenspan whose statements are ordinarily cautious was especially careful to avoid any <unk> <unk> with fears about equities still <unk> financial markets 
 <unk> before a panel of the house banking committee mr. greenspan said the short-term value of the dollar on foreign-exchange markets is n't the primary policy focus of the central bank 
 our essential focus is on domestic policy mr. greenspan said referring to the goals of price stability and a stable economy 
 in perhaps his most telling remark mr. greenspan termed the current u.s. inflation rate of around N N as much too high to be ignored 
 he added however that inflation could be brought down close to zero without throwing the economy into a recession 
 analysts viewed the chairman 's comments as an indication that the central bank is <unk> to ease monetary policy further in the near future 
 the dollar climbed immediately higher on news of mr. greenspan 's testimony settling lower in later trade as dealers <unk> positions ahead of today 's preliminary report on third-quarter u.s. gross national product 
 in late new york trading yesterday the dollar was quoted at N marks down from N marks tuesday and at N yen up from N yen late tuesday 
 sterling was quoted at $ N up from $ N late tuesday 
 in tokyo thursday the u.s. currency opened for trading at N yen up from wednesday 's tokyo close of N yen 
 many traders forecast a <unk> of the market 's recent bearish trend and predict the u.s. currency will remain stuck in its relatively narrow ranges in the near term and then shift lower 
 but according to doug madison a corporate trader with bank of america in los angeles a large number of short positions must first be corrected spurring a temporary <unk> before the unit can turn lower 
 he predicts a downward move in <unk> trade and a less dramatic slip in <unk> noting that there continues to be a large pool of japanese investor interest in u.s. securities which could provide a solid base for the dollar at around N yen 
 market participants hope today 's gnp report will offer more substantial evidence on u.s. economic growth although analysts are quick to point out that the figures may <unk> the economy 's <unk> 
 the r word is looming again says one dealer referring to persistent concern among some market analysts that the u.s. economy is heading toward a major slowdown if not a recession 
 some dealers note that while the third-quarter figures may appear relatively bullish the market consensus calls for a N N annual growth rate unchanged from the second-quarter rate it would take a significantly stronger figure to alter market perceptions that the economy is softening 
 some analysts <unk> that the next quarter 's figures will present a more accurate picture of the u.s. economy showing a marked slowdown in a number of sectors including housing starts and equities

 wall street would like ual corp. 's board to change its mind about keeping the company independent 
 but what happens next in the continuing takeover drama may depend more on the company 's two most powerful and <unk> unions the pilots and machinists 
 some people familiar with the situation believe that the collapse of the previous $ N billion buy-out if anything may have strengthened the hands of these two labor groups 
 as a result both may now have <unk> veto power over any ual transaction 
 one reason banks likely to react to any new ual deal with even more caution than the first time around probably will insist on labor harmony before they agree to put up cash for any new bid or even a <unk> recapitalization plan 
 united pilots have shown on a number of occasions they are willing and able to strike said an executive at fuji bank one of ual 's large lenders 
 if you have both labor groups on strike you 've got no revenue and that 's a very scary thing for a bank to be looking at 
 just this past week a leading japanese bank asked for a meeting with the machinists ' union leaders to determine where the union would stand if another bid or recapitalization became possible 
 another reason <unk> by their success in helping to scuttle the previous transaction the machinists are likely to be more aggressive if a second buy-out attempt occurs 
 the two unions already had significant leverage simply because their employer has yet to settle with either on new contracts 
 that gives them both the threat of a strike and the ability to resist any wage concessions that may be necessary to make a transaction work 
 thus even investors who are pushing for the board to do a recapitalization that would pay shareholders a special dividend and possibly grant employees an ownership stake acknowledge that the unions are key 
 there 's less likelihood of creating and completing a transaction without the unions ' cooperation and wage concessions said richard nye of baker nye investments a new york takeover <unk> 
 mr. nye thinks the ual board should be ousted if it does n't move soon to increase shareholder value 
 both the pilots and machinists have made it clear that they intend to block any transaction they do n't like 
 the pilots will be involved in any transaction that takes place around here pilot union chairman frederick c. <unk> declared yesterday 
 but whether the pilots can team up with their longtime <unk> the machinists is another question 
 the pilots ' mr. <unk> says his union would like majority ownership for employees 
 at the very least the pilots want some form of control over the airline perhaps through <unk> voting rights 
 on the other hand the machinists have always opposed majority ownership in principle saying they do n't think employees should be owners 
 still in recent days machinists ' union leaders have shown some new flexibility 
 we may be able to reach a <unk> where we can accommodate the pilot union 's concerns and <unk> said brian m. freeman the machinists ' financial adviser 
 mr. freeman said machinists ' union advisers plan to meet this week to try to draw up a blueprint for some form of recapitalization that could include a special dividend for shareholders an employee stake and perhaps an equity investment by a friendly investor 
 if a compromise ca n't be reached the pilots maintain they can do a transaction without the support of the machinists 
 but at this point that may just be <unk> thinking 
 the machinists lobbied heavily against the original bid from ual pilots and management for the company 
 their opposition helped scare off some japanese banks 
 the pilots ' insistence on majority ownership also may make the idea of a recapitalization difficult to achieve 
 who wants to be a public shareholder investing in a company controlled by the pilots ' union asks <unk> <unk> an analyst at wertheim <unk> & co 
 who would the board be working for the public shareholders or the pilots she adds 
 ms. <unk> says she believes a recapitalization involving employee ownership would succeed only if the pilots <unk> on their demand for control 
 she also notes that even if the pilots accept a minority stake now they still could come back at a later time and try to take control 
 another possibility is for the pilots ' to team up with an outside investor who might try to force the <unk> of the board through the solicitation of <unk> 
 in that way the pilots may be able to force the board to approve a recapitalization that gives employees a majority stake or to consider the labor-management group 's latest proposal 
 the group did n't make a formal offer but instead told ual 's advisers before the <unk> board meeting that it was working on a bid valued at between $ N and $ N a share 
 but again they may need the help of the machinists 
 i think the dynamics of this situation are that something 's got to happen said one official familiar with the situation 
 the board and ual 's management he says ca n't go back to business as usual

 columbia savings & loan association reeling from <unk> changes mandated by congress and the recent collapse of the junk-bond market announced a loss for the third quarter of $ N million or $ N a share 
 for the quarter a year ago columbia reported earnings of $ N million or N cents a share 
 total assets increased to $ N billion in the latest quarter from $ N billion a year earlier 
 the loss stems from $ N million of write-downs on columbia 's $ N billion high-yield investment securities portfolio which includes about $ N billion of junk bonds $ N million of preferred stock and treasury securities 
 columbia owes its spectacular growth in recent years to its junk-bond portfolio the largest of any u.s. thrift 
 much of columbia 's junk-bond trading has been done through the high-yield department of its beverly hills neighbor drexel burnham lambert inc 
 for the nine months losses totaled $ N million or $ N a share compared with net income of $ N million or $ N a share a year earlier 
 the results include a $ N million write-down of the securities in the high-yield portfolio to the lower of their cost or market value 
 columbia also added $ N million to reserves for losses on the portfolio increasing general reserves to $ N million or about N N of the total portfolio as of sept. N 
 on june N loss reserves stood at $ N million 
 thrift officials said the $ N million reserve will be adjusted quarterly and will reflect the rate of <unk> and market conditions 
 the adjustments result from the recently passed <unk> bailout legislation which requires thrifts to <unk> all high-yield bond investments by N 
 previously columbia did n't have to adjust the book value of its junk-bond holdings to reflect declines in market prices because it held the bonds as long-term investments 
 because columbia now must sell the bonds within five years accounting rules require the thrift to value the bonds at the lower of cost or market prices 
 for its future strategy columbia officials said the thrift may branch out into commercial lending or managing outside investments as well as <unk> up more traditional thrift activities 
 the quarterly results also reflected $ N million in <unk> losses from commercial real-estate activities in california 
 thomas spiegel columbia 's chairman said in a statement that the thrift was disappointed by the effects of the accounting changes 
 but he said columbia remains one of the most strongly capitalized thrifts in the industry based on the economic value of its assets and tangible capital 
 columbia announced the results after the close of the stock market 
 its shares closed at $ N each in composite new york stock exchange trading down N cents 
 the price of columbia shares has been cut nearly in half since august when they traded at about $ N as investors apparently realized that the thrift would be forced to take a big write-down 
 the stock 's decline accelerated in the past two weeks from a price of $ N a share on oct. N 
 columbia officials said they do n't know how quickly they will <unk> of the thrift 's junk bonds because federal regulations such as those that would allow thrifts to continue holding the bonds in separately capitalized subsidiaries have n't yet been completed 
 columbia officials also said the thrift should n't face problems meeting regulatory capital requirements despite the large reserves and write-downs and <unk> regulatory requirements that should be in place by year 's end 
 its ratio of tangible equity to total assets as of sept. N was N N and total equity was $ N million 
 the thrift emphasized that it has a large portfolio of equity securities issued in connection with corporate restructurings and leveraged buy-outs which has a book value of $ N million 
 although many of the transactions related to those securities have n't been completed columbia said the ultimate gain on the sale of those assets will range from $ N million to $ N million 
 columbia also has <unk> gains in its public equity securities portfolio of more than $ N million

 <unk> cos. said it plans to aggressively discount its major beer brands setting the stage for a potentially <unk> price war as the maturing industry 's growth continues to slow 
 anheuser the world 's largest brewer and u.s. market leader has historically been reluctant to engage in <unk> as a means of boosting sales volume 
 with the passing of the <unk> days of swelling industry sales however the <unk> and brief <unk> into discounting are becoming standard competitive weapons in the beer industry 
 over the summer anheuser competitors offered more and deeper discounts than industry observers have seen for a long time 
 some experts now predict anheuser 's entry into the fray means near-term earnings trouble for all the industry players 
 the st. louis company said major rivals philip morris co. 's miller brewing unit and <unk> coors co. have been following a policy of <unk> and deep discounting for at least the past N months on their premium brands pricing their product as much as N cents a <unk> below anheuser 's <unk> label in many markets 
 anheuser said it 's discounting policy basically would involve matching such moves by rivals on a <unk> basis 
 <unk> announced its plan at the same time it reported third-quarter net income rose a <unk> N N to $ N million or N cents a share from $ N million or N cents 
 <unk> sales were $ N billion up from last year 's $ N billion 
 anheuser said its new strategy started in some markets last month and expected to be applied soon in selected markets nationwide will mean <unk> earnings for the last half of N and for N 
 the projection sent anheuser shares plunging $ N in new york stock exchange composite trading yesterday 
 the stock closed at $ N on heavy volume of about N million shares 
 shares of coors the company 's sole publicly traded major competitor fell $ N apiece to $ N in national over-the-counter trading apparently on investor concerns over potential fallout from the coming pricing struggle 
 anheuser noted that beer industry sales volume is N is following the trend that has characterized the last half of the '80s with sales volume being essentially flat while consolidation creates fewer bigger players 
 we can not permit a further slowing in our volume trend anheuser said adding it will take appropriate competitive pricing actions to support our long-term market share growth strategy for the premium brands 
 anheuser said it continues to hold to its <unk> goal of a N N u.s. market share by the mid-1990s 
 beneath the <unk> <unk> <unk> lies a powerful threat from the brewing giant which last year accounted for about N N of all u.s. beer sales and is expected to see that grow to N N in the current year 
 anheuser is the biggest guy in the bar and he just decided to join in the <unk> <unk> said joseph j. doyle an analyst with smith barney harris upham & co 
 it 's going to get bloody 
 jerry <unk> publisher of beer marketers <unk> a trade newsletter said anheuser 's announcement means everybody else in the industry is going to have a difficult time reaching their profit objectives 
 prudential-bache securities inc. analyst george e. thompson <unk> the importance of the announcement and called any comparison between the coming <unk> <unk> and the seemingly <unk> <unk> wars unwarranted 
 mr. thompson calls discounting a loser 's game for anyone without a dominant market share and projected that anheuser 's statement of intent could simply be a means of warning competitors to ease up on <unk> or face a costly and <unk> battle 
 mr. thompson noted that the disappointing earnings which fell five cents a share short of his own projections contributed to the sell-off by an <unk> and currently <unk> investing public 
 but smith barney 's mr. doyle who yesterday trimmed his N anheuser earnings projection to $ N a share from $ N called the market 's reaction justified 
 while the third-quarter earnings were a moderate disappointment he said the real bad news is the intensity of price competition in the <unk> sector 
 according to mr. <unk> the newsletter publisher anheuser 's market share is nearly twice that of its <unk> competitor miller brewing which had a N N stake last year 
 it 's followed by <unk> brewery co. which has agreed to sell its assets to coors 
 both coors and <unk> have recently been <unk> market share to miller and anheuser

 the <unk> house by a margin of N votes failed to override president bush 's veto of legislation renewing federal support of medicaid abortions for poor women who are victims of rape and incest 
 the N roll call illustrates the limits of power a <unk> abortion-rights movement still faces 
 it continues to gain strength in the chamber but remains far short of the two-thirds majority required to prevail over mr. bush 
 democrats voted to override by a N margin but republicans were equally firm in support of the president who has threatened to make abortion a decisive issue on at least three separate fiscal N spending bills 
 yesterday 's vote dealt with the largest of these bills an estimated $ N billion measure funding the departments of labor education and health and human services 
 to gain more leverage abortion-rights advocates may seek to <unk> the bill into an omnibus continuing resolution next month 
 but the stark numbers yesterday when N votes were needed indicate the president is in a commanding position for at least this year 
 unless he changes they lose said a democratic leadership aide 
 the action came as congress sent to the president last night a <unk> spending bill to keep the government operating through nov. N and provide $ N billion in emergency funds to assist in the recovery from hurricane hugo and the california earthquake 
 by a <unk> N margin the senate approved the measure after <unk> further provisions sought by the influential california delegation and despite reservations the house adopted the bill on a N roll call 
 the package is more than $ N billion above the recommendations of budget director richard darman this week 
 but given the political importance of california the administration was content to use its influence to prevent any senate amendments adding further new appropriations 
 the $ N billion measure comes on top of $ N billion appropriated after hugo struck the carolinas and caribbean last month and these totals do n't reflect the additional benefit of <unk> disaster loans 
 the bill last night includes $ N million to help finance this credit and further raises the obligation ceiling for the small business administration <unk> to $ N billion to accommodate the expected loan activity 
 in direct cash assistance $ N billion is provided in federal highway construction funds and $ N billion is divided between general emergency aid and a reserve to be available to the president to meet unanticipated costs from the two disasters 
 in the senate majority whip alan cranston used his position to win not only the expanded credit but also more generous treatment than the house had permitted in the distribution of highway funds in the next six months 
 the emergency assistance would n't be counted against a state 's normal allocation of annual highway funds and the bill <unk> existing restrictions that otherwise would prevent the use of federal aid to repair a toll road such as the san <unk> bay bridge damaged in last week 's earthquake 
 the underlying <unk> bill is the second required by congress this fall and since the current fiscal year began oct. N only the energy and interior departments are operating on permanent appropriations enacted into law 
 the <unk> over abortion is certain to contribute to further delays and apart from the health and education measure vetoed by mr. bush bills funding the district of columbia and the entire u.s. <unk> budget are in jeopardy because of related abortion or <unk> issues 
 the vote yesterday was the most <unk> in many years and though the democratic leadership is <unk> about how to address the abortion issue the debate is increasingly measured in party terms 
 the N democrats who supported the override yesterday compare with N who initially backed the <unk> exemption two weeks ago and N last year on a similar vote 
 by comparison republicans have held closer to the anti-abortion movement 
 only N gop members opposed the president 's veto a marginal increase over the vote two weeks ago and just N more than the N who supported the <unk> exemption last year 
 at a recent white house meeting rep. <unk> <unk> r. mass. the ranking minority member of the house appropriations committee argued with his friend mr. bush against a veto and though mr. <unk> and minority leader robert <unk> of illinois stood with the president yesterday they are <unk> uncomfortable with his position 
 this is n't a political issue this is a moral issue said rep. henry <unk> r. ill. the most <unk> spokesman for the anti-abortion movement 
 but after years of using the issue for its benefit the gop finds its candidates on the defensive 
 new jersey gubernatorial candidate rep. james florio <unk> returned from <unk> to vote against the president yesterday in contrast with his opponent gop rep. james courter who has <unk> supported abortion restrictions in the past but was <unk> 
 in an extraordinary mix of <unk> and <unk> powers rep. robert <unk> r. calif <unk> his fellow roman <unk> including mr. florio for having the <unk> to disagree with the <unk> of their church on abortion 
 rep. <unk> <unk> was as blunt on behalf of the abortion-rights movement

 the new york stock exchange is expected to launch its own program trading vehicle today just as controversy over this trading strategy <unk> up 
 the big board this morning plans to begin trading its exchange stock portfolio basket product the first program-trading vehicle carrying the exchange 's seal of approval 
 <unk> will allow institutional investors to buy or sell all N stocks in standard & poor 's index in a single trade of a minimum of $ N million 
 <unk> baskets of fewer stocks will also be available 
 the securities and exchange commission gave provisional six-month approval to the big board basket at a meeting late yesterday 
 the sec at the same time approved a similar but smaller basket product on the chicago board options exchange where the minimum will be $ N million 
 also approved was a plan to trade stock portfolios by computer after regular hours on the midwest stock exchange 
 the basket products are an <unk> step in solving problems in trading big blocks of stock that came to light in the N market crash said sec commissioner joseph <unk> 
 new sec chairman richard breeden overseeing his first public meeting said there have been concerns that the big board 's basket could attract investors with a short-term perspective who would rapidly turn over the product thus increasing volatility 
 but richard <unk> the sec 's market regulation chief said he did n't believe this will <unk> dramatic new program-trading strategies that will be <unk> 
 the baskets on the big board and cboe which involve the actual s&p stocks unlike the stock-index contracts currently traded on the chicago futures markets and index options on the cboe will begin trading as critics step up their attacks on program trading and its contributions to the stock market 's wild price swings 
 the big board argues that its new product will help rather than hurt the situation by possibly drawing business from <unk> forms of program trading 
 <unk> are also an attempt by the big board to head off the exodus of program trading business to overseas markets such as london 
 big board officials also hope japanese investors will become interested in the exchange 's product 
 already many of the big board 's own floor traders are warning that the <unk> baskets are risky and not in the best interests of the investing public 
 the <unk> alliance of floor brokers said the new product with the $ N million minimum will benefit only big institutional investors and could lead to wild <unk> of volatility 
 stockbrokers who cater to individual investors said the big board 's new product confirms the exchange does n't want to curtail program trading which last month accounted for a record N N of the exchange 's average daily volume 
 the new york stock exchange is losing its cool here said james <unk> head of institutional trading at <unk> montgomery scott inc. in philadelphia 
 the new stock baskets are going to make it easier for program trading to be done 
 and it 's going to be done more frequently as the result of having more access to it at different places 
 both the big board 's exchange stock portfolio and the chicago exchange 's market basket are designed for institutional investors 
 the big board lists its targets as pension plans mutual fund managers and index-arbitrage traders 
 in index arbitrage program traders buy and sell stocks and stock-index futures to profit from small price discrepancies between the markets 
 at the same time only four securities firms have signed up with the big board to buy and sell <unk> as market makers an <unk> response 
 the market makers so far are cs first boston group 's first boston corp. unit morgan stanley & co. painewebber group inc. and salomon inc. 's salomon brothers inc. unit 
 kidder peabody & co. a general electric co. unit that has become the biggest program trader along with morgan stanley is n't a market maker although the big board hopes that will change 
 similarly the big board hopes to <unk> merrill lynch & co 
 neither has plans to be a market maker for now 
 traders said major securities firms are reluctant to become market makers because they fear the baskets may attract only limited trading 
 big board officials say only N contracts a day may trade at first equivalent to a day 's action at a small regional exchange 
 even though the big board says its product represents a post-crash reform some traders suggest that if the new basket had been trading during this month 's friday the 13th market plunge the dow jones industrial average might have dropped more than the N points it did 
 with the futures locked into a trading halt oct. N and trading in some individual stock difficult program traders would have undoubtedly fled to the basket system the traders say 
 if we had the baskets we would be leaving in <unk> one trader said 
 the sec 's mr. breeden said the <unk> trading on the midwest exchange would help the u.s. win back business that has moved overseas to conduct <unk> trades

 in composite trading yesterday on the new york stock exchange comprehensive care shares plunged $ N to close at $ N on volume of N shares 
 the loss in comprehensive care 's latest quarter is equal to N cents a share 
 in the year-earlier quarter comprehensive care earned $ N million or N cents a share 
 revenue in the latest quarter fell N N to $ N million from $ N million the company said reflecting poor utilization of the company 's facilities and its <unk> medicine contracts 
 comprehensive care shareholders have approved acquisition of the developer and operator of <unk> chemical <unk> and psychiatric programs for about $ N million in cash notes and stock of first hospital norfolk va 
 the price was reduced last august from an indicated value of $ N million 
 comprehensive care said first hospital had advised it that both bank debt and senior notes would be repaid after the acquisition although it is n't assured the acquisition will be completed 
 if it is n't completed comprehensive care said it would be required to promptly restructure its debt 
 first hospital advised comprehensive care that an agent for the financial institutions providing financing of its acquisition is scheduled to make a final credit determination tomorrow and that a favorable determination could result in a reorganization at comprehensive care by the end of october 
 failure to win such a determination however would lead comprehensive care directors to consider various alternatives comprehensive care said without <unk> 
 separately first hospital reported a N N rise in net income to $ N million for its year ended june N on a N N increase in revenue to $ N million 
 it said however that net income for the <unk> period ended aug. N plunged to $ N from $ N in the prior year on a N N rise in revenue to $ N million

 after coming close to a partial settlement a year ago shareholders who filed civil suits against ivan f. boesky and the partnerships he once controlled again are approaching an accord people familiar with the case said 
 meanwhile within the next few weeks the limited partners in ivan f. boesky & co l.p. are expected to reach a partial settlement with drexel burnham lambert inc. regarding the distribution of the $ N million in partnership assets said one of the individuals 
 under the terms of the settlement the limited partners would drop their civil suits against drexel now pending in federal court in new york another individual said 
 attorneys involved in the talks said that the parties were closer to accord than they were a year ago when reports of an imminent agreement circulated 
 one individual said the shareholders ' accord was well worked out 
 however less optimistic attorneys warned that because of the <unk> of numerous defendants and plaintiffs with <unk> claims there is always the possibility that the talks will again fall apart 
 a shareholders ' accord would provide the first <unk> to thousands of individuals and institutions claiming losses as a result of insider trading by boesky & co. once the largest arbitrage fund in the u.s. 
 the plaintiffs are investors who bought and sold securities in which mr. boesky and his partnerships were dealing 
 some claim they suffered losses because they sold while he was buying and others because they bought while he was selling 
 stocks involved in the shareholder suits include union carbide rjr nabisco american natural resources <unk> cascade corp. general foods corp. houston natural gas and <unk> corp 
 there are at least N class-action shareholder suits that have been consolidated in federal court in new york under u.s. district judge milton <unk> 
 among the defendants are mr. boesky the <unk> ivan f. boesky & co. mr. boesky 's main underwriter drexel burnham and <unk> & general securities plc a british investment fund once controlled by mr. boesky 
 individuals familiar with the negotiations said the partial settlement being negotiated would remove the boesky partnership the british fund and mr. boesky as defendants while drexel and other defendants would remain 
 charles <unk> of the washington <unk> law firm <unk> cutler & <unk> which represents mr. boesky in this matter said only that discussions are under way 
 there are no agreements yet 
 it has been three years since mr. boesky now in prison agreed to pay a $ N million fine to settle the government 's charges that he had traded illegally using insider information 
 out of this the government set up a $ N million fund for plaintiffs who can prove their financial losses 
 according to william <unk> an attorney at <unk> & <unk> the escrow agents for the fund as of sept. N the fund amounted to $ N million 
 separately attorneys for the N or so limited partners have had serious discussions that could lead to the distribution of the partnership 's assets 
 the limited partners include insurance companies financial institutions and individual investors 
 an agreement with drexel regarding the limited partners ' investments is an essential step toward getting their money back 
 this is because a delaware court earlier this year said that drexel is entitled to get its money back before or at the same time as the limited partners 
 drexel is owed $ N million by the partnership 
 an individual familiar with the negotiations said that whatever investments the limited partners do not recoup from the $ N million in partnership assets they will receive from the $ N million <unk> fund available as a result of drexel 's settlement with the government in december N 
 drexel agreed to plead guilty to six felony counts and pay $ N million of which $ N million was set aside for shareholders and other plaintiffs including the limited partners who claim they were injured by drexel

 he turned himself in to authorities in new york earlier this year 
 he maintains that the information from the fbi will help him get his N conviction vacated and his <unk> indictment dismissed 
 his attorneys claim he was <unk> by the fbi and new york police as part of a campaign to destroy the black liberation movement of the 1960s 
 because the federal freedom of information act was n't law at that time the fbi was n't required to turn over information on its investigations when mr. ferguson appealed his conviction in the 1960s 
 but in federal court in manhattan judge patterson said the fbi records could show that mr. ferguson 's arrest was the result of questionable legal practices 
 the judge said that if the fbi 's proposed schedule was followed in <unk> the documents a delay of over one year will have occurred and plaintiff will have served approximately two-thirds of his N 1\/2-year minimum sentence by the time he receives the files

 federal courts urged to cut costs and reduce delays of civil suits 
 the study conducted by a task force of the <unk> institution suggests that congress should require the courts to develop the plans 
 the study was initiated by senate judiciary committee chairman joseph <unk> d. del 
 the washington d.c. think tank recommends that the courts adopt different tracks for different types of civil cases in order to separate the handling of highly complex suits from simpler ones 
 complex cases such as antitrust suits and many business disputes would receive intense supervision by federal judges to keep pretrial proceedings moving 
 standard cases would require less judicial attention and <unk> cases could be resolved quickly 
 the study also said each federal court should set strict time limits for the pretrial exchange of documents and evidence ranging from as much as N days for cases in the fast track to as much as N months for complex disputes 
 and the study said federal courts should set firm trial dates early in the process 
 to take advantage of local expertise and custom the study said congress should require each of the N federal district courts to adopt its own plan to speed the handling of civil suits and to reduce the high costs in civil cases 
 although some of the study 's recommendations resemble those of similar projects the makeup of the task force was unusually diverse adding significance to the effort 
 it included lawyers from civil rights and consumer groups plaintiffs ' lawyers and defense attorneys corporate counsel and law professors

 an <unk> jones survey of integrated oil companies independent refiners and oil industry consultants indicates that the organization of petroleum exporting countries increased its production to N million barrels a day in september 
 estimates suggest october 's figure may be even higher 
 that level of production is n't of much concern as long as demand continues strong analysts said 
 but the first quarter of the year is generally the weakest and opec production does n't seem to be <unk> in anticipation of that 
 also maintaining current demand assumes no significant slowdown in world economies

 grains and soybeans 
 soybean and corn futures prices moved higher on the strength of buying from commodity pool managers trying to profit from technical price trends as well as continued export strength 
 a <unk> off of farmer selling tied to the harvest also removed some of the downward pressure on futures contract prices 
 wheat futures prices fell however at least partly in reaction to the rumored selling of futures contracts equal to several million <unk> of wheat by commodity <unk> richard dennis 
 neither mr. dennis nor officials of his chicago trading company <unk> commodities could be reached for comment

 cotton 
 futures prices rose modestly but trading volume was n't very heavy 
 the december contract settled at N cents a pound up N cent but it rose as high as N cents 
 several cotton analysts said that the move appeared to be mostly technical 
 traders who had sold contracts earlier in hopes of buying them back at lower prices yesterday were buying contracts back at higher prices to limit their losses 
 floor traders also said that the market could have been helped by rumors which have been circulating for the past two days about china purchasing cotton 
 the rumor which has been neither confirmed nor denied has china buying N to N <unk> for near-term delivery 
 one floor trader said that if there were chinese purchases they should have had a bigger effect on the market 
 another said that if china was a buyer it would be the earliest that country had made purchases since the N crop year and thus would be a bullish sign 
 this trader characterized the recent price action as a contest between the <unk> who see higher prices ahead and the technicians who are basically buying cotton toward the bottom of the current trading range around N cents and selling it when the price <unk> more than N cents 
 this trader said that he thought the market would turn aggressively bullish from a technical standpoint if the december contract was able to exceed N cents 
 he also noted that stocks on aug. N N are currently projected at N million <unk> the smallest <unk> supply since N 
 cocoa 
 the modest sell-off which started on tuesday continued 
 the december contract ended at $ N a metric ton down $ N 
 the market is <unk> at least partly because of a lack of crop information out of <unk> and the ivory coast the two largest african producers 
 harry schwartz a soft commodity specialist for <unk> investors services in new york said the only report <unk> has issued about the <unk> of cocoa from the interior was for N metric tons as of oct. N 
 by this time last year he noted <unk> totaling N tons had been announced 
 a similar situation apparently exists in the ivory coast with no figures released yet this year compared with N tons as of this time a year ago 
 he said that if little cocoa actually has arrived at the ports shipping delays could result 
 this is the worry that probably brought <unk> to the market earlier in the week he said 
 there was also some fear that without ivory coast cocoa a large french cocoa merchant cie financiere <unk> <unk> <unk> might not be able to deliver cocoa against the contracts it had sold earlier for december delivery in london 
 however the french merchant has about N tons of old crop ivory coast cocoa <unk> in the netherlands from an agreement it had negotiated with the ivory coast last spring 
 <unk> thinks that even though the merchant has a contract <unk> that it wo n't bring this cocoa to market until after march N there is some evidence the contract has been modified 
 this <unk> apparently would permit the french merchant to deliver this cocoa if necessary against existing short positions

 japan is going on a <unk> binge that could make its trade surpluses even harder to shrink 
 its capital spending is growing at double-digit rates for the second year in a row and its <unk> producers of everything from cars to computer chips are rushing to expand capacity modernize factories and develop new products 
 the boom 's so huge says <unk> <unk> an economist at <unk> research institute it makes you think of the golden <unk> when japan developed rapidly 
 the more factories and robots japanese manufacturers add the more they will be able to export and the less their domestic customers will need to import 
 at <unk> inc. for example sales are up nearly N N this year so the maker of cameras and computer printers is doing what any japanese company would do under the circumstances it is increasing capital spending by N N 
 it is building among other things a new <unk> factory in western japan that can produce up to N printers next year 
 some N N of them are to be exported to the u.s. 
 even companies in <unk> industries <unk> with world-wide overcapacity are joining the boom 
 japan 's steelmakers are raising capital spending N N this year to $ N billion 
 hitachi <unk> corp. a <unk> buried in debt just a few years ago will build a machinery plant its first expansion in N years 
 so big is the <unk> boom that japanese companies ' outlays in japan topped american companies ' domestic outlays by $ N billion to $ N billion in the N months ended march N even though japan 's total output of goods and services is less than two-thirds america 's 
 from a financial standpoint the boom could n't come at a better time 
 many japanese companies expect record profits this fiscal year and japanese interest rates though up a bit recently are still low 
 and in a business system where shareholders have few rights and expect only modest dividends companies can <unk> their profits back into plant and equipment 
 but some economists and government officials here are n't <unk> 
 they fear that the boom may be too big for japan 's or anyone else 's good 
 it 's an explosive <unk> thrown at the world says kenneth <unk> senior economist at the tokyo unit of deutsche bank group 
 the ministry of international trade and industry is so concerned that it recently took the unusual step of urging japanese auto companies to exercise caution in capital spending 
 <unk> officials hope to avoid <unk> source of trade <unk> with the u.s. even though export restraints currently limit japanese car exports to the u.s. 
 not everyone is worried however 
 some economists and many japanese companies are <unk> by the warnings 
 the investment boom is mainly sparked they say by strong domestic demand and is n't likely to increase exports sharply 
 moreover much investment is n't aimed at increasing capacity 
 according to a survey of some N large companies by the japan development bank expanded capacity is the goal of just N N of the outlays for manufacturers alone the figure is N N 
 the manufacturers said N N of their spending is designed to improve products or add new ones N N is to cut costs N N is for research and development and the rest is for maintenance and other purposes 
 but the <unk> remain <unk> 
 with japan running enormous trade surpluses against much of the world they think that japan should meet the increased domestic demand by importing more 
 and eventually they contend domestic demand will weaken forcing companies to <unk> exports again 
 if there 's a further drive to export says <unk> <unk> an economist at the japan development bank that 'll be a problem 
 even in the short run the investment boom could <unk> a disturbing trend japanese exports are showing surprisingly little tendency to ease 
 japanese auto makers for example are increasing their production capacity in the u.s. the additional production should in part replace imported vehicles with locally manufactured ones 
 but although japanese companies increased their u.s. auto output by N N from january to september compared with the year-earlier period their exports to the u.s. will drop only N N this year nikko research center estimates 
 in contrast to previous economic <unk> japanese auto companies are n't just trying to boost production 
 many are pouring money into developing high-quality products to target affluent consumers and to some extent to avoid direct combat with cheaper cars from south korea and taiwan 
 others are replacing older facilities with flexible assembly lines on which different models can be turned out at once 
 so many companies are investing in high-tech machinery that <unk> ltd. a robot maker also had to build a new plant 
 the buildup is making japan clearly more efficient more <unk> advanced and more competitive declares a western diplomat in tokyo 
 but whatever its effects on exports and imports japan 's investment boom during the past two years has been <unk> at least partly by soaring domestic demand 
 japan 's marathon economy growing at N N this year is now in its <unk> month of expansion and some economists are betting that the boom will <unk> the record <unk> expansion in the late 1960s 
 japanese consumers are increasingly eager to spend their money especially on high-priced goods such as <unk> television sets and luxury cars 
 nissan motor co. 's domestic auto sales are up N N this year largely because its expensive <unk> <unk> and <unk> models are in heavy demand 
 one dealer told me that if he had more cars he 'd sell them right away says <unk> <unk> nissan executive vice president 
 he adds that the company is trying to keep up with demand by <unk> its employees 
 similarly honda motor co. 's sales are so brisk that workers <unk> they have n't had a saturday off in years despite the government 's encouragement of more leisure activity 
 with demand growing and workers in short supply many japanese manufacturers are spending heavily on <unk> 
 among them are the <unk> which had <unk> their shipyard work forces to cut costs during a prolonged slump in demand but now are <unk> an increased share of the strengthening global market 
 <unk> heavy industries co. a medium-sized <unk> expects its sales to increase N N this year largely because of rising demand for oil <unk> 
 once one japanese company steps up its investments the whole industry follows 
 because most businesses put market share above profitability to let a competitor 's addition to capacity go <unk> is to concede defeat 
 the emphasis on market share is evident at daikin industries ltd. japan 's biggest maker of industrial air <unk> 
 seeing new office buildings <unk> up and its sales soar daikin is building another plant which will lift its production capacity N N 
 the expansion is aimed not just at meeting demand but also at expanding the company 's market share to N N from N N currently 
 besides daikin 's major competitors hitachi ltd. and mitsubishi heavy industries ltd. are all adding production lines a daikin spokesman says 
 until now we were trying to increase productivity with the facilities we already had 
 but we ca n't produce enough anymore 
 the competition is even more <unk> in the auto industry where companies are racing one another in a world-wide market 
 nissan aims to expand its N N share of the market to N N by spending $ N million on a plant in southern japan that could make as many as N cars a year

 those who are n't worried about how japanese manufacturers ' investments will affect trade note that many new products are n't <unk> for imports 
 although imports account for less than N N of beer sales in japan <unk> <unk> ltd. which has been gaining share with its popular dry beer plans to fend off japanese competitors by pouring $ N billion into facilities to <unk> N N more beer 
 but <unk> development will make japanese companies stronger and big investments in domestic industries such as beer will make it even tougher for foreign competitors to crack the japanese market 
 moreover much of the investment boom is in high-tech fields in which japanese companies have only limited foreign competition so more investment practically <unk> more exports 
 toshiba corp. for example is spending $ N million on two new plants to build <unk> dynamic random access memories the next generation of computer chips 
 the product is n't widely used yet but toshiba which has already beaten everyone else in producing the <unk> <unk> <unk> believes that its early investment will <unk> its chances of beating its competitors again

 federal health officials are expected today to approve a program granting <unk> access to the drug azt for children with acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
 announcement of the approval is expected to be made by louis sullivan secretary of health and human services 
 the clearance by the food and drug administration comes after two years of restricted access for the youngest victims of aids to the only <unk> drug yet cleared to treat the fatal disease 
 the drug will be given treatment <unk> new drug status a label <unk> to drugs believed effective but lacking formal approval 
 the move will make the drug available free of charge for a time to children with the disease and symptoms of advanced infection 
 adults with aids have had access to azt since fda approved the drug 's usage for adults in march N 
 but despite more than two years of research showing azt can relieve <unk> and other symptoms in children the drug still lacks federal approval for use in the youngest patients 
 as a result many youngsters have been unable to obtain the drug and for the few exceptions insurance carriers wo n't cover its cost of $ N a year 
 so far aids has <unk> N children under age N with many times that number believed to carry the infection without symptoms 
 to date N of those children have died according to the federal centers for disease control

 i could get azt says mrs. <unk> who bears her infection without any symptoms 
 but my daughter could n't until she was too ill to take it 
 to watch your child die is an <unk> experience 
 her son healthy and <unk> currently takes no medication 
 the delay in getting azt to children has been blamed on a combination of factors 
 traditionally the medical establishment has waited two years to approve adult <unk> for pediatric uses because of a combination of conservative safety standards and red tape 
 <unk> critics have charged azt 's maker <unk> wellcome co. with corporate <unk> because children account for just N N of the patient population and hence a small part of the large and lucrative market 
 wellcome has replied that it is moving ahead to <unk> the relevant data and recently promised to develop a pediatric <unk> form easier for youngsters to take 
 still all this comes nearly a year and a half after philip <unk> of the national cancer institute offered evidence that azt could reverse the <unk> of aids <unk> sometimes prompting dramatic recovery of <unk> levels and <unk> of lost motor skills 
 since then roughly N pediatric patients have received the drug in his program

 the bad news in the junk bond market yesterday was that tw services a group of restaurant chains became the latest prospective issuer to get a cold shoulder from bond buyers 
 the good news to fans of stable credit at least is what the rejection says about the state of mind of junk buyers 
 apparently they are learning to say no to excess risk 
 coniston partners which with related entities controls N N of tw had been planning to sell $ N billion of junk bonds among other things to finance their acquisition of the remaining public shares 
 but coniston a new york partnership managed by the firm of <unk> <unk> & oliver yesterday announced that in view of unsettled conditions in securities markets the offering would be postponed and restructured 
 what was n't mentioned is that coniston and its investment banker donaldson lufkin & jenrette just completed a <unk> road show for the purpose of marketing the bonds 
 and investors at least for now took a pass 
 tw 's junk bonds were n't as junk bonds go unusually weak 
 its fast-food restaurants including <unk> 's <unk> 's <unk> 's and el <unk> <unk> the only significant fast-food chain to specialize in <unk> chicken are stable <unk> and growing 
 but unless they continued to grow tw based in <unk> n.j. would have run into trouble 
 until recently such <unk> <unk> deals were routine 
 but people do n't buy anything on expectation anymore says jack <unk> who manages the high-yield fund of <unk> financial services 
 investors he adds are getting <unk> 
 the tw buy-out may yet be financed 
 there is nothing wrong with the company says coniston principal paul <unk> 
 the <unk> he says is that the junk market is n't as deep as before 
 tw 's <unk> meeting was postponed from tomorrow to nov. N 
 by then dlj hopes to be able to sell <unk> junk bonds 
 <unk> <unk> & oliver is likely to contribute more than the $ N million in equity it had planned on 
 banks may contribute more senior debt 
 and the total amount of junk financing will be reduced 
 a dlj banker putting a best possible face on it asserts that very few people said they did n't like the credit quality 
 people said they did n't think a billion-dollar deal would trade 
 but trading risk stems from credit risk 
 and by adding equity dlj would seem to be acknowledging that credit risk was a concern 
 indeed the dlj banker says in the <unk> capital structure cash coverage of interest will <unk> improve 
 as he sums it up we are listening to the market 
 what is it to borrow a term from coniston that so unsettled the market 
 some of the same risks that were cited and seemingly ignored in dozens of previous junk offerings 
 the tw prospectus says that if the acquisition had been completed earlier pretax earnings would have been insufficient to cover its fixed charges including interest on debt securities by approximately $ N million in the first six months of N 
 tw notes as many junk issuers do that adjusted to eliminate <unk> charges tw would have run a cash surplus in this case of $ N million over six months 
 but such calculations ignore the <unk> charge of depreciation taken to allow for the gradual wearing out of french <unk> deterioration of stores and the like 
 in fact dlj says the company <unk> capital expenses of about $ N million a year 
 tw 's pitch was that sales and earnings at its restaurants have risen steadily and that people wo n't stop eating during a downturn 
 but they wo n't necessarily eat at <unk> 's 
 the fast-food business is intensely competitive notes wertheim schroder analyst john <unk> 
 prospective bond buyers noted that tw historically has <unk> because it has been willing to spend aggressively on remodeling restaurants and <unk> <unk> 
 we were concerned that they were n't going to generate enough cash for capital spending and also to pay down debt says a big investor in high-yield debt 
 dlj argues that tw could if necessary cut capital spending since half of what it plans to spend is for growth rather than maintenance 
 but investors noted that under the <unk> offering tw would have needed to grow to meet its debt payments 
 its calculations for meeting cash charges ignore $ N million a year in interest on <unk> or zero-coupon debentures which ultimately would have had to be paid 
 the prospectus notes there can be no assurance that future growth will continue at past levels 
 in the recent past bond buyers did n't seek such assurance 
 now apparently they do

 one day last march cbs sports president neal pilson and olympics <unk> barry frank met for lunch at the <unk> club here 
 mr. frank told mr. pilson that olympics officials wanted $ N million or more for tv rights to the N winter games in norway 
 the cbs official said that price sounded fine 
 at that price cbs was the only player at the table when negotiations with the international olympic committee started in toronto aug. N 
 dick pound a committee member began by disclosing that abc and nbc had refused to even bid 
 then he asked mr. pilson to raise his offer anyway if we can have a number that starts with a three you can have a <unk> 
 mr. pilson and his team <unk> in a <unk> and took just N minutes to return with a $ N million offer 
 mr. pound responded it 's a deal 
 a <unk> mr. pilson announced his <unk> coup at a news conference that afternoon 
 mr. pilson 's rivals at abc and nbc <unk> at the price 
 how could cbs get pushed into <unk> itself 
 well cbs mired in the ratings <unk> and looking to sports as a way out wanted to close the deal immediately and block its rivals from getting another chance to bid 
 but mr. pilson has been put in the uncomfortable role of setting off a bidding frenzy for sports rights a frenzy that the networks had hoped to avoid 
 the price of <unk> has gone up <unk> charles m. <unk> the college football association 's executive director 
 with cbs inc. on a spending spree that may top $ N billion for four years of major sports events the new <unk> of <unk> could jolt the entire broadcast business 
 cbs itself could run up losses of a few hundred million dollars on four years of various sports if its big gamble goes wrong 
 abc a unit of capital cities\/abc inc. and general electric co. 's national broadcasting co. also risk losses if they <unk> cbs for other contracts 
 while rights fees head <unk> ad rates wo n't 
 advertisers already are <unk> at higher prices 
 the networks are paying too much for rights warns <unk> paul <unk> of young & rubicam 
 if they ask advertisers to absorb the costs they 're likely to lose all but a few who need sports above all 
 viewers may not be <unk> either 
 soaring rights fees will lead to an even greater clutter of commercials 
 at the same time some sports events will move off free television and onto cable or <unk> where half the nation 's tv homes ca n't see them 
 cbs has changed the rules by throwing out the old basis for sports bids that is can the network alone make a profit on it 
 mr. pilson <unk> the <unk> benefits of positive press <unk> affiliate stations enthusiastic advertisers and huge audiences that might stick around to watch other cbs programs when the game is over 
 the billion-dollar question is how much are those benefits worth 
 some tv people doubt they will <unk> and argue that even if they do they wo n't offset the multimillion-dollar deficits that cbs could run up 
 as we 've seen in the '80s says roger werner the president of the espn sports channel those deals can turn sour if the numbers do n't work 
 and three years later in a sea of red ink the heroes can find themselves with a lot of explaining to do 
 cbs <unk> top sports to <unk> the fact that they are n't supporting affiliates viewers and advertisers charges thomas h. <unk> who was ousted as chairman of cbs inc. after laurence a. tisch bought a N N stake in the company and took over three years ago 
 they lost the entertainment crown and they needed one 
 and they 've bought one 
 on just three big deals for four years of baseball and for the olympic winter games in both N and N pilson bid a total of $ N billion 
 that 's well over half a billion dollars more than abc and nbc were willing to pay 
 after N the winter and summer olympics will be held two years apart with the revised schedule beginning with the winter games in N and the summer games in N 
 now mr. pilson a former college basketball player who says a good negotiator needs a level of focus and intellectual attention similar to a good <unk> is facing the consequences of his own <unk> 
 next month talks will begin on two <unk> cbs contracts for the pro and college basketball <unk> 
 cbs is likely to spend whatever it takes to keep them 
 the potential bill more than $ N million for several seasons an N N jump 
 a few months later cbs 's college and pro football contracts come up for renewal they could go for close to $ N million more than cbs now pays a N N to N N rise 
 what happens to those two basketball contracts will shape the next five years of network sports says peter <unk> a former cbs sports president now at <unk> inc 
 j. william <unk> former president of espn says nbc may come in with a huge bid for college basketball to take it away from cbs and say we can <unk> too 
 and the winners will be the colleges not either network 
 nor by the way advertisers 
 mr. pilson is an unlikely big <unk> 
 in the mid-1980s after abc had just bid a record $ N million for the N winter games he <unk> at rivals for paying reckless prices 
 i love pilson but he was the guy who complained most bitterly and <unk> says robert <unk> a former cbs sports president 
 and yet his company is one reason why rights are so high today 
 rivals <unk> at the principle of pilson as nbc 's arthur watson once put it he 's always <unk> that rights are too high then he 's going crazy 
 but the <unk> mr. pilson is hardly a man to ignore the numbers 
 a yale law school graduate he began his career in corporate law and then put in years at metromedia inc. and the william morris talent agency 
 in N he joined cbs sports to head business affairs and five years later became its president 
 mr. pilson says that when he spoke out a few years ago i did n't say forever and i did n't say every property 
 the market changed he adds 
 and he is n't the only big <unk> nbc will pay a record $ N million for the N summer games and espn <unk> by capital cities\/abc will shell out $ N million for four years of baseball airing N regular-season games a year 
 our competitors say we <unk> them 
 who <unk> 
 maybe we recognize values the other guys do n't mr. pilson says 
 mr. pilson 's major events strategy <unk> after mr. tisch took over 
 mr. pilson recalls that in april N after cbs 's annual meeting in philadelphia he and mr. tisch took the <unk> train ride back to new york and mr. pilson used this extended private audience to <unk> his ambitions 
 mr. tisch a billionaire in hotels and finance was just learning the tv business 
 five months later mr. tisch took over as cbs 's chief executive and soon he was <unk> sole approval each time mr. pilson <unk> a <unk> large figure on a slip of paper <unk> it in an <unk> and gave it to sports negotiators 
 then in may N mr. tisch <unk> needed to make a bold statement to <unk> rumors that he might sell the network 
 mr. pilson gave him one he bid $ N million for rights to the N winter games in <unk> france abc and nbc would n't bid even $ N million 
 that started the <unk> bidding wars 
 the major events strategy mr. pilson says is designed to <unk> a place for cbs on the crowded tv dial of the 1990s 
 it 's also a fast fix for an ailing image 
 he sees flashy sports as the only way the <unk> network can cut through the clutter of cable and <unk> grab millions of new viewers and tell them about other shows <unk> a few weeks later 
 next october cbs for the first time wo n't have to start the season against the <unk> american and national baseball league <unk> and the world series 
 i 've been struggling against that for years says jonathan <unk> who runs <unk> the <unk> station in chicago 
 even if baseball <unk> losses at cbs and he does n't think it will i 'd rather see the games on our air than on nbc and abc he says 
 that is n't surprising 
 regular tv series ratings have slumped in the past five years and <unk> new shows is a <unk> shoot mr. pilson says 
 but top sports events are still a strong bet to lure audiences N N or N N larger than those cbs usually gets 
 mr. pilson says baseball and the olympics may help cbs move up to no. N in the household ratings race putting <unk> back into the network 's image 
 and the winter olympics will air during the february <unk> when ratings are used to set ad rates for local stations 
 that will please <unk> affiliates another aim of the pilson plan 
 they <unk> await the dream season in N 
 cbs will air the <unk> bowl baseball playoffs college and pro basketball <unk> and other premier sports events 
 it 's made me more committed to cbs says philip a. jones the president of meredith corp. 's broadcast group which has two cbs affiliates 
 the cbs plan to use big-time sports as a platform for other series carries no guarantee of success however 
 no amount of <unk> will bring viewers back if the shows are weak 
 in this market of N channels sophisticated viewers and the <unk> control trial is n't a guarantee of anything espn 's mr. werner says 
 if the show ai n't a killer they 're gone 
 during the N summer games for example abc touted call to glory but the military drama was missing in action within weeks 
 last october during the N summer games nbc <unk> pitched a new series <unk> 
 it <unk> anyway 
 moreover sports is hardly the best way to lure adult women 
 though cbs might move up to no. N in household ratings most advertisers buy based on ratings for women aged N to N 
 cbs may remain a distant no. N in that regard 
 nor is cbs a <unk> to get blockbuster ratings 
 in recent years the world series and the olympics were aired against cbs 's <unk> lineup 
 but cbs will put the athletes up against bill cosby <unk> and other shows in nbc 's no. N schedule 
 even the <unk> to affiliate relations may be limited 
 the sports lineup may add only N N to N N to a station 's annual profits 
 it alone is n't likely to stop a station from <unk> cbs shows 
 the world series seven nights was n't enough of an incentive says arnold <unk> of <unk> in rochester which dropped cbs for nbc six weeks ago 
 you 've got to judge where the network will be in three years 
 the <unk> benefits may prove extremely costly if cbs ca n't avoid big losses on the sports coverage itself 
 and avoiding such losses will take a <unk> effort 
 on the $ N billion baseball agreement alone cbs is likely to lose $ N million in four years contends mr. <unk> the former cbs man now at comsat inc 
 nevertheless he <unk> the deal plain smart for its huge promotional value 
 mr. pilson calls that loss estimate wildly inaccurate <unk> only that cbs will lose money on baseball in the first year 
 it 's too early to tell what happens after that he says 
 but mr. tisch expects losses in all four years of the contract he told u.s. senators last june 
 cbs will pay an average of $ N million more each year than abc and nbc had paid together and those two networks expect losses on baseball this season 
 yet cbs will air only N regular-season games N fewer than abc and nbc 
 that has <unk> some fans 
 it also indicates a $ N million drop in ad sales for regular-season games a risk cbs took to get an unprecedented lock on all <unk> games 
 if the playoffs end in four-game <unk> losses could soar 
 advertisers are <unk> higher prices which would help close the gap 
 cbs signed general motors and toyota to be the only <unk> sponsors in baseball for four years 
 price $ N million 
 but ad executives who negotiated the deal say that works out to only $ N for a <unk> ad in the world series through N N N less than what abc is charging for the series this month 
 moreover there 's no question ad rates will come down considerably from the <unk> price says arnold chase of bozell inc 
 other <unk> however say rates could rise later if ad spending <unk> 
 the winter games outlook also is mixed 
 cbs expects to make modest profits but rivals contend that it will take a beating 
 abc lost $ N million on the N winter games partly because of its $ N million rights fee 
 it aired N hours of mostly live events in calgary helping raise ratings slightly from N but still failed to deliver the audience promised to advertisers 
 cbs will add N N hours to that load in N and ratings could be hurt by a lack of live events 
 all prime-time fare will be on <unk> because of time differences with norway so the results can be announced on the N <unk> news 
 turner broadcasting will pay cbs $ N million to air N hours of cbs coverage plus N hours of additional events 
 barry frank the agent who took mr. pilson to lunch last march says that even if cbs loses say $ N million it matters little 
 ten million ai n't jack man when you got $ N billion sitting in the bank says mr. frank senior vice president at international management group citing cbs 's enormous cash reserves from selling off various businesses 
 it does n't mean anything it 's public-relations money 
 moreover sports has claimed its place as a guaranteed <unk> says david j. stern the commissioner of the national basketball association 
 this is n't <unk> bidding this is a situation of very careful businessmen making judgments about the worth of product and acting on it 
 i would tend to trust their judgment 
 that 's easy for him to say cbs 's four-year <unk> pact now at $ N million for four years could double in price by the time his talks with mr. pilson are completed later this month 
 that would cut into cbs 's slim margin for profit and error 
 cbs sports earned $ N million or so last year 
 and cbs takes in the least money in prime time abc and nbc charge N N to N N more for ads according to a variety survey 
 but cbs 's costs are huge and the risks go up with each new sports package that cbs <unk> up 
 although sports officials predict <unk> of N N to N N in the major contracts coming up for renewal ad rates may rise only N N 
 cbs hopes to save money by ordering fewer episodes of regular series because sports will fill up a few weeks of prime time 
 but the savings will be <unk> 
 each hour of olympics and baseball in prime time will cost cbs $ N million to $ N million an <unk> drama costs only $ N and it is aired twice 
 cbs may cushion losses with about $ N million a year in interest earned on the proceeds from selling cbs records and other businesses 
 but <unk> analyst richard j. macdonald of macdonald <unk> <unk> says wall street wo n't take <unk> to that 
 on a <unk> basis the network ought to make money he says 
 when mr. pilson is asked directly can you make money on all this he does n't exactly say yes 
 what you 're really asking is are the profit and loss margins anticipated on the events acceptable to management he says 
 then he answers his own question 
 yes they are 
 that 's the only question we need to address 
 place a phone order through most any catalog and chances are the clerk who answers wo n't be the only one on the line 
 bosses have big <unk> these days 
 or open up an electronics magazine and <unk> the ads for <unk> tape recorders and other <unk> <unk> 
 some would make even james bond green with envy 
 <unk> both corporate and private is on the rise thanks to the proliferation of <unk> technologies 
 and while sellers of the equipment and companies monitoring employees have few <unk> <unk> advocates and some lawmakers are alarmed 
 new technologies are changing the way we deal with each other and the way we work says <unk> goldman a staff attorney at the american civil <unk> union 
 our expectation of <unk> is being eroded 
 on the corporate side companies claim that monitoring employee phone conversations is both legal and necessary to gauge productivity and ensure good service 
 the practice is common at catalog insurance and phone companies banks and <unk> according to trade groups and worker organizations 
 it 's also widespread for reservations <unk> in the airline <unk> hotel and railroad industries 
 the communications workers of america which opposes such monitoring says supervisors listen in on an estimated N million calls each year 
 among companies saying they monitor employees are united airlines american airlines united parcel service nynex corp. spiegel inc. and the circulation department of this newspaper 
 some wall street firms monitor for <unk> purposes 
 dictaphone corp. says there 's a big business demand for its <unk> taping systems whether the sophisticated <unk> N system which costs from $ N to $ N and can record N conversations simultaneously or simple <unk> units selling for $ N 
 businesses want to <unk> information and ensure <unk> says john <unk> dictaphone 's manager of media relations 
 the state of alaska recently bought the <unk> system he says to monitor the exxon cleanup effort 
 merrill lynch & co. and shearson lehman hutton inc. say they use <unk> systems to record and <unk> orders between salesmen and traders 
 shearson says it has taped some of its institutional trading desks such as commodities and futures for about four years 
 both companies stress that employees know they are being recorded and that customer conversations are n't taped 
 kidder peabody & co. says it monitors <unk> conversations between brokers and customers to <unk> order <unk> 
 <unk> by individuals is harder to measure 
 but devices are there for the asking whether in stores or through the mail 
 the counter spy shop in washington d.c. for instance offers the secret connection <unk> case which can <unk> record conversations for nine hours at a stretch 
 that and other fancy <unk> may cost thousands but simple <unk> tape recorders sell for as little as $ N at electronics stores like radio shack 
 the most common use of <unk> devices is in <unk> cases say private investigators 
 while tape <unk> to <unk> say <unk> are n't <unk> in court they can mean leverage in a settlement 
 concerned with the increased availability of <unk> technology and heavier use of it lawmakers have proposed laws addressing the issue 
 nine states have introduced bills requiring that workers and customers be made aware of monitoring 
 and four states california florida michigan and pennsylvania have adopted rules that all parties involved must consent when phone calls are recorded 
 two bills in congress hope to make such restrictions national 
 in may rep. don edwards d. calif introduced congressional legislation that would require an <unk> <unk> during any employee monitoring warning people that they are being heard 
 the legislation is similar to a N <unk> bill that was defeated after heavy lobbying by the <unk> industry 
 also last spring rep. ron <unk> d. calif. introduced a bill requiring universal <unk> consent to any <unk> in cases that do n't involve law enforcement 
 in addition products such as <unk> tape recorders would have to include <unk> <unk> and labels explaining federal laws on <unk> 
 the outlook on both federal bills is uncertain especially <unk> the N defeat 
 the <unk> and worker organizations back tighter laws but employers and device manufacturers object 
 i 'm sympathetic with workers who feel under the gun says richard <unk> of the direct marketing association of america which is lobbying <unk> against the edwards <unk> bill 
 but the only way you can find out how your people are doing is by listening 
 the powerful group which represents many of the nation 's <unk> was instrumental in <unk> the N bill 
 spiegel also opposes the <unk> bill saying the noise it requires would interfere with customer orders causing <unk> and even errors 
 <unk> dale center manager at the catalog company 's customer order center in <unk> nev. <unk> monitoring 
 we like to follow up and make sure operators are <unk> our standards of company service says ms. dale who <unk> N operators 
 john <unk> a nynex spokesman says the telephone company needs to monitor operators to evaluate performance during the first six months on the job 
 sometimes he says we 'll pull someone off the phones for more training 
 federal <unk> statutes recognize the right of employers to monitor employees ' for evaluation purposes 
 and in the past congress has viewed monitoring as an issue best handled in union negotiations 
 but opponents led by the <unk> say new laws are needed because monitoring is heavily concentrated in service industries and N N of monitored workers are n't represented by unions 
 the <unk> claims that monitoring not only <unk> on employee privacy but increases stress 
 nine to five a <unk> office workers organization that supports the <unk> bill six months ago started a privacy hot line to receive reports of alleged monitoring abuses 
 meanwhile supporters of the <unk> <unk> consent bill say it is needed because of a giant <unk> in the <unk> consent law 
 currently if the person taping is a party to the conversation it 's all right to record without the knowledge of the other person on the line 
 <unk> other people 's private conversations is illegal and punishable by five years in prison and fines of $ N 
 the electronics industry is closely following the <unk> bill 
 some marketers of <unk> gear including communication control system ltd. which owns the counter spy shop and others like it already put warning labels in their <unk> <unk> customers of the <unk> law 
 but vendors contend that they ca n't control how their products are used 
 radio shack says it has a policy against selling products if a <unk> suspects they will be used illegally 
 everything sold at radio shack has a legal purpose says bernard <unk> president of the tandy corp. subsidiary 
 he says he has n't yet studied the <unk> bill but that requiring a <unk> tone on recorders would be <unk> 
 still radio shack is aware that some of its products are controversial 
 a few years ago the company voluntarily stopped selling the big <unk> a powerful <unk> 
 with its ability to pick up <unk> and <unk> wings it was meant to be a toy for children for <unk> watching says mr. <unk> 
 but we were getting too many complaints that people were using them to <unk> on their neighbors 
 the hottest <unk> in the computer industry <unk> sharply yesterday as digital equipment corp. announced its first line of mainframe computers targeting international business machines corp. 's largest market 
 ibm fired back with new mainframes of its own extending the <unk> N line with a N N to N N power boost 
 up to now the intense competition between ibm and digital has been confined largely to the broad <unk> of the computer market where digital sought to exploit ibm 's weaknesses in <unk> 
 but digital 's move into mainframes will target ibm 's home turf where it has a commanding N N share of the market 
 digital maynard mass. insisted yesterday that its marketing focus would differ sharply from ibm 's 
 this is not your father 's mainframe said <unk> <unk> a digital spokesman 
 it 's a whole new generation he said 
 ibm which gets about half its revenue and more than half its profit from mainframes also announced upgraded operating system software that together with the new hardware lets customers do so-called batch processing as much as N N faster 
 batch processing is the <unk> <unk> data processing that most mainframes typically <unk> through at night such as <unk> accounts at banks 
 ibm said the N new <unk> and <unk> models will generally be available immediately though three wo n't ship until the third quarter of next year 
 prices on the larger models which range as high as $ N million generally wo n't change 
 small models whose performance increased as much as N N will carry higher prices 
 <unk> to bigger models also will be <unk> 
 digital 's vax N mainframes which it claimed were among the fastest available were priced from $ N million to $ N million sharply lower than ibm models of comparable power 
 the first models will ship in the spring with the largest following in the fall 
 analysts were disappointed that digital 's new line apparently wo n't contribute much to earnings before the next fiscal year which begins in july 
 jay stevens of dean witter reynolds inc. said he may cut his earnings estimate for the current fiscal year because he had expected at least some mainframe profit this year 
 but he added that he expected to raise his estimate for fiscal N at the same time 
 after the announcement yesterday digital shares gained $ N to close at $ N in new york stock exchange composite trading 
 ibm shares closed at $ N down N cents in big board trading 
 analysts have predicted strong <unk> demand for the new line among digital 's customers 
 large digital buyers say the new vax will let them stay with digital when they need the power of a mainframe instead of turning to ibm 
 i 'm convinced there 's a huge market for this machine said stephen smith of painewebber inc 
 digital also plans to compete fiercely with ibm when the giant 's customers are <unk> new aspects of their businesses 
 digital however does n't expect to <unk> ibm mainframes that are already installed at big companies 
 in addition to commercial markets digital 's new line targets the low end of the engineering and scientific supercomputer market when it 's packaged with an <unk> <unk> known as a <unk> <unk> 
 digital 's push into mainframes comes at a time when its mainstay <unk> line is under growing pressure from smaller personal computers and workstations that operate on standard operating systems rather than on the <unk> systems that older minicomputers use 
 although digital has <unk> out a major presence in the booming workstation market profit margins in that market are much <unk> than for mainframes 
 the <unk> mainframe market also has shown new signs of life lately 
 ibm 's mainframe sales have held up better than expected this year with analysts estimating they have risen N N to N N 
 demand for these systems has been very very strong said bill <unk> a senior ibm marketing executive 
 we have a good strong backlog for the fourth quarter even without the systems that were announced yesterday 
 but the N line is nearly five years old which is getting up there in mainframe years and its growth is expected to slow in N 
 ibm armonk n.y. said it wanted to bring out the mainframes as soon as it could to spark as many sales as possible by the end of the year 
 the fourth quarter is always ibm 's biggest by far with most sales coming in december as customers seek to use budgets before year end 
 still steve cohen an analyst at <unk> financial group inc. said i do n't see that this will be sufficient to give ibm a significant kick in the fourth quarter 
 ibm has already indicated it will have problems in the quarter partly because of a delay in shipping a high-end disk drive and partly because the strong dollar will cut significantly the value of ibm 's overseas earnings when translated into dollars 
 some analysts have estimated ibm 's fourth-quarter per-share earnings will fall N N to $ N a share from $ N a share a year earlier 
 in addition to the new mainframe hardware and software ibm announced a <unk> system for data storage that it said <unk> half as much floor space as older systems but can store five times as much data on a single <unk> 
 that should help ibm address the damage that a <unk> storage technology corp. has <unk> in that market

 the white house called on congress to <unk> the proposed capital-gains tax cut to its final deficit-reduction bill but lawmakers seem likely to <unk> at the idea 
 earlier this month the white house endorsed <unk> the controversial tax measure from the bill so that congress could pass quickly a clean bill containing only provisions specifically designed to meet federal budget targets under the gramm-rudman act 
 but now that congress has missed the legal deadline for meeting the gramm-rudman targets the white house said it has returned to its original view that a capital-gains cut should be part of the deficit-reduction bill on which congress continues to work 
 if that does n't happen then we press forward on another vehicle and a separate vote said press secretary marlin fitzwater 
 on capitol hill though there does n't seem to be sufficient sentiment to pair capital gains and the deficit-reduction bill 
 texas rep. william <unk> the ranking republican on the house ways and means committee said i do n't see how we have the votes to place a capital-gains tax cut there 
 meanwhile president bush stepped up his personal lobbying for the capital-gains tax cut 
 the white house said he plans to hold a series of private white house meetings mostly with senate democrats to try to persuade lawmakers to fall in line behind the tax cut 
 the first meeting yesterday was with N senate democrats who have expressed an interest in cutting the tax 
 according to some who attended the senators argued that the president should give the democratic leaders in congress a victory of their own to compensate them for allowing the president to win on the controversial capital-gains issue 
 issues discussed in this context were an increase in the minimum wage and an increase in child-care spending 
 the president was said to have been <unk>

 american telephone & telegraph co. unveiled new optical transmission systems for data video and voice communications 
 two products in what the telecommunications giant called a new generation of such equipment are available now at&t said and three others will be introduced in N and N 
 the products are aimed at a market expected to total more than $ N billion a year in sales by N said morgan <unk> jr. vice president of transmission systems for at&t 
 the products already available are <unk> systems used instead of <unk> of <unk> to <unk> other telecommunications equipment 
 this cuts down greatly on labor mr. <unk> said 
 to be introduced later are a <unk> which will allow several signals to travel along a single optical line a <unk> system which carries voice channels and a network <unk> which directs data flow through <unk> systems 
 at&t said the products unlike previous generations will meet so-called <unk> <unk> standards which at&t expects to be broadly adopted 
 <unk> or <unk> optical network products have more capacity than earlier models 
 these products are the heart of our <unk> line mr. <unk> said 
 he declined to disclose specific prices but said each product costs in the tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of dollars 
 at&t said it expects to beat to the marketplace two rivals northern <unk> ltd. of canada and france 's <unk> n.v. which also have announced <unk> products 
 at&t predicted strong growth in demand for such products 
 it noted that last july nippon telegraph & telephone corp. of japan selected at&t to supply $ N million of such equipment over a four-year period starting next year 
 law firms that have <unk> and grown on the revenue from mergers and acquisitions work are feeling the squeeze as that work declines 
 the disarray in the junk-bond market that began last month with a credit crunch at campeau corp. and the failure of banks to deliver financing for a leveraged buy-out of united airlines parent ual corp. has <unk> through some of the nation 's largest law firms 
 while it is still too early to tell whether the <unk> of takeover activity is only temporary many lawyers say their firms are bracing for lower revenue from merger work which has been so lucrative in the past 
 much of this work was done for higher fees than other legal work and was not generally billed by the hour 
 if deals take longer to complete and there are fewer of them to do you ca n't bill the same kind of premium as when deals took a few weeks from start to finish says one lawyer at a large new york firm 
 we 're planning on a <unk> year in N but next year we 'll be another story said robert <unk> a partner at simpson <unk> & bartlett 
 we 're settling down to a less active period 
 lawyers at such firms as sullivan & <unk> <unk> <unk> & <unk> <unk> lipton rosen & katz and fried frank harris <unk> & jacobson all say they too have experienced a significant slowdown particularly during the past few weeks 
 everyone is waiting to see if deals can be done at <unk> prices and if money is available said jack <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> 
 it 's hard to know right now if the change is fundamental or cyclical 
 some lawyers say the slump while more obvious in recent weeks began earlier this year 
 dennis block a partner at the new york firm of weil <unk> & <unk> said that in the first eight months of this year N hostile offers were launched compared with N for the first eight months of 
 what 's more he said transactions are taking a much longer time to conclude and many fall apart for lack of financing and more <unk> scrutiny by state courts 
 lawyers also say an <unk> stock market and uncertain financing conditions have sharply reduced the number of lucrative big deals likely to be proposed 
 still some lawyers say the mergers slowdown has n't affected foreign buyers as much as domestic ones 
 we just took another floor for our london offices said joseph flom of the new york firm of <unk> <unk> slate <unk> & flom 
 davis <unk> & <unk> also said its international clients are keeping mergers and acquisitions partners busy 
 european companies are looking to buy american ones said henry king the managing partner at that firm 
 but the question is whether things people are looking at will actually surface in live transactions in light of the current market conditions
