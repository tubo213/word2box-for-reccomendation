 this is in response to <unk> kageyama 's manager 's journal looking for the real thing in sony editorial page oct. N 
 though i agree with many of mr. kageyama 's comments i believe he points the gun in the wrong direction it is n't the americans who must be criticized for not understanding the japanese culture but the japanese who insist on forcing their culture on americans 
 the japanese want us to accept their culture but they refuse to accept the american culture 
 japanese managers ca n't expect americans to <unk> as if they were japanese instead they must manage americans as americans 
 americans are expected to conform to the japanese culture when in japan 
 what is wrong with expecting the japanese to conform to american <unk> when they <unk> here 
 americans place native or native <unk> in charge of subsidiaries overseas 
 european <unk> do likewise even in america their affiliates are usually run by american managers 
 but the japanese insist upon japanese managers everywhere they set up shop

 while mr. kageyama does an excellent job of explaining the differences both cultural and <unk> i question his perspective 
 would he suggest that employees of an american company doing business in japan conform to their new bosses ' culture and philosophy 
 obviously not 
 thus the conclusion is that the burden <unk> with management to <unk> the culture and philosophy of the country in which they are operating 
 the workers can be motivated and the company reach its full potential only when management <unk> the employees ' perspective 
 a. <unk> <unk> president municipal code corp <unk> fla 
 i believe mr. kageyama left out one major aspect of japanese culture that <unk> his piece the belief in the <unk> of japanese culture and behavior vs. others 
 a manager should not have to <unk> the opinions of his employees about the style of his management 
 instead he should listen to see how that criticism can be used <unk> to advance his objective of carrying out a set of tasks through the efforts of his subordinates 
 japanese culture vs. american culture is irrelevant 
 the key is how a manager from one culture can <unk> employees from another 
 for mr. kageyama to argue that american employees must <unk> accept a direct <unk> of the japanese way of doing things is outright cultural <unk> of the first order 
 the japanese are <unk> the opportunity to <unk> a new corporate culture based on a fusion of the best aspects of both national <unk> 
 mr. kageyama is accurate to deny a specific <unk> bias 
 it is more difficult to deny a general <unk> in seeing things only the japanese way 
 when the response to criticism is only a better explanation of policies without <unk> the reasons for the criticism i am convinced that mr. kageyama has still failed to attack the root cause of the problem and is simply treating symptoms

 as a presidential candidate in N george bush <unk> expressed his position on abortion in an interview with rolling stone magazine published that march 
 what did he think of the supreme court 's decision <unk> abortion 
 i happen to think it was right mr. bush said <unk> 
 a few months later mr. bush became ronald reagan 's running <unk> 
 suddenly george bush the pro-choice advocate became george bush the <unk> 
 and the <unk> did n't end there 
 just a month ago mr. bush <unk> threatened to veto a pending welfare bill if it provided any abortion funds except to save a woman 's life 
 then two weeks ago declaring that i 'm not looking for any conflict over this the president said he would consider a compromise to fund abortions for poor women in cases of rape and incest 
 but only four days after that mr. bush <unk> the veto threat 
 i do not support federal funding for abortions except where the mother 's life is threatened he proclaimed and finally vetoed the measure last weekend 
 so what does george bush really believe 
 the answer is so <unk> that it is beginning to get this popular president in trouble with each of the increasingly <unk> increasingly powerful sides of the abortion issue 
 the result is <unk> and criticism from all around 
 anti-abortion forces regard him as at best an uncertain ally 
 in all honesty if you ask me is this man a true <unk> i do n't know says john <unk> head of the washington-based ad <unk> committee in defense of life inc 
 yet abortion-rights forces remain bitterly critical 
 douglas gould vice president of communications for the planned <unk> federation of america calls mr. bush 's position on the <unk> issue extremely <unk> adding the guy has n't done one thing about prevention 
 he 's totally geared to a punitive position 
 mr. bush is <unk> uncomfortable with the entire abortion question 
 for most of the past nine years he has <unk> to convince anti-abortion activists of his <unk> support for their position 
 but ever since the supreme court 's webster vs. reproductive health services decision this year changed the political landscape of the abortion issue the president seemingly has tried just as hard to avoid saying anything more unless pressed to the wall 
 many americans still <unk> over their own personal feelings about abortion 
 mr. bush 's problem is n't so much that he seems to be <unk> over the issue as it is that he seems to <unk> on it 
 the political risk would be far less if the president drew a firm line and <unk> to it experts insist 
 if you have a position you 're better off to stick with it than to move around very much says republican strategist john sears 
 the need for <unk> is especially <unk> for mr. bush who mr. sears maintains lacks a strong ideological base 
 by his moderate republican heritage as well as the warnings of political advisers who say the issue is vital to younger voters the president might seem to have at least some <unk> with abortion-rights arguments 
 yet he is also firmly bound by his hard-line rhetoric and promises he made to anti-abortion activists during his long pursuit of the white house 
 on many issues <unk> for instance his keen political <unk> overcome such conflicts 
 but mr. bush and his advisers <unk> the politics of the abortion issue failing to grasp how dramatically the abortion-rights movement would be aroused following last summer 's supreme court decision to restrict those rights in the webster case 
 it was one of the <unk> changes in public attitudes i 've ever seen says former reagan <unk> richard <unk> 
 these days when others raise the subject of abortion the usually <unk> president can be <unk> almost to the point of <unk> 
 ten days ago he was asked to <unk> the reasons behind his anti-abortion stance 
 my position is well-known and <unk> he replied 
 a close look at his record over the last N years suggests that mr. bush has <unk> his views on all sides of the issue 
 in N as the u.s. representative to the united nations he wrote an introduction to a book on world population in which he <unk> of his leadership during his term in congress in expanding <unk> services for the poor 
 running for president in early N he was also quoted as supporting federal funding for abortions in cases of rape incest and to save the life of the mother 
 in his rolling stone interview in N mr. bush <unk> his abortion-rights remarks to contrast himself with his rival ronald reagan 
 in addition to supporting the landmark roe vs. wade supreme court decision <unk> abortion mr. bush said he opposed the constitutional ban on abortion that mr. reagan was promising to promote 
 as mr. reagan 's running <unk> though mr. bush plunged <unk> into the anti-abortion position <unk> a constitutional amendment <unk> abortion 
 he acknowledged only one difference with mr. reagan that the amendment ought to have exceptions for rape and incest as well as to save a woman 's life 
 throughout the early 1980s mr. bush was quoted sometimes supporting federal funding for abortion in cases of rape and incest and sometimes opposing it 
 in april N <unk> president bush had his staff write a letter <unk> out that he would support a constitutional amendment banning abortions except in cases of rape incest and life <unk> but that he opposed federal funding in all but the latter case 
 at the gop convention last year he again came out for an amendment with exceptions for rape incest and life <unk> 
 his rhetoric gathered momentum as he rolled into office <unk> his firm support of our cause during an anti-abortion rally three days after his <unk> last january 
 he again urged passage of a constitutional amendment <unk> abortion 
 but when the high court ruled in the webster case in july the president began to lower the volume 
 when the ruling was handed down the <unk> president dispatched chief of staff john <unk> to issue a statement and refused to answer questions himself 
 he did later threaten <unk> over legislation restoring the district of columbia 's right to use its own tax money to fund abortions for poor women and over restoring funding to the united nations population fund 
 but in the months since then while trying to drum up support for other issues such as an <unk> constitutional amendment he has <unk> away from talking about abortion 
 what few comments he has initiated have been <unk> such as urging greater efforts toward the protection of human life at a meeting of catholic lawyers in boston last month 
 the white house has likewise avoided any involvement in florida 's recent special legislative session on abortion which anti-abortion forces had regarded as a key test of their ability to get state lawmakers to <unk> abortion restrictions 
 the session failed to enact any new curbs 
 now some see mr. bush trapped in a position he is neither comfortable with nor able to escape

 in the year-ago period goodyear had net of $ N million or $ N a share 
 sales rose slightly to $ N billion from $ N billion 
 analysts had mixed responses to the results 
 donald <unk> an independent analyst in new <unk> conn. said he was impressed with the company 's performance 
 he said results were better than he 'd expected and indicate that goodyear is in the midst of a turnaround from a string of lackluster quarters that have plagued the company for a year 
 however harry <unk> an analyst at mcdonald & co. cleveland said goodyear 's results fell at the bottom of his range of estimates 
 excluding an increase in the tax rate and the effects of foreign currency <unk> mr. <unk> said the company 's results were still a little disappointing 
 goodyear 's stock which has been weak in recent weeks fell $ N yesterday to close at $ N a share in composite trading on the new york stock exchange 
 the <unk> <unk> company said pretax operating income in its tire segment jumped about N N to $ N million from $ N million a year earlier reflecting improvements in raw material costs sales of replacement tires and pricing 
 mcdonald 's mr. <unk> said goodyear appeared to have held or gained some market share in the u.s. for the first time since the second quarter of N 
 but goodyear said total u.s. tire unit sales were off about N N 
 total tire segment sales were up only about N N to $ N billion and the company said it reduced manufacturing levels at some of its u.s. tire plants because of inventory adjustments and <unk> production by auto makers 
 in the latest quarter goodyear 's tax rate was N N compared with N N a year earlier 
 as a result total tax outlays were $ N million compared with $ N million the year earlier 
 for the nine months profit skidded about N N reflecting charges taken in this year 's second quarter and the effect of <unk> of weaker foreign currencies into the stronger u.s. dollar 
 net was $ N million or $ N a share compared with net of $ N million or $ N a share the year earlier 
 the latest nine months included charges of $ N million related to the company 's south african subsidiary and unused pipe sold by its crude oil pipeline unit 
 sales rose nearly N N to $ N billion from $ N billion 
 environmental control group inc. said it expects to report minimal earnings or a loss for the third quarter

 former usx corp. chairman david m. roderick may have been lucky he retired last may 
 as he handed over the reins to successor charles a. corry steel profits were close to a cyclical peak 
 though imports were troublesome they were n't running away with the market and american companies had high hopes that steel import quotas would be extended for another five years 
 perhaps most important carl icahn who had once threatened a hostile takeover bid was subdued 
 he and mr. roderick were even <unk> out together 
 today mr. corry <unk> over a company whose fortunes have changed abruptly 
 mr. icahn the company 's <unk> <unk> adversary recently disclosed that he had raised his usx stake to N N and he again threatened a takeover 
 a battle with mr. icahn would <unk> even the most <unk> chief executive to say nothing of one who took the helm less than five months ago 
 in addition usx 's giant steel segment representing N N of its N sales is facing softening demand and slipping prices as well as increasing competition from foreign steelmakers and low-cost minimills 
 the import quotas got only a N 1\/2-year extension and usx is <unk> under a staggering $ N billion debt at a time when it must spend money to upgrade steel mills and drill for oil 
 it 's a <unk> of fire for corry says one usx executive 
 the burning question is whether the new chief can <unk> mr. icahn without being pushed into unwelcome moves 
 mr. corry might have to <unk> the company more than he wants to 
 or he might have to incur a huge expense of either buying mr. icahn 's stock possibly at a premium or paying stockholders a special dividend partly because of mr. icahn 's pressure 
 with his recent purchases of usx common stock mr. icahn shattered a <unk> <unk> standstill agreement with mr. roderick 
 in N mr. roderick <unk> <unk> mr. icahn 's first bullet after the takeover specialist had built up an N N stake 
 mr. roderick did so by having usx redeem a series of guaranteed notes a move that in effect raised the cost of a $ N billion icahn bid by about $ N billion 
 and he managed to fend off further advances and even strike up an unlikely friendship with the <unk> 
 over <unk> at new york 's sky club and links club restaurants the steel executive and the big investor talked steel international trade and thoroughbred horses 
 mr. corry who has <unk> up on corporate raiders by reading t. boone pickens 's <unk> had hoped the <unk> would continue 
 he was shocked associates say to learn of mr. icahn 's new takeover threat 
 both men declined to be interviewed for this article 
 but the fiercely competitive mr. corry quickly showed he 's no <unk> 
 he <unk> with directors at a special meeting two weeks ago and tried to block his opponent 
 although the board believed that mr. icahn is more interested in talking the stock price higher than acquiring usx it adopted a <unk> defense to be <unk> if anyone <unk> a N N stake 
 now it 's mr. icahn 's move 
 will he try to gain a seat on or control of the board and force a radical split of usx into separate oil and steel companies 
 given the weakness of the junk-bond market can he finance a buy-out 
 mr. icahn may not want to sell out unless he can get a special dividend similar to one he received before selling his stake in texaco inc. in june a coup that gave him enough cash to make his usx move 
 and although the recent turmoil in the stock and junk-bond markets by making it harder to arrange takeover financing has eased some of the pressure on mr. corry it does n't end the takeover threat 
 i know it 's not over a <unk> mr. corry acknowledged while <unk> steel suppliers in new york on oct. N and inviting them to a buffet of <unk> and <unk> in honor of kobe steel ltd. usx 's partner in a steel mill in <unk> ohio 
 in fact it 's barely begun for mr. corry who faces tough decisions before he has had a chance to get settled into his new job 
 he 's in a vulnerable position because he has n't established much credibility on his own says <unk> <unk> a securities analyst at painewebber inc 
 the <unk> tax attorney never even <unk> to the job of chief executive 
 an <unk> college student who <unk> in <unk> until he concluded that he could n't stand cutting up <unk> mr. corry wanted to work for a big company that could do big things 
 but after joining the tax department of a usx subsidiary N years ago he set the modest goal of becoming tax manager by the age of N 
 for years he quietly stuck to the back accounting rooms wearing a hat to work because everyone else did 
 i was never a rebel he said in an earlier interview 
 i do n't think most of the people that have been around me would ever say they 've seen me pound the table or get angry 
 yet the <unk> mr. corry helped chart usx 's transition from big steel to big oil 
 he served as mr. roderick 's front man in <unk> negotiations for the N purchase of marathon oil for $ N billion 
 nevertheless mr. corry once named chief executive did n't waste any time <unk> himself from his former boss who still has an office on the <unk> floor of the usx tower in pittsburgh 
 soon after taking over last june mr. corry <unk> a pay cut imposed on <unk> workers a move that mr. roderick had n't made in spite of improved earnings 
 mr. corry also ruled that all board meetings would be held in pittsburgh instead of new york or <unk> ohio marathon 's home 
 and earlier this month he announced the sale of the reserves of texas oil & gas which was acquired three years ago and has n't posted any significant operating profits since 
 one former executive says nobody wanted that deal inside usx except dave roderick who was a hunting and fishing buddy of william l. <unk> chairman of texas oil & gas 
 the executive recalls mr. corry <unk> to him and others remember this was dave 's deal 
 what <unk> many usx executives and shareholders was that the acquisition for $ N billion of stock doubled the usx shares outstanding and considerably diluted them 
 what 's more the takeover occurred as natural-gas prices were falling and just as texas oil & gas reported its first annual loss in N years 
 mr. corry expected the texas oil & gas sale to <unk> mr. icahn by addressing his concern about boosting shareholder value 
 but when the two men met in new york a day after mr. icahn disclosed the rise in his usx stake mr. corry learned that mr. icahn wanted him to sell all of texas oil not just its reserves of about N trillion cubic feet of natural gas and N million barrels of oil but also its pipeline <unk> and <unk> operations 
 that would leave usx with marathon its steel mills and its diversified business segment which includes among other things mineral and transportation products 
 some speculate that mr. corry would agree if he could find a buyer at the right price 
 the problem is that mr. icahn is pushing him to move faster and further in restructuring usx than mr. corry had planned 
 mr. icahn has long believed associates say that the company whose N sales totaled $ N billion is worth $ N a share if broken up 
 the stock closed yesterday at $ N giving mr. icahn 's N million shares a value of $ N billion 
 mr. icahn advocates the sale of the company 's steel operations and mr. corry does n't necessarily disagree 
 unlike his predecessor who saw steel as america 's <unk> mr. corry tends to view it as a <unk> and <unk> business with limited potential associates say 
 in the past five years usx has turned steel into a profit maker by closing several plants and reducing labor costs 
 but the short-term outlook is <unk> 
 it is n't surprising that messrs. roderick and corry view steel so differently 
 while mr. roderick was <unk> in the <unk> of pittsburgh 's smoking mills mr. corry grew up in cincinnati a city <unk> <unk> and more accustomed to pork <unk> than <unk> iron 
 he has never met lynn williams the president of the united steelworkers union and is n't active in the industry 's main trade group the american iron and steel institute which mr. roderick served as chairman 
 dave thought the country needed a strong u.s. steel and while chuck agreed he was more apt to say not at any cost to shareholders a former executive says 
 indeed mr. corry at an august press conference talked about investing in steel as long as it provides a good return and not a day longer 
 however shedding steel would run directly counter to mr. roderick 's original rationale for diversifying into oil and gas having two major products would <unk> the company 's <unk> to one market 's down cycle and help smooth out the flow of cash and earnings 
 as mr. roderick once said we 're a <unk> company and boy if you ca n't figure out the value of those two parts you are so damn <unk> that you do n't belong on wall street 
 moreover the opportunity to sell steel at a price acceptable to usx may be gone for now 
 the time has passed for us to spin off steel either in a public offering or to a buyer one executive contends 
 about the only way that usx now can get out of steel is to <unk> it out piece by piece in separate joint ventures he adds 
 with mr. icahn breathing down his neck however mr. corry may have little choice but to sell at a weak price even if it means losing some <unk> tax-loss <unk> 
 that would leave usx essentially an oil company with marathon as its core 
 marathon has benefited from higher <unk> prices and strong demand for refined products 
 oil has long been mr. corry 's pet 
 indeed when the bush administration finally decided this summer to renew import restrictions <unk> the most important decision to affect the steel industry in five years mr. corry and his directors were aboard <unk> high above marathon 's rich oil reserves in the north sea 
 should usx be left with only marathon mr. corry might well feel pushed to <unk> out other energy companies 
 however even usx executives who work closely with him are n't sure about his long-term goals 
 i do n't think he has a clear sense of where he wants the company to go one says 
 right now the executive adds he wants to continue to focus on paying down usx 's debt by selling assets 
 one thing is certain however mr. corry while studying other options probably wo n't make a major move until he 's clear about mr. icahn 's intentions 
 and then he wo n't panic says j. bruce johnston a former usx executive and now a labor and benefit consultant with <unk> cohen & <unk> in pittsburgh 
 mr. corry learned presence under fire when as vice president of corporate planning he handled what mr. johnston calls <unk> negotiations that led to usx 's shedding of a wide array of assets ranging from chemicals to construction 
 when negotiating mr. corry played his cards close to the <unk> 
 <unk> johnson who worked for mr. corry in strategic planning recalls how his boss would routinely ask a subordinate to research an entire industry to target acquisition candidates 
 what he really wanted to know was about a particular company but you did n't know that 
 he wanted your own <unk> virgin opinion says mr. johnson now managing director at <unk> & co. a <unk> and <unk> firm 
 ever the <unk> mr. corry said in august that he realized that usx is on acquisition screens all over the country 
 it 's part of the <unk> market system that equity can be bought and equity is bought he said 
 usx he noted was formed N years ago by in effect buying out a bunch of other companies 
 people got rich through takeovers in those days as they do today

 u.s. officials however said they are n't buying the israeli argument 
 israeli <unk> officials provided the state department with a <unk> list of recent terrorist incidents they attribute directly to forces controlled by plo chairman <unk> arafat 
 mr. arafat publicly <unk> terrorism dec. N satisfying the u.s. <unk> for a direct dialogue with the plo 
 a u.s. <unk> official said experts are studying the israeli list 
 we have no independent evidence linking <unk> to any acts of terrorism since dec. N N he said referring to the specific plo group that mr. arafat heads 
 so far this list does n't change our view 
 israel wants to end the dialogue but our analysts take a different view than theirs 
 israeli prime minister <unk> shamir 's top adviser on <unk> <unk> <unk> was here monday to present the report to members of congress reporters and others 
 mr. <unk> said he also presented the list last week to william brown u.s. ambassador to israel 
 separately the new york times reported that the israeli government had provided its <unk> in <unk> with different documents that israel said prove the plo has been conducting terrorism from the occupied arab <unk> 
 the state department said it has n't yet seen copies of those papers 
 if the dialogue was based on the assumption that arafat or the plo would stop terrorism and we have evidence of continued terrorism what would be the logical conclusion mr. <unk> asked 
 israel has long claimed mr. arafat never meant to <unk> terrorism particularly because he and his <unk> reserved the right to press armed struggle against the jewish state 
 now <unk> says it is backing up its <unk> with detailed accounts of alleged terrorist acts and plans linked to mr. arafat 
 it blames most of these on <unk> 
 the new accusations come at a delicate time in u.s. efforts to bring about talks between israel and palestinian representatives 
 the state department said it had received a new letter on the subject from israeli foreign minister <unk> <unk> <unk> israel 's previous <unk> to negotiating with any palestinian tied to the plo 
 deciding what <unk> terrorism can be a <unk> exercise 
 the u.s. <unk> it as <unk> politically motivated violence <unk> against <unk> targets by <unk> groups or <unk> state agents 
 to meet the u.s. criteria israel contended it only listed incidents that involved <unk> and occurred inside its <unk> borders 
 at the heart of israel 's report is a list of a dozen incidents <unk> attributes to <unk> including the use of <unk> and <unk> <unk> 
 but u.s. officials say they are n't satisfied these incidents constitute terrorism because they may be <unk> of the <unk> the palestinian <unk> in the occupied <unk> which the u.s. does n't <unk> as terrorism 
 in addition the officials say israel has n't presented convincing evidence these acts were ordered by <unk> or by any group mr. arafat controls 
 u.s. terrorism experts also say they are highly uncertain about the <unk> of the separate documents <unk> to the new york times 
 the papers which israel says were discovered in <unk> <unk> refer to terrorist acts to be carried out in the name of a group called the revolutionary <unk> 
 some supporters of israel say u.s. policy on palestinian terrorism is <unk> by an intense desire to maintain the dialogue with the plo 
 but state department officials accuse israel of <unk> questionable claims to <unk> the u.s.

 by midmorning the <unk> had plunged N points and foreign-exchange dealers quickly drove the dollar down 
 when the <unk> modestly rebounded the dollar bounced back in <unk> dealings but ended the day below the levels of late monday 
 stock prices meanwhile posted significant gains in later trading and closed down by only N points on the day 
 some dealers said that the market 's strong reaction to wall street reflects a general <unk> about the dollar 
 they added that the <unk> 's swift drop proved an easy excuse for the market to drive the u.s. currency in the direction it was already headed

 tom <unk> a vice president with banque paribas in new york sees a break in the dollar 's long-term upward trend a trend that began in january N 
 he argues that the dollar is now moving <unk> adding that the next leg could be the beginning of a longer term bearish phase 
 analysts <unk> the dollar 's recent weakness to an underlying slowdown in the u.s. economy <unk> by recent economic data particularly a surprisingly sharp widening in the august u.s. trade gap 
 they also point out that narrowing interest-rate <unk> between the u.s. and its major trading partners tend to make the u.s. currency less attractive to foreign investors 
 despite several <unk> of dollar trading it was noted that <unk> cross trade grabbed much of the market 's attention 
 following the dive in u.s. stocks the mark has strengthened more than its major counterparts 
 traders attribute the mark 's surge to a robust west german economy and higher rate <unk> 
 but they add that the mark 's strength is in part a reflection of a shift away from u.s. assets by japanese investors into west german investments 
 the question remains how much can the west german market absorb says one senior dealer 
 some dealers say that bank of japan governor <unk> <unk> 's <unk> that japanese monetary policy wo n't be changed for the time being has given investors an added excuse to push the yen down even further against the mark

 boston co. the <unk> financial services concern that was rocked by a management scandal late last year has had a sharp drop in profitability mainly because a high-risk bet on interest rates <unk> 
 boston co. 's fall from grace is bad news for its parent shearson lehman hutton holdings inc. which has relied heavily on the banking and money management unit 's contributions in recent years 
 in N for example boston co. had an estimated pretax profit of at least $ N million while shearson managed net income of just $ N million 
 shearson does n't break out the earnings of its subsidiaries 
 but people familiar with boston co. 's performance say the unit had profit of around $ N million for the third quarter after barely breaking even for the first six months 
 shearson meanwhile posted net income of $ N million for the first nine months of the year down slightly from $ N million for the year-ago period 
 moody 's investors service inc. last week downgraded the long-term deposit rating of boston co. 's boston safe deposit & trust co. subsidiary to single-a-1 from <unk> citing problems in the company 's aggressively managed securities portfolio 
 john <unk> a moody 's vice president said boston safe deposit 's performance has been hurt this year by a <unk> in the maturities of its assets and liabilities 
 the <unk> exposed the company to a high degree of interest-rate risk and when rates moved <unk> beginning late last year and continuing into this year it cost them mr. <unk> said 
 mr. <unk> noted that boston safe deposit has taken some actions to better control <unk> management and improve controls in general and we think these will serve to improve credit quality 
 as some securities mature and the proceeds are reinvested the problems ought to ease he said 
 but he also cited concerns over the company 's mortgage exposure in the troubled new england real estate market 
 boston co. officials declined to comment on moody 's action or on the unit 's financial performance this year except to deny a published report that outside accountants had discovered evidence of significant accounting errors in the first three quarters ' results 
 an accounting controversy at the end of last year forced boston co. to admit it had <unk> pretax profits by some $ N million 
 the resulting scandal led to the <unk> of james n. von <unk> as boston co. 's president and to the resignations of the company 's chief financial officer and treasurer 
 the executives were accused of improperly deferring expenses and <unk> revenue early in an effort to dress up results and perhaps bolster <unk> bonuses 
 mr. von <unk> in turn attributed the controversy to <unk> errors by accountants and accused shearson of conducting a <unk> hunt 
 mr. <unk> of moody 's said the problems in the securities portfolio stem largely from positions taken last year 
 the company 's current management found itself locked into this he said

 sears roebuck & co. is struggling as it enters the critical christmas season 
 yesterday the retailing and financial services giant reported a N N drop in third-quarter earnings to $ N million or N cents a share from a restated $ N million or N cents a share a year earlier 
 but the news was even worse for sears 's core u.s. retailing operation the largest in the nation 
 sears said its u.s. stores had a loss of $ N million their first deficit for the period in more than five years 
 analysts estimated that sales at u.s. stores declined in the quarter too 
 the results underscore sears 's difficulties in <unk> the everyday low pricing strategy that it adopted in march as part of a broad attempt to revive its retailing business 
 under the new approach sears set prices that were somewhere between its old regular and sale prices 
 the company said it would resort far less often to slashing prices to woo shoppers 
 sears officials insist they do n't intend to abandon the everyday pricing approach in the face of the poor results 
 instead a spokesman blames the dismal third-quarter showing on an environment that is being distorted by a very harsh climate for sales of durable goods which account for roughly two-thirds of sears 's annual merchandise volume 
 the new pricing strategy is working the spokesman asserted 
 he added that after an initial surge triggered by an advertising <unk> in march sears expected that the pricing program would n't have any effect on revenue 
 sears has been counting on growth coming from the large displays of <unk> merchandise it is adding to its stores over the next two years in what it calls power <unk> 
 but analysts say sears faces an especially <unk> challenge on the <unk> of the christmas shopping season 
 i believe everyday pricing in the current environment does n't work says walter <unk> of morgan stanley & co. pointing to soft <unk> sales 
 sears is likely to be unsuccessful if it continues with its pricing policy when everyone else is offering unusual values 
 in what amounts to an admission that the transition has n't gone as smoothly as sears had hoped the giant retailer is now trying new ways to drum up business without appearing to abandon its <unk> strategy 
 the company is <unk> more special deals in its advertising and stores and it 's offering to defer finance charges on certain <unk> items 
 sears is also stepping up its television ads and changing its message 
 in a new tv ad for instance a woman going through the sunday newspaper brands as <unk> claims by other stores that they are offering goods for N N N N and N N off 
 by lowering prices throughout its stores she says sears has the right idea 
 but the ad also <unk> sears 's sales a topic that the retailer has avoided since switching to everyday pricing 
 when sears has a sale at a special price the woman in the ad declares it 's something you do n't want to miss 
 recent surveys by leo j. shapiro & associates a market research firm in chicago suggest that sears is having a tough time attracting shoppers because it has n't yet done enough to improve service or its selection of merchandise 
 the number of people who said they were more likely to shop at sears fell in september to N N from N N in march when sears <unk> the <unk> with ads about its new pricing strategy 
 moreover the number of people who <unk> cited lower prices as the reason for their interest in sears declined to N N in september from N N in march 
 just N N of the respondents mentioned brands in september up slightly from N N in march 
 only N N of the people in september cited sears 's friendly personnel 
 the power of price as an appeal which was very considerable in driving traffic in march and april has diminished says george <unk> president of shapiro & associates 
 you see some improvement in these other areas but it 's a very small and slow process 
 for the third quarter sears said its total revenue rose N N to $ N billion from $ N billion a year earlier 
 net income at sears 's merchandise group which includes international and credit card operations as well as u.s. stores fell N N 
 profit at sears 's <unk> insurance unit fell N N to $ N million because of hurricane hugo which <unk> the greatest single storm damage loss in the company 's history 
 sears said claims from the storm as expected reduced its third-quarter net by $ N million or N cents a share 
 <unk> is expected to absorb another big hit in the fourth quarter as claims pour in from the san francisco earthquake 
 but a spokesman said the quake wo n't have as big a financial impact on <unk> as hurricane hugo did 
 net income at sears 's dean witter <unk> services group meanwhile rose nearly N N to $ N million reflecting improvements in its basic stock brokerage and discover credit card businesses 
 profit at sears 's <unk> banker real estate group nearly <unk> to $ N million because of gains on sales of property 
 in new york stock exchange composite trading yesterday sears shares closed at $ N up N cents 
 oil imports to japan rose N N in september from year-earlier levels according to statistics released by the government 's ministry of international trade and industry 
 the imports totaling N million barrels were N N lower than august levels 
 the <unk> rise was partly because of higher demand for petroleum products and partly because of tax changes in N that left oil companies with high inventories in the <unk> period 
 imports of crude from the middle east grew N N from year-earlier levels and southeast asian crude imports grew N N 
 while mideast crude imports were higher compared with year-earlier levels they fell N N compared with august imports 
 southeast asian crude imports however were N N higher than august 
 this is in response to george <unk> 's business world column the housing market is a bigger mess than you think <unk> page sept. N 
 in houston we have seen how bad the housing problem can become 
 unused houses <unk> rapidly affecting the value of nearby homes in a <unk> effect the entire neighborhood can fall victim 
 at this stage some people just walk away from homes where the mortgage exceeds current market value 
 but most of them could have <unk> to keep up their payments they chose not to do so 
 the problem is so vast that we need to try innovative solutions in <unk> experiments 
 here are some ideas 
 N foreclosed homes could be sold by the fha for no down payment the biggest obstacle to young buyers but with personal liability for the mortgage no walking away by choice 
 N encourage long-term <unk> by <unk> one month 's payment off the <unk> end of the mortgage for every six months paid or perhaps have the down payment deferred to the end of the mortgage balloon but <unk> on a monthly <unk> basis as long as the owner remains the <unk> 
 N develop rental agreements with exclusive purchase options for the <unk> 
 an <unk> will in most every case be better for the home and neighborhood than a vacant house 
 in this way the house is not dumped on to a <unk> market

 worse the properties then sit around deteriorating for maybe a year or so but are <unk> eventually because of the <unk> of the low down payment etc to a marginal buyer who ca n't afford both the mortgage and needed repairs and having little vested interest that buyer will walk away and the vicious cycle <unk> itself all over again

 new orders for durable goods fell back slightly in september after shooting up the month before reflecting weakening auto demand after a <unk> of orders for new N models the commerce department reported 
 orders for military equipment household appliances machinery and other goods expected to last at least three years dipped N N last month to $ N billion after leaping N N in august the department said 
 most analysts had expected a sharper decline after the steep rise in august 
 moreover a recent government report showing widespread layoffs in manufacturing had contributed to perceptions that the manufacturing sector of the economy had slowed to a <unk> 
 but many economists pointed to a N N september rise in orders outside the volatile transportation category 
 that suggests the manufacturing sector is not falling apart said <unk> <unk> an economist at manufacturers hanover securities corp. in new york 
 she added however it is not robust by any means 
 while a decline in orders for cars and civilian airplanes pulled down the orders total an enormous jump in orders for heavy military equipment <unk> it up 
 orders for capital defense goods skyrocketed N N and a government analyst said nearly all areas saw increases including airplanes missiles ships tanks and communications equipment 
 orders for military goods usually <unk> in september government officials say as the pentagon <unk> to spend its money before the new fiscal year begins oct. N 
 while all the numbers in the durable goods report were adjusted for seasonal fluctuations a commerce department analyst said that the adjustment probably did n't factor out all of the <unk> surge in defense orders 
 without the increase in defense bookings september orders would have plummeted N N 
 analysts were most unsettled by evidence the backlog of orders at factories is slipping 
 unfilled orders for durable goods rose N N in september to $ N billion after declining for the first time in N N years in august 
 in july unfilled orders grew N N 
 but analysts noted that excluding transportation where what they believe was a temporary surge in auto demand pushed up the figures order backlogs have declined for three months in a row 
 it means we 're eating into the bread that keeps us going 
 that is a little disturbing ms. <unk> said 
 it also means if you have a real <unk> in orders production will likely fall off very quickly because there is less to keep things going 
 capital goods orders outside of the defense sector tumbled for the second month in a row posting a N N drop after a N N decline 
 such steep drops in a category seen as a barometer of business investment would <unk> be grave news for the economy 
 but a commerce department analyst said that in both months orders would have risen had it not been for a drop in civilian aircraft bookings a category that is showing declines only after a huge surge earlier this year 
 still milton hudson senior economic adviser at morgan guaranty trust co. in new york said if you look back a <unk> or so the evidence was pretty good of <unk> strength in the <unk> sector

 still analysts do n't expect the buy-back to significantly affect per-share earnings in the short term 
 the impact wo n't be that great said <unk> <unk> of first boston corp

 japan has climbed up from the <unk> of world war ii and a gross national product of about $ N per capita to reach the <unk> class among industrialized nations 
 now this remarkable economic growth seems to be coming to an end because the government has not converted itself into a modern democratic developed nation mode of operation 
 until N when japan joined the $ N per capita gnp club of the advanced countries it was a model developing nation 
 the government built ports bridges highways schools hospitals and <unk> 
 when industries were weak it protected them 
 it gave the japanese people a value system based on the <unk> that given the country 's lack of natural resources they must work hard to create value through exports and buy food with the surplus 
 individual prosperity inevitably would result 
 that system has worked 
 the standard of living has increased steadily over the past N years more than N N of the people consider themselves middle class

 the ldp won by a <unk> in the last election in july N

 the symptoms all point to one thing japan does not have a modern government 
 its government still wants to sit in the driver 's seat set the speed step on the gas apply the <unk> and steer with N million people in the back seat 
 in a modern system the government 's role is to give the people as much choice as possible and to keep them well informed so they are capable of making a choice 
 it also allows people to buy the best and the cheapest goods from anywhere in the world 
 the japanese government does n't allow this 
 the ministry of agriculture and <unk> actually is a ministry for farmers and <unk> instead of a ministry of provisions 
 the ministry of health and welfare is a ministry of doctors and pharmaceutical companies rather than an organization dedicated to protecting the health of the people 
 the ministry of education is nothing but a <unk> for licensed teachers and certainly does not act on behalf of students 
 the ministry of construction spreads concrete throughout the country and boasts in international conferences that japan 's <unk> roadway per capita is the longest in the world but they seldom think of the poor commuters who spend so much time sitting in traffic 
 the ministry of transportation serves the industry certainly not the passengers who must pay extraordinarily high prices 
 and the ministry of foreign affairs works for itself supporting japanese diplomats who <unk> abundant aid money around the world to ensure that their seat at the dinner table is next to the host 's 
 this ministry has done nothing to correct the <unk> and <unk> that are at the root of japan 's deteriorating image 
 instead it seems to be using foreign pressure and even the trade conflict to expand its <unk> of influence <unk> a <unk> other ministries 
 all this illustrates that japanese ministries still have a provider mentality they do not serve the people and particularly not consumers 
 they serve the industries and the special-interest groups 
 the rest of the world accepted such methods when japan was developing 
 japanese put up with it because the government provided job stability and growing <unk> 
 japan is not a political country 
 it is a bureaucratic country 
 the diet plays a minor role compared with the powerful bureaucratic system 
 most bills are drafted by bureaucrats not politicians 
 the diet does n't normally even debate bills because the opposition parties are so often opposed to whatever ldp does that it would be a waste of time 
 so most bills are passed without full discussion particularly difficult bills are passed in the absence of the opposition parties 
 a recent example is the N N consumption tax on all commercial activities 
 this makes enormous sense in japan where direct tax accounts for more than N N of revenues and the capture rate of direct tax is so unfair 
 if you are a <unk> man <unk> N N captured 
 if you are a retailer N N and a farmer N N 
 to correct this <unk> most people would have favored an indirect tax like the consumption tax 
 but the bill was passed without debate in the diet in the absence of the opposition

 now is the time to reform the government from a provider developing-country vanguard role to that of a modern industrialized nation in which consumers have the ultimate choice 
 if the ldp as currently composed ca n't make the <unk> then it should split into two parties 
 one party could stand for consumer interests small government free trade and <unk> to put japan clearly among the most developed and open countries 
 the other party could continue on the traditional track of the ldp representing the manufacturers ' preference for larger government control regulation and <unk> 
 the ldp must make a decision immediately lower house elections must take place before june

 more than twice as many red delicious apples are grown as the golden variety america 's no. N apple 
 but the apple industry is <unk> for change 
 red delicious has been <unk> and its prices have dropped below the cost of production says washington state 's mr. norton 
 the scare over <unk> a growth regulator that makes apples <unk> and <unk> but may be <unk> made consumers shy away from the delicious though they were less affected than the <unk> 
 the <unk> and <unk> lower prices combined with cancer fears was a very serious blow to growers

 one may be william broderick a sterling mass. grower 
 this is beautiful stuff he says looking <unk> at big boxes of <unk> red delicious next to his <unk>

 even if a grower <unk> them back his $ N <unk> <unk> might <unk> off to the neighbors ' <unk> instead of <unk> his mr. broderick says 
 though growers ca n't always keep the worm from the apple they can protect themselves against the price <unk> of any one variety by diversifying into the recently imported <unk> a sweet new zealand native the <unk> <unk> reportedly thomas jefferson 's favorite apple <unk> kinds like the liberty 
 i 've <unk> out a lot of delicious and <unk> the trees with many different <unk> says steve wood a west lebanon n.h. grower <unk> through his <unk> poverty lane <unk> on a <unk> autumn day recently

 it 's a real dog 
 supermarkets are getting into the variety act too 
 they still buy apples mainly for big red good looks that 's why so many taste like <unk> ' <unk> bags 
 but <unk> counts more than it once did and stores are expanding shelf space for <unk> but <unk> and often <unk> apples 
 rather than sell <unk> delicious maybe we can sell <unk> fujis says chuck <unk> <unk> director for <unk> <unk> inc. a minneapolis supermarket chain and food distributor 
 the fuji is a product of <unk> japanese <unk> engineering which <unk> it N years ago at a government research <unk> 
 japanese researchers have <unk> dozens of <unk> of fujis to <unk> its color taste and shelf life 
 now the best of them age as <unk> as <unk> the industry 's gold standard for <unk> 
 in the <unk> of <unk> apples the fuji 's track record stands out during the past N years it has gone from almost <unk> to some N N of japan 's market 
 the japanese apple market is very <unk> to high quality says david lane a scientist at a canadian <unk> research center in <unk> british columbia and so apples are more of a <unk> there than a big food commodity 
 the u.s. department of agriculture estimates that this year americans will eat about N N more fresh apples per capita than the japanese 
 the fuji is still small potatoes in the u.s. sold mainly in fruit <unk> 
 but in california says craig <unk> a <unk> grower there 's a fuji apple <unk> 
 once somebody <unk> one they get <unk> 
 mr. <unk> the washington grower says that he could sell fujis to taiwan buyers at $ N a box if he had them 
 taiwan already is a big importer of fujis from other places he adds 
 but his first crop wo n't be picked till next year 
 i expect to see the demand exceed supply for fujis for the next N to N years he adds 
 washington red delicious by the way are <unk> for less than $ N a box these days 
 mr. <unk> sees fujis in part as striking a blow against the <unk> of u.s. apples by supermarkets 
 when the chain stores took over there was no longer a connection between grower and consumer 
 a guy is sitting up in an office deciding what you 're going to eat 
 after all until the 1950s even the red delicious was a firm <unk> <unk> 
 then as growers <unk> them more for looks and to satisfy supermarket chains ' demands of long-term storage the red went into decline 
 now those red <unk> things stores sell in summer are <unk> lovely but usually not good eating 
 they do deserve respect however they are almost a year old probably equal to about N in human years 
 the fuji to be sure has <unk> too 
 it <unk> later than most apples and growing it in u.s. areas with <unk> <unk> may be tricky 
 moreover the <unk> fuji must compete with an increasingly <unk> delicious 
 mr. broderick the massachusetts grower says the big boss at a supermarket chain even rejected his red delicious recently because they were n't <unk> and brushed for extra <unk> 
 and he had n't used <unk> which many growers employ to <unk> their delicious apples for greater eye appeal 
 still mr. <unk> points out <unk> became popular without big red looks so why not fujis 
 he sees a shift in american values at least regarding apples toward more emphasis on substance and less on <unk> 
 taste has finally come to the <unk> he says

 few people are aware that the federal government <unk> almost as much money as it <unk> 
 from N to N while federal budget deficits totaled $ N trillion the government issued $ N billion of new direct loans and an additional $ N billion of new primary loan guarantees 
 these figures <unk> secondary guarantees deposit insurance and the activities of <unk> enterprises a huge concern in its own right as detailed on this page may N 
 federal credit programs date back to the new deal and were meant to break even financially 
 since the 1950s federal lending has experienced extraordinary growth in credit volume subsidy rates and policy applications spurred on by the growth of government in general and budget <unk> and deceptive management in particular 
 as we will see many of these obligations do n't show up as part of the federal deficit 
 but recent events indicate that federal credit is out of control 
 student loan defaults remain high at about N N and the program has been rocked by allegations of fraud and <unk> 
 farmers home administration <unk> loans have turned into de <unk> <unk> programs losses over the next three years are expected to exceed $ N billion 
 defaults on veterans affairs loan guarantees have <unk> in the past eight years 
 last month the general accounting office reported that defaults in federal housing administration guarantees were five times as high as previously estimated and that fha 's equity fell to minus $ N billion 
 <unk> 's findings are particularly troubling because the fha has about $ N billion in obligations outstanding and had previously been considered one of the most financially secure credit programs 
 scores of other credit programs subsidizing agriculture small business exporters defense energy transportation and others are less visible but in no better shape 
 if the programs continue their present path the potential government losses are staggering the federal government holds $ N billion in direct loans outstanding and backs an additional $ N billion in primary guarantees 
 secondary guarantees of pools of fha and <unk> loans by the agency known as ginnie mae currently exceed $ N billion 
 although external events have contributed to the <unk> the principal causes of the current crisis are internal and generic to all programs 
 to reduce the risks while still retaining the legitimate benefits these programs can provide credit policy must N use credit to improve the operation of capital markets not to provide subsidies 
 there is a fundamental conflict between providing a subsidy and maintaining the integrity of a credit program 
 if the program is meant to provide a subsidy collecting the debt <unk> the original goal 
 thus subsidized loans tend to turn into <unk> programs with increasing subsidy and default rates over time 
 to avoid this problem government should issue credit only if it intends to use every legal method to collect 
 in contrast credit programs can be appropriate tools to improve the operation of capital markets 
 for example legal restrictions on interstate banking once <unk> the supply of credit to the agricultural sector 
 farm lending was enacted to correct this problem by providing a <unk> flow of <unk> funds 
 however this in no way justifies the huge government subsidies and losses on such loans 
 credit policy should separate these two competing objectives and eliminate aspects that provide the subsidy 
 for example student loans currently attempt to subsidize college attendance and <unk> problems created by the fact that students ' future earnings are not accepted as collateral 
 the program provides highly subsidized loans to any student whose family earns less than a particular amount 
 high default rates a low interest rate and government coverage of all interest costs while the student is in school make program costs extremely high 
 families that do not need the loan can make money simply by putting the loan in the bank and paying it back when the student graduates 
 in contrast a student loan program that was meant solely to correct <unk> <unk> would allow loans for any student regardless of family income at market or <unk> rates 
 while the student was in school interest costs would either be paid by the student or added to the loan balance 
 this program combined with cash grants to <unk> students would reduce program costs and much more effectively target the intended beneficiaries 
 N provide better incentives 
 given the structure of most credit programs it is surprising that default rates are not even higher 
 guarantee rates are typically N N giving lenders little reason to screen customers carefully 
 reducing those rates moderately say to N N would still provide substantial assistance to borrowers 
 but it would also encourage lenders to choose more <unk> customers and go a long way toward reducing defaults 
 for example the small business administration has had reasonable success in reducing both guarantee rates and default rates in its preferred lenders ' program 
 borrowers ' incentives are equally <unk> 
 since the government has a dismal record of collecting bad debts the costs to the <unk> of <unk> are usually low 
 in addition it is often possible to obtain a new government loan even if existing debts are not paid off 
 simple policy <unk> in this case would be to improve debt collection taking the <unk> off contracted collection agencies and to deny new credit to <unk> 
 these provisions would be difficult to enforce for a program intended to provide a subsidy but would be reasonable and effective devices for programs that attempt to offset market <unk> 
 N record the true costs of credit programs in the federal budget 
 since the budget measures cash flow a new $ N direct loan is treated as a $ N expenditure even though at least part of the loan will be paid back 
 loan guarantees do n't appear at all until the <unk> defaults so new guarantees do not raise the deficit even though they create future liabilities for the government 
 by converting an expenditure or loan to a guarantee the government can ensure the same flow of resources and reduce the current deficit 
 predictably guarantees outstanding have risen by $ N billion since N while direct loans outstanding have fallen by $ N billion 
 the true budgetary cost of a credit subsidy is the discounted value of the net costs to government 
 this figure could be estimated using techniques employed by private lenders to forecast losses or determined by selling loans to private owners without federal guarantees 
 neither technique is perfect but both are better than the current system which <unk> the costs of new credit programs by amounts that vary substantially and average about $ N billion annually according to the congressional budget office 
 a budget that reflected the real costs of lending would eliminate incentives to convert spending or lending programs to guarantees and would let taxpayers know what congress is committing them to 
 N impose standard accounting and administrative practices 
 creative accounting is a <unk> of federal credit 
 many agencies roll over their debt paying off <unk> loans by issuing new loans or converting defaulted loan guarantees into direct loans 
 in any case they avoid having to write off the loans 
 some agencies simply keep bad loans on the books as late as N the <unk> bank held in its portfolio at face value loans made to cuba in the 1950s 
 more seriously <unk> has carried several billion dollars of defaulted loans at face value 
 until <unk> 's recent audit fha books had not been subject to a complete external audit in N years 
 the administration of federal credit should closely parallel private lending practices including the development of a loan loss reserve and regular outside audits 
 establishing these practices would permit earlier <unk> of emerging financial crises provide better information for loan sales and <unk> decisions and reduce fraud 
 government lending was not intended to be a way to <unk> spending figures hide fraudulent activity or provide large subsidies 
 the reforms described above would provide a more limited but <unk> safer and ultimately more useful role for government as a lender 
 without such reforms credit programs will continue to be a large-scale high-risk proposition for taxpayers

 the bush administration said it is <unk> a comprehensive proposal for <unk> agricultural trade that could help break an <unk> in the current round of <unk> trade negotiations 
 the proposal <unk> the u.s. desire to scrap or reduce a host of <unk> subsidies on farm products 
 but it would allow considerable flexibility in determining how and when these goals would be achieved 
 the u.s. plan also would ease the transition to <unk> agriculture trade by allowing some countries to convert <unk> barriers into tariffs that together with existing tariffs then would be phased out over N years 
 trade representative carla hills who along with agriculture secretary <unk> <unk> unveiled the proposal said she is confident it will gain considerable support from the u.s. 's trading partners 
 mr. <unk> seeking to <unk> european objections to an earlier u.s. plan that called for eliminating all <unk> barriers by the year N said the new u.s. proposal would n't put farmers out of business but would only encourage them to grow what the markets desire instead of what the government wants 
 the u.s. is <unk> the proposal today in geneva hoping that the initiative will spur members of the general agreement on tariffs and trade to reach agreement on new trade rules before their current negotiating round concludes in december N 
 another u.s. proposal filed monday urges more fair play in services trade including predictable and clear rules and <unk> in the treatment of foreign and domestic service companies 
 unlike the earlier u.s. <unk> proposal which struck european countries as too extreme the latest plan would provide some room for maneuver 
 for instance the new u.s. package makes clear there would be a transition period during which gatt members could use a combination of tariffs and quotas to cushion their farmers from foreign competition 
 it also says countries could temporarily raise tariffs on certain products if they experience an unusually heavy volume of imports 
 instead of proposing a complete elimination of farm subsidies as the earlier u.s. proposal did the new package calls for the elimination of only the most <unk> ones 
 less <unk> ones would be subject only to some restraints and others with a relatively minor trade impact would be allowed to continue under certain conditions 
 the new u.s. plan also would establish procedures to prevent countries from using health and <unk> rules to <unk> trade <unk> 
 the goal would be to resolve disputes such as one prompted by the european community 's current attempt to bar imports of beef from <unk> u.s. cattle 
 the u.s. contends that the rules are n't justified on health grounds 
 to encourage more competition among exporting countries the u.s. is proposing that export subsidies including tax incentives for exporters be phased out in five years 
 procter & gamble co. helped by a gain from a lawsuit settlement and continued growth overseas posted a N N rise in fiscal first-quarter net income

 excluding the gain p&g 's earnings were close to analysts ' predictions of about $ N a share for the quarter 
 wall street had expected a modest rise in the company 's domestic sales and earnings and more substantial increases in overseas results 
 one factor helping sales and earnings was a N N price rise for most p&g products except coffee analysts said 
 unit volume or amount of products shipped rose about N N in the international segment with p&g continuing to win market share in japan 's diaper and detergent markets 
 jay <unk> analyst with kidder peabody & co. said p&g 's always <unk> <unk> sold under the <unk> name in japan has firmly established itself as a leading brand 
 he figures p&g will expand its <unk> product line in japan to continue that momentum 
 p&g 's u.s. shipments were up just N N partly because the company decided to shift more promotions and sales for health and beauty products to the fiscal second quarter 
 <unk> <unk> analyst with salomon bros. predicts the shift will mean p&g 's sales growth in the second quarter will be in the double <unk> 
 also slowing growth in the u.s. were lackluster results for p&g 's cooking oils which had a strong year-earlier first quarter

 the voting rights act of N was enacted to keep the promise of the <unk> amendment and enable southern blacks to go to the polls <unk> by <unk> tests and other <unk> devices 
 <unk> years later the voting rights act has been transformed by the courts and the justice department into a program of racial gerrymandering designed to increase the number of blacks and other minorities hispanics <unk> and native americans holding <unk> office 
 in the 1980s the justice department and lower federal courts that enforce the voting rights act have required state legislatures and municipal governments to create the maximum number of safe minority election districts districts where minorities form between N N and N N of the voting population 
 the program has even been called upon to create safe white electoral districts in municipalities where whites are the minority 
 although section N of the act <unk> <unk> requiring that minorities win a <unk> share of <unk> offices few municipal and state government plans achieve <unk> by the justice department or survive the scrutiny of the lower federal courts unless they <unk> out as many <unk> minority districts as possible 
 the new goal of the voting rights act more minorities in political office is <unk> 
 for the political process to work all citizens regardless of race must feel represented 
 one essential indicator that they are is that members of minority groups get elected to public office with reasonable frequency 
 as is blacks constitute N N of the population but fewer than N N of elected leaders 
 but racial gerrymandering is not the best way to accomplish that essential goal 
 it is a quick fix for a complex problem 
 far from promoting a <unk> of interests among black white hispanic and other minority voters drawing the district lines according to race suggests that race is the voter 's and the candidate 's most important <unk> 
 such a policy implies that only a black politician can speak for a black person and that only a white politician can govern on behalf of a white one 
 examples of the divisive effects of racial gerrymandering can be seen in two cities new york and birmingham <unk> 
 when they <unk> their districts after the N census every other <unk> and state in the country will face this issue 
 new york city 
 racial gerrymandering has been a familiar policy in new york city since N when congress first amended the voting rights act to expand its reach beyond the southern states 
 in N the justice department required that the electoral <unk> in the borough of brooklyn be <unk> to concentrate black and hispanic votes despite protests that the new electoral <unk> would split a neighborhood of <unk> <unk> into two different districts 
 this year a commission appointed by the mayor to revise new york 's system of government completed a new charter expanding the city council to N from N members 
 sometime in N as soon as the N census becomes available a <unk> panel will <unk> the city council district lines 
 the charter revision commission has made it clear that in response to the expectations of the justice department and the commission 's own commitment to <unk> minority political leadership the new district lines will be drawn to maximize the number of <unk> minority districts 
 blacks and hispanics currently make up N N of the city 's population and hold only N N of the seats on the council 
 several of the city 's black leaders including democratic mayoral <unk> david dinkins have spoken out for racial gerrymandering to accord blacks and hispanics the <unk> opportunity for representation 
 in this connection it is important to note that several members of new york 's sitting city council represent <unk> districts that bring together sizable black hispanic and <unk> white <unk> <unk> <unk> 's <unk> district in northern manhattan and the south bronx and susan alter 's <unk> district in brooklyn for example 
 to win their seats on the council these political leaders have had to listen to all the voices in their district and devise public policies that would benefit all 
 often they have found that the relevant issue is not race but rather housing crime prevention or education 
 birmingham ala. 
 the unusual situation in birmingham <unk> illustrates the divisive consequences of <unk> out safe districts for racial minorities 
 in birmingham which is N N black whites are the minority 
 insisting that they are protected by the voting rights act a group of whites brought a federal suit in N to demand that the city abandon <unk> voting for the nine member city council and create nine electoral districts including four safe white districts 
 the white group argued that whites were not fully and fairly represented because in <unk> elections only black candidates or white candidates who <unk> to black interests could win 
 no federal court has ruled that the voting rights act protects a white minority but in june the justice department approved a <unk> plan for birmingham that <unk> out three <unk> districts and six <unk> districts 
 richard <unk> birmingham 's black mayor <unk> the consequences 
 in the past people who had to run for office had to moderate their views because they could n't afford to <unk> blacks or whites he said 
 now you go to districts you 're likely to get candidates whose views are more extreme white and black on racial issues 
 two hundred years ago critics of the new united states constitution warned that the electoral districts for congress were too large and <unk> too many different economic interests 
 a small farmer and a <unk> merchant could not be represented by the same spokesman they said 
 but james madison <unk> that argument in one of the most <unk> political <unk> ever written no. N of the <unk> papers 
 madison explained that a representative 's duty was to speak not for the narrow interests of one group but instead for the common good 
 large <unk> election districts would encourage good government said madison because a representative would be <unk> to serve the interests of all his constituents and be <unk> to none 
 madison 's noble and <unk> vision of the representative still can guide us 
 as long as we believe that all americans of every race and ethnic background have common interests and can live together <unk> our political <unk> should reflect our belief 
 racial gerrymandering creating separate black and white districts says that we have discarded that belief in our ability to live together and govern ourselves as one people 
 ms. <unk> is a constitutional scholar at the center for the study of the presidency in new york 
 the justice department has distributed these new guidelines for u.s. attorneys <unk> rico cases 
 a related editorial appears today 
 under rico the government may seek a temporary <unk> order tro upon the filing of a rico indictment in order to preserve all <unk> assets until the trial is completed and judgment entered 
 such orders can have a <unk> impact on third parties who do business with the defendants including clients vendors banks investors creditors dependents and others 
 some highly publicized cases involving rico <unk> have been the subject of considerable criticism in the press because of a perception that pre-trial <unk> of assets is <unk> to a seizure of property without due process 
 in order to ensure that the rights of all interested parties are protected the criminal division has instituted the following requirements to control the use of <unk> in rico prosecutions 
 it should be noted that these requirements are in addition to any other existing requirements such as review by the asset forfeiture office 
 N as part of the approval process for rico prosecutions the prosecutor must submit any proposed forfeiture tro for review by the organized crime and racketeering section 
 the prosecutor must show that <unk> <unk> such as bonds are not likely to preserve the assets for forfeiture in the event of a conviction 
 N in seeking approval of a tro the prosecutor must <unk> any anticipated impact that forfeiture and the tro would have on innocent third parties balanced against the government 's need to preserve the assets 
 N in deciding whether forfeiture and hence a tro is appropriate the section will consider the nature and <unk> of the <unk> the government 's policy is not to seek the <unk> forfeiture permissible under the law where that forfeiture would be disproportionate to the defendant 's crime 
 the division expects that the prosecutor will announce these principles either at the time the indictment is returned or at the latest at the first proceeding before the court concerning the tro 
 sales of north <unk> cars and trucks plunged N N in mid-october from a year earlier as domestic manufacturers paid the price for heavy incentives earlier this year 
 people are waiting for new factory <unk> said ben <unk> sales manager of bob <unk> auto world in lynn mass. whose sales are slow 
 this trend appears to be especially true at general motors corp. which used both dealer and consumer incentives to <unk> sales in august and september 
 since then deliveries have slumped 
 gm 's car sales dropped N N in mid-october to N while truck sales fell N N to N 
 gm also had dismal results in the first N days of the month while other auto makers reported mixed results 
 all of the big three suffered in the <unk> period however with sales of all domestically made cars including those built at <unk> plants falling N N to N from a year earlier 
 the seasonal adjusted annual selling rate was six million vehicles a small improvement from the N million rate of early october but a big drop from the N million rate a year ago 
 sales of domestically made trucks also continued to be sluggish in mid-october dropping N N to N from a year ago 
 the big three auto makers already have slashed fourth-quarter production plans N N below year-ago levels but that may not be enough to prevent inventories from ballooning if sales do n't improve 
 industry analyst john h. <unk> a vice president with hill & <unk> in st. louis forecasts that domestic auto makers will have a <unk> supply of cars at the end of the year even if car sales improve to a N million vehicle rate for the quarter 
 ford motor co. reported a N N drop in sales of <unk> cars to N and a N N drop in domestic trucks to N

 the no. N u.s. auto maker had a N N plunge in car sales to N and a N N drop in truck sales to N which include its minivans and <unk> 
 honda motor co. which continues to have short supplies of domestically made accords saw its sales of north <unk> cars fall N N to N 
 but sales of domestic cars and trucks at nissan motor corp. rose N N to N 
 a nissan spokesman attributed the increase to the use of incentives this year and not a year ago and to higher fleet sales 
 toyota motor corp. which opened a plant in <unk> ky. last year saw sales triple to N vehicles

 short interest in nasdaq over-the-counter stocks rose N N as of mid-october its biggest jump since N N last april 
 the most recent otc short interest statistics were compiled oct. N the day the nasdaq composite index slid N N and the new york stock exchange tumbled N N 
 the <unk> might lead to the conclusion that <unk> bet heavily on that day that otc stocks would decline further 
 as it happens the nasdaq composite did continue to fall for two days after the initial plunge 
 however the short interest figures reported by brokerage and securities clearing firms to the national association of securities dealers include only those trades completed or settled by oct. N rather than trades that occurred on that day according to gene <unk> chief economist for the nasd 
 generally it takes five business days to transfer stock and to take the other steps necessary to settle a trade 
 the total short interest in nasdaq stocks as of mid-october was N million shares up from N million in september but well below the record level of N million shares established in july N 
 the sharp rise in otc short interest compares with the N N decline in short interest on the new york stock exchange and the N N rise on the american stock exchange during the <unk> period 
 generally a short seller expects a fall in a stock 's price and aims to profit by selling borrowed shares that are to be replaced later the short seller hopes the replacement shares bought later will cost less than those that were sold 
 short interest which represents the number of shares borrowed and sold but not yet replaced can be a <unk> barometer for many stocks 
 among N of the largest otc issues short interest rose to N million shares from N million in N stocks in september 
 big stocks with large short interest gains as of oct. N included first executive intel campeau and lin broadcasting 
 short interest in first executive an insurance issue rose N N to N million 
 intel 's short interest jumped N N while campeau 's increased N N 
 intel makes semiconductors and campeau operates department-store chains and is <unk> for cash 
 <unk> savings again had the dubious honor of being the otc stock with the biggest short interest position on nasdaq 
 <unk> has headed the list since may 
 first executive and troubled valley national corp. of arizona were next in line 
 short selling is n't necessarily bad for the overall market 
 <unk> shares must eventually be replaced through buying 
 in addition changes in short interest in some stocks may be caused by arbitrage 
 for example an investor may seek to profit during some takeover situations by buying stock in one company involved and <unk> the stock of the other 
 two big stocks involved in takeover activity saw their short interest surge 
 short interest in the american depositary receipts of jaguar the target of both ford motor and general motors more than doubled 
 nasdaq stocks that showed a drop in short interest included adobe systems class a shares of tele-communications and takeover targets <unk> and <unk>

 short interest in N <unk> securities totaled N million shares compared with almost N million shares in N issues in september 
 the october short interest represents N days of average daily trading volume in the smaller stocks in the system for the reporting period compared with N day a month ago

 what defeated general aoun was not only the weight of the syrian army 
 the weight of lebanon 's history was also against him and it is a history israel is in danger of <unk>

 its best hope of acceptance by its <unk> lies in reaching a settlement with the <unk> 
 like lebanon israel is being <unk> by <unk> 
 in greater israel more than half the children under six are <unk> 
 within N years <unk> will probably be the minority 
 yet israel will neither share power with all these arabs nor says its present prime minister <unk> its borders closer to its <unk> jewish <unk> 
 by not choosing one of these options <unk> will condemn themselves as the <unk> did to perpetual war with the <unk> in their midst and so to the internal erosion of their state 
 unlike the <unk> israel 's <unk> will not let themselves become the weakest force in a system of private <unk> <unk> will become <unk> before it becomes <unk>

 the nasdaq over-the-counter market did n't fully recover from a selling <unk> and closed down N N

 the market started with several strikes against it said peter dapuzzo head of retail equity trading at shearson lehman hutton referring to news that the labor-management buy-out of ual corp. continued to <unk> and reports that the junk-bond market is <unk> 
 but the computer-guided selling in response to those developments dealt a serious blow to the over-the-counter market mr. dapuzzo said 
 even though the over-the-counter market usually does n't fall by as much as listed stocks during <unk> <unk> he said when the market does recover the damage is done and it leaves nasdaq down more than the big board 
 mr. dapuzzo also complained that the sharp swings in stock prices lately is scaring away retail and foreign investors 
 while shearson does n't do computer-guided program trading for its own account the firm does execute orders for clients involved in the buying and selling of shares tied to movements in certain stock indexes mr. dapuzzo acknowledged 
 the volatility inherent in program trading troubled other traders too 
 they do n't like the risks they are forced to assume when prices swing so drastically 
 market makers are supposed to keep supplies of stocks on hand to maintain orderly trading when imbalances occur 
 that means that on days when prices are tumbling and sellers <unk> they must be willing to buy shares from sellers when no one else will 
 in such an environment a market maker can absorb huge losses 
 but the recent volatility in stock prices caused by the program trading has made some market makers less willing to <unk> up the stocks that are for sale 
 the market makers say they are n't comfortable carrying big positions in stocks because they realize prices can tumble quickly 
 the situation makes it harder to buy and sell shares quickly <unk> the rise and fall in stock prices during <unk> trading

 without question something intriguing is going on in the policy chambers of the politburo 
 as it bids for new agreements new loans and indeed admission to the <unk> world the soviet government has recognized it has a credibility problem 
 so after N years it is <unk> the obvious hoping to be believed about other things 
 it 's not enough 
 if the soviets want to be believed they need to start telling the truth about more than the totally obvious 
 our own test of glasnost 's <unk> would be a soviet decision to open itself to a complete international examination of one of the most troubling <unk> in u.s.-soviet relations the reported N anthrax <unk> at a soviet military facility in sverdlovsk 
 the u.s. government has never <unk> in its assessment of this incident as an accident at a biological weapons facility there and hence a violation of the N biological weapons convention 
 the pentagon 's recently issued soviet military power though in general adopting a softer line repeated the sverdlovsk assessment 
 it also was detailed in congressional testimony this past february an explosion at the <unk> and <unk> institute in sverdlovsk released anthrax <unk> that caused a significant number of deaths 
 since mr. shevardnadze did not address this topic before the supreme soviet the soviet union 's official position remains that the anthrax deaths were caused by tainted meat 
 we doubt this claim just as we <unk> mr. shevardnadze 's assurance last year that krasnoyarsk did n't violate the abm treaty 
 and just as we did not believe the <unk> claims of the congressmen and arms-control advocates who visited krasnoyarsk we are in no way persuaded by the <unk> to the <unk> theory by a u.s. team of scientists who met with soviet counterparts in washington last year 
 the soviets ' explanation is that the anthrax came from one lot of animal feed made from the <unk> of cattle that <unk> on soil that was naturally infected with anthrax <unk> 
 harvard 's <unk> <unk> who we read has sold something called the scientific community on the notion that yellow rain attacks on the <unk> <unk> were in fact the result of <unk> <unk> by giant <unk> found the soviet anthrax scenario completely <unk> 
 we do n't believe it 
 and we certainly do not believe that mr. gorbachev or any of his <unk> yet deserve to have the west take their word for it 
 sverdlovsk is a large gray cloud over glasnost and indeed over the legitimacy of the arms-control process itself 
 the u.s. government 's sverdlovsk complaint as with krasnoyarsk is no mere political <unk> 
 biological weapons violations have figured little in political debate and indeed have not been pressed vigorously enough by the u.s. government 
 but the stated u.s. position is detailed and specific and the prospect of biological <unk> is <unk> <unk> 
 the soviets should be willing to set in motion a process that would allow them to acknowledge that sverdlovsk violated the N agreement or alternatively that would give u.s. specialists reasonable confidence that this was a wholly civilian accident 
 until that happens glasnost can not begin to deserve the kind of credibility mr. shevardnadze was bidding for with his <unk> on monday 
 manville corp. said it offered to buy $ N million of its convertible preferred stock from the manville personal injury settlement trust in a move that would improve the trust 's liquidity and reduce the potential number of manville shares outstanding 
 manville said it made the offer within the past several weeks as part of an effort to improve shareholder value 
 it said it would purchase the stock at market price 
 manville and a spokeswoman for the trust said that the two are discussing the proposal but a decision has n't been made 
 we are considering that offer along with all other alternatives the trust spokeswoman said 
 we need to look at how to maximize our cash flow to pay our beneficiaries 
 the trust created as part of manville 's bankruptcy-law reorganization to compensate victims of <unk> diseases owns N million of the series a convertible preferred shares which are each convertible into N manville common shares 
 the trust also owns half of manville 's N million common shares outstanding 
 based on manville 's closing price yesterday of $ N a share manville 's offer would purchase about N million of its preferred shares or about N N of the trust 's preferred stock holding 
 in addition to the stock and N N of manville 's profits beginning in N the trust is supposed to receive $ N billion over its <unk> life 
 but it initially was funded with about $ N million and may soon face a cash crunch 
 as of june N it had settled about N of N claims filed and its unpaid claims totaled $ N million a large portion of its $ N million in cash and <unk> securities 
 since most of its assets are tied to manville a forest and building products concern the trust might also want to diversify its holdings

 a manville spokesman would n't elaborate on the proposed changes

 the biggest change in northeast 's offer was in improvements made for equity holders who had been given short <unk> previously 
 assuming full operation of the seabrook nuclear power plant which is completed but is n't yet operating equity holders would receive up to $ N million in cash preferred stock and new 10-year seabrook bonds 
 northeast 's previous offer had proposed that equity holders receive just $ N million 
 in addition northeast promised the state of new hampshire that rate increases would be limited to N N annually for seven years 
 its previous proposal had <unk> rate limits on seabrook operations and other <unk> 
 wilbur ross financial adviser to the equity holders said given the state 's strong bargaining position we believe the <unk> plan provides the best recovery available to ps of new hampshire 's equity holders 
 officials of ps of new hampshire could n't be reached for comment 
 the company has filed an internal reorganization plan it valued at $ N billion that would require N N rate increases

 new england electric system <unk> mass. has proposed buying the company for $ N billion as part of a plan that would require rate increases of only N N annually for seven years 
 the state of new hampshire has favored that plan 
 the other bidder is united illuminating co. new haven conn. with a bid valued at $ N billion and and a proposal for seven years of N N rate increases 
 the polish <unk> will eat well this winter 
 tons of <unk> <unk> potatoes <unk> and wheat will fill damp <unk> across the land as thousands of farmers turn the state 's buyers away 
 many a <unk> wo n't be born as a result and many a <unk> will never hang in a butcher shop 
 but with inflation <unk> grain in the <unk> will still be a safer bet for the private farmer than money in the bank 
 once again the <unk> peasant holds poland 's future in his hands 
 until his labor can produce a profit in this dying and distorted system even solidarity 's sympathetic new government wo n't win him over 
 in coming months emergency food aid moving in from the west will be the one buffer between a <unk> public and a new political <unk> 
 factory workers on strike knocked poland 's communist bosses off balance last year this year it was the farmers who brought them down 
 in june farmers held onto meat milk and grain waiting for july 's usual <unk> price rises 
 the communists <unk> prices instead 
 the farmers ran a <unk> and meat disappeared from the shops 
 on aug. N the state <unk> up its controls and food prices leaped 
 without buffer stocks inflation exploded 
 that was when the <unk> old peasants ' party desperate to live through the crisis broke ranks with the communists and joined with solidarity in the east bloc 's first <unk> government 
 but by the time solidarity took office in september the damage was done 
 <unk> as economists have come to call it had gone <unk> 
 the cost of raising a <unk> kept <unk> ahead of the return for selling one 
 the farmers stayed angry 
 they still are 
 at <unk> on a cool day hundreds travel to the private market in <unk> a town not far from warsaw <unk> pigs cattle and <unk> of feed that the state 's official buyers ca n't induce them to sell 
 here they are searching for a higher price 
 in a crush of trucks and horse <unk> on the <unk> field <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> into the <unk> of a private butcher 's polish fiat 
 of course it 's better to sell private he says as the butcher <unk> away 
 why should anybody want to sell to them 
 the young farmer makes money on the few <unk> he sells here 
 he wo n't for long because his old state sources of <unk> and potatoes are <unk> up 
 there 's no feed he says 
 you ca n't buy anything <unk> 
 i do n't know why 
 edward <unk> does 
 his truck is <unk> across the field in a row of grain sellers 
 like the others it is loaded with <unk> wheat and <unk> in <unk> labeled asbestos made in <unk> 
 the farmer at the next truck <unk> wheat 
 it 's nice 
 it wo n't be cheaper 
 we sell direct 
 a heavy <unk> woman runs a handful through her fingers and counts him out a pile of <unk> 
 country people breed pigs says mr. <unk> <unk> against the back of his truck 
 they ca n't buy feed from the state 
 there is n't enough 
 some state middlemen come to buy from me 
 i sell a little 
 i am waiting 
 i have plenty more at home 
 on this morning he does n't sell much in <unk> either 
 at closing time farmers <unk> out most of what they <unk> in 
 a private market like this just is n't big enough to absorb all that business 
 the <unk> of <unk> it seems will not quickly <unk> away 
 state monopolies will keep on <unk> trade free prices or not until something else <unk> them 
 polish agriculture will need a whole private network of procurement processing and distribution plus a new manufacturing industry to supply it with <unk> pesticides <unk> and feed 
 the communists spent N years working to ensure that no such <unk> structures ever arose here 
 building them now will require <unk> from the west and removal of political <unk> a job that solidarity has barely started 
 but polish agriculture does <unk> one great asset already the private farmer 
 we are dealing with real entrepreneurs says <unk> <unk> an economist who advises rural solidarity the union 's <unk> <unk> 
 there are a lot of them and they have property 
 polish peasants <unk> the <unk> were once a source of shame to orthodox communists 
 now among communist reformers they are <unk> of envy 
 food is the <unk> 's top priority the key to popular support 
 as the chinese have shown and the soviets are learning family farms <unk> where <unk> fail 
 ownership it seems is the best fertilizer 
 the poles have had it all along 
 poland 's N million small private farms cover N N of its <unk> land 
 on it a quarter of the country 's N million people produce <unk> of its grain beef eggs and milk and <unk> of its fruit <unk> and potatoes 
 like the roman catholic church the polish peasant is a <unk> of the nation 
 try as they might the communists could neither replace nor break him 
 and they did try 
 a few miles past <unk> a <unk> road narrows to a track of sand and leads into <unk> a village of <unk> farms 
 <unk> <unk> owns N acres in N scattered <unk> 
 he grows <unk> and potatoes for a few <unk> five <unk> and N <unk> 
 in <unk> <unk> and torn shoes he stands in his <unk> <unk> the ground with a look both <unk> and <unk> 
 it 's bad soil he says 
 until N it was good soil 
 then the state put in a <unk> to supply the area with drinking water 
 farmers lay down before the <unk> 
 their protest was ignored 
 the dam caused the water level to drop in <unk> 
 <unk> <unk> <unk> and his <unk> <unk> 
 he expected as much 
 in his lifetime N years the communists brought electricity to his village and <unk> in drinking water from the <unk> 
 no phones 
 no gas 
 we wanted them to build a road here he says 
 they started and then abandoned it 
 a <unk> his only <unk> equipment stands in front of the <unk> 
 it 's russian 
 good for nothing 
 parts are a tragedy 
 even if i had a lot of money i could n't buy what i need 
 the farmer can say the same for coal cement saw <unk> 
 in poland only N N of all investment goes toward making things farmers want in the west it is closer to N N 
 the few big state farms take first crack at what does get made 
 they use N N more fertilizer per <unk> twice the high-grade feed 
 yet their best <unk> is that they produce N N of polish pork 
 i 've heard from friends that state farms are subsidized mr. <unk> says as his wife <unk> sets some chairs out in the sun 
 we have one near here 
 there is a lot of waste 
 a private farmer never <unk> anything 
 the state quit <unk> peasants onto its subsidized farms over N years ago 
 but it never did let up on the pressure 
 until recently a farmer with no heir had to will the state his land to collect his pension 
 the pension 's size still depends on how much produce he sells the state 
 his <unk> of materials also did until the state could n't hold up its end of that bargain 
 yet the state alone sells seeds and machines 
 when supplies are short it often hands them over only in exchange for milk or grain 
 a private farmer in poland is free to buy and sell land hire help decide what to grow and how to grow it 
 he is free to invest in <unk> and to fail for lack of chicken wire 
 he has plenty of freedom but no choices 
 i 'm on my own land mr. <unk> says 
 i do n't have to listen to what anybody tells me to do 
 sometimes says his wife we 're happy about that 
 by <unk> the peasant the communists have <unk> poland 
 <unk> like <unk> exist in a desert of poor schools and few doctors 
 farm income is N N below the average 
 the young leave especially <unk> who wo n't milk <unk> by hand 
 some men stay their best friend a bottle of <unk> but two million acres have gone <unk> 
 without machines good farms ca n't get bigger 
 so the potato crop once N million tons is down to N million 
 meat consumption is at N 's level pork production at N 's milk output at N 's 
 if a food crisis <unk> the communists a food revolution will make solidarity 
 the potential is displayed along every road into warsaw row upon row of <unk> stretching out behind modern <unk> that <unk> their owners ' wealth 
 <unk> are abundant and full of flavor in poland the <unk> and <unk> <unk> the state monopolies long broken 
 grain milk and meat come next 
 a private challenge to the <unk> <unk> industry will take more time and money than poland can spare although a <unk> or a local dairy can spring up fast 
 poland makes no machinery for a plant on that scale 
 solidarity wants it from the west 
 maria <unk> one of its farm experts <unk> it on the line the world bank will be brought in to help us destroy the old system 
 <unk> <unk> is destroying it now 
 he <unk> pork 
 a law went on the books in january that let him smoke <unk> without breeding pigs 
 he <unk> in 
 poland is short on enterprises not enterprise 
 i pay a lot to the farmer and five times the state salary to my employees he says 
 he is in warsaw to open a shop 
 i hire transportation and my customers have fresh cold cuts every day 
 i do n't subsidize anyone 
 everyone around me lives well 
 yes my prices are high 
 if nobody buys i bring my prices down 
 that 's the rule 
 that 's the market 
 mr. <unk> is making a fortune $ N a month he says 
 he has bought some trendy western clothes and a green mercedes with an american flag in the window 
 but the <unk> machines he picked up are N years old 
 i do n't want expensive machines 
 if the situation changes i 'll get stuck with them 
 that 's politics 
 by taking power in a deal with the peasant party 's <unk> communist <unk> solidarity has spooked the rural entrepreneur 
 rural solidarity <unk> to no <unk> when solidarity leader <unk> <unk> accepted the peasants ' support 
 it <unk> again in september when prime minister <unk> <unk> <unk> named a peasant party man as his agriculture minister 
 both the peasants and rural solidarity are forming new political parties for farmers 
 the peasants can make a credible case against solidarity that <unk> reform will drive millions from the land 
 next spring the two will battle in local elections 
 but until then and probably long afterward the communists ' <unk> of <unk> from the head of the dairy <unk> to the village bank manager will stay planted in the polish <unk> 
 we know how to get from capitalism to socialism <unk> <unk> is saying one afternoon 
 we do n't know how to get from socialism to capitalism 
 he farms N acres in <unk> two miles from the soviet border in one of poland 's poorest places 
 now he is mounting the steps of a <unk> building in a nearby village on a visit to the communist administrator the naczelnik 
 many people in poland hope this government will break down says mr. <unk> who belongs to the local council and to rural solidarity 
 that 's what the naczelnik counts on 
 he is our most dangerous enemy 
 every time he sees me he gets very nervous 
 the farmer <unk> into the naczelnik 's office 
 a thin man in a gray suit looks up from a newspaper 
 mr. <unk> sits 
 <unk> <unk> 's leg begins <unk> beneath his desk 
 solidarity does n't care for the good of this region he says after a few <unk> 
 they want to turn everything upside down in a week 
 mr. <unk> here wants N acres used at the moment by a state farm 
 he ca n't guarantee that he can use it any better 
 i am ready at any moment to compete with a state farm 
 the naczelnik <unk> his eyes 
 what have you got 
 not even a <unk> 
 and you want to make <unk> baskets too 
 i can do five things at once to be a businessman 
 big business mr. <unk> <unk> in english 
 the farmer stands to go 
 the naczelnik stands too 
 i care very much for this post he says 
 eight years i 've had it 
 a cultural center has been built shops 
 suddenly i am not a comfortable man for solidarity 
 i have accomplished too much 
 they want to do more 
 i wish them all the best 
 the farmer leaves 
 and the naczelnik <unk> his door 
 the house approved a short-term spending bill to keep the government operating through nov. N and provide $ N billion in emergency funds to assist in the recovery from hurricane hugo and the california earthquake 
 the N roll call vote reflected broad support for the disaster assistance but the cost to the treasury is sure to <unk> budget pressures this year and next under the gramm-rudman deficit reduction law 
 by a <unk> N margin the chamber rejected an effort to waive gramm-rudman for purposes of addressing the two disasters and budget analysts estimate the increased appropriations will widen the fiscal N deficit by at least $ N billion unless offsetting spending cuts or new revenues are found by congress 
 the budget impact will be greater still in fiscal N and the issue forced a confrontation between the appropriations committee leadership and budget committee chairman leon <unk> whose california district was at the center of the earthquake last week 
 going to the well of the chamber mr. <unk> demanded the costs be fully counted 
 his prominent role put him in the <unk> position of challenging the very committee members on whom his state will be most dependent in the months ahead 
 we do not come to this house asking for any <unk> said the california democrat 
 we do not intend to hide these costs from the american people 
 the $ N billion package <unk> $ N million for <unk> disaster loans $ N billion in highway construction funds and $ N billion divided between general emergency assistance and a reserve to be available to president bush to meet unanticipated costs from the two disasters 
 the funds are in addition to $ N billion appropriated last month to assist in the recovery from hugo bringing the total for the two disasters to nearly $ N billion in unanticipated spending 
 because of the <unk> of gramm-rudman the immediate impact is relatively small 
 but the appropriations set in motion spending that adds to an already grim budget picture for fiscal N 
 within the appropriations process the situation is even more difficult since the costs will be counted against the share of funds to be allocated to those <unk> that recently have had the greatest difficulty in staying within the budget 
 the underlying bill approved yesterday is required to keep the government operating past midnight tonight and this urgency has contributed to the speed and critics say mistakes that have accompanied the package of disaster assistance 
 the hastily drafted measure could hurt california by requiring it to put up more matching funds for emergency highway assistance than otherwise would be required 
 and the state 's delegation is fearful that the new funding will be counted against a separate $ N million in federal highway funds it would expect to receive under its normal allocation this year 
 also the high price of san francisco real estate puts the state at odds with federal regulations more <unk> to the national average 
 for example disaster loans which will go to small businesses and homeowners offer credit as low as N N in some cases 
 but the san francisco delegation finds itself asking that the cap per household be lifted to $ N from $ N to assist the hard hit but often wealthy marina district 
 the senate is expected to make some modifications today but both the white house and congress appear most anxious to speed final approval before tonight 's deadline 
 administration pressure <unk> any effort to add to total funding and the senate changes are expected to be largely technical dealing with highway aid and lifting the ceiling on total small business administration loans to $ N billion to accommodate the increased activity expected 
 yesterday 's floor action came as a house-senate conference approved a nearly $ N billion fiscal N military construction bill representing a N N reduction from last year and making severe cuts from pentagon requests for installations abroad 
 an estimated $ N million is allocated to continue work in <unk> 
 but all funding is cut for the philippines and projects in south korea are cut to $ N million or less than a sixth of the administration 's request 
 closer to home the negotiators were more generous 
 an estimated $ N million was set aside for military installations in the home state of north carolina rep. <unk> <unk> the house chairman 
 and $ N million would go to projects in tennessee represented by his senate counterpart and fellow democrat sen. james <unk> 
 texas and california are traditionally powerful within the conference but equally striking is the dominance of alaska pennsylvania and west virginia because of their power elsewhere in the appropriations process 
 senate appropriations committee chairman robert byrd d. <unk> even added report language listing $ N million in projects he wants in the budget next year 
 no individual illustrated this mix of power more yesterday than sen. daniel inouye d. hawaii who chairs the senate defense subcommittee 
 in the final trading the house was <unk> on setting aside $ N million to carry out base closings ordered to begin in fiscal N 
 but it gave ground to mr. inouye on a number of projects ranging from a $ N million parking garage here to a land transfer in hawaii to a provision to assist the <unk> indian tribe in washington state 
 the tribe is one of the poorest in the pacific northwest 
 mr. inouye who chairs the select committee on indian affairs used his power to move $ N from the air force to the bureau of indian affairs to assist in <unk> a <unk> base to accommodate a drug and alcohol rehabilitation center 
 meanwhile house-senate negotiators have tentatively agreed on a $ N billion anti-drug and <unk> <unk> cutting other federal spending N N to pay for it 
 a formal house-senate conference is expected to <unk> the accord later this week 
 mobil corp. is preparing to slash the size of its work force in the u.s. possibly as soon as next month say individuals familiar with the company 's strategy 
 the size of the cuts is n't known but they 'll be centered in the exploration and production division which is responsible for <unk> oil reserves drilling wells and pumping crude oil and natural gas 
 employees have n't yet been notified 
 sources said that meetings to discuss the staff reductions have been scheduled for friday at mobil offices in new orleans and denver 
 this would be a second round of cuts by mobil which along with other oil producers and refiners reduced its work force by N N to N N during the mid-1980s as part of an industrywide <unk> 
 mobil 's latest move could signal the beginning of further reductions by other oil companies in their domestic <unk> operations 
 in yesterday 's third-quarter earnings report the company <unk> to a $ N million provision for restructuring costs involving u.s. exploration and production operations 
 the report says that the restructuring will take place over a two-year period and will <unk> involve the transfer and termination of employees in our u.s. operations 
 a company spokesman reached at his home last night would only say that there will be a public announcement of the reduction program by the end of the week 
 most oil companies including mobil have been reporting lower third-quarter earnings largely as a result of lower earnings from chemicals as well as refining and marketing businesses 
 individuals familiar with mobil 's strategy say that mobil is reducing its u.s. work force because of declining u.s. output 
 yesterday mobil said domestic exploration and production operations had a $ N million loss in the third quarter while comparable foreign operations earned $ N million 
 industrywide oil production in this country fell by N barrels a day to N million barrels in the first eight months of this year 
 daily output is expected to decline by at least another N barrels next year 
 some mobil executives were <unk> that a reference to the cutbacks was included in the earnings report before workers were notified 
 one mobil executive said that the $ N million charge related to the action indicates a substantial number of people will be involved 
 some will likely be offered severance packages while others will be transferred to overseas operations 
 the justice department is in the process of trying to gain control over a law that federal judge david <unk> recently called a monster 
 <unk> to say he was talking about rico 
 with its recently revised guidelines for rico justice makes it clear that the law currently holds too many incentives for abuse by prosecutors 
 the text of the new policy guidelines from the criminal division are <unk> nearby 
 they strongly suggest that justice 's prosecutions of drexel burnham lambert michael <unk> and <unk> violated <unk> of fundamental fairness 
 justice is attempting to avoid a <unk> of these tactics 
 this amounts to an extraordinary <unk> of the tenure of new york mayoral candidate and former u.s. attorney rudolph giuliani who was more inclined to gathering <unk> than understanding markets 
 the new guidelines limit the pretrial <unk> of assets of <unk> defendants and their investors clients bankers and others 
 this follows earlier new guidelines from the tax division <unk> <unk> tax cases from <unk> as rico cases 
 the forfeiture memo cited considerable criticism in the press because of a perception that pre-trial <unk> of assets is <unk> to a seizure of property without due process 
 it told prosecutors not to seek <unk> if there are less <unk> alternatives such as bonds and in any case not to seek <unk> disproportionate to the defendant 's crime 
 these changes come a <unk> late for <unk> the first <unk> securities firm 
 it was forced into liquidation before trial when investors <unk> their funds after the government demanded a huge pre-trial asset forfeiture 
 <unk> investors including <unk> & co. and the harvard <unk> made the rational decision to withdraw their money for the firm the liquidation was sentence first verdict later 
 prosecutors wanted $ N million in forfeiture for alleged tax fraud of some $ N 
 the experience of <unk> and <unk> of other <unk> cases against legitimate businesses taught drexel that a <unk> investment bank would be an <unk> bank 
 drexel therefore agreed instead to an arrangement allowing it to plea to charges which the company is not in a position to dispute because of rico 
 part of drexel 's plea was to cut mr. <unk> loose 
 so after all the prosecutorial <unk> no one has established what if anything drexel did wrong 
 so two <unk> for the new rules 
 justice has finally recognized its employees ' abuses thanks largely to the demands for reform by former u.s. attorney in washington joseph <unk> who wants to salvage rico for real criminals 
 but prosecutorial guidelines are effective only if someone at justice is willing and able to <unk> <unk> prosecutors 
 judge <unk> of the appeals court in washington made this point at a <unk> institute conference last week in a remarkable speech titled rico the monster that <unk> <unk> 
 he said <unk> is supposed to be a government of laws not of men and yet rico defenders tell us that we should rely on prosecutorial discretion to protect against <unk> of rico 
 no prosecutorial guidelines observed or <unk> limit civil rico cases by plaintiffs for damages 
 what now for <unk> officials drexel and mr. <unk> 
 justice should review these cases to see what other prosecutorial abuses may have occurred 
 we suspect that justice will some day agree that only the complete repeal of rico can guarantee an end to <unk> in its name 
 the famous teddy z which cbs inc. had hoped would emerge as one of the few bright spots in its otherwise lackluster prime-time schedule is n't turning out to be the hit the network <unk> 
 although the half-hour situation comedy seen <unk> at N p.m eastern and pacific time is n't a candidate for cancellation it is slated for <unk> and by next week the network may announce teddy z is moving to N p.m. from its N time <unk> replacing the people next door which became the first network show to be canceled this season 
 teddy z which centers on a <unk> <unk> agent at a hollywood talent agency was scheduled in the <unk> N p.m. <unk> to follow murphy brown a situation comedy about a television news magazine <unk> <unk> <unk> 
 teddy z was boosted by favorable reviews and a <unk> promotional <unk> contest with k mart corp 
 it was <unk> on cable services including <unk> <unk> at night and <unk> and <unk> as the no. <unk> show for the week 
 but five weeks after the premiere the series has <unk> 
 in figures released yesterday by a.c. nielsen co teddy z produced by the television unit of columbia pictures entertainment inc. was in <unk> place 
 worse every week it <unk> audience <unk> from murphy brown and <unk> on cbs picks up again once teddy z is over and is followed by designing women 
 there is strong indication that teddy z is not compatible with the shows it is surrounding said john <unk> senior vice president at j. walter thompson co. a unit of wpp group plc 
 last week murphy brown was viewed by N N of the available television households while the number dropped to N N for teddy z and rose to N N for designing women 
 cbs executives said the program is also slated to <unk> some plot changes 
 <unk> <unk> wilson for example included the lead character 's <unk> family in the cast but that is not the right focus anymore said one cbs executive 
 instead cbs hopes the show will increasingly highlight the talent agency and the business of being an agent 
 we 're making adjustments on the show yes but nothing radical said craig nelson the story consultant on teddy z 
 but we hope to keep a balance between the office and the family 
 the opening credits are being <unk> mr. nelson said to make teddy 's situation clear to viewers who have not been with us since the beginning 
 those viewers find the show confusing 
 the stock market 's woes spooked currency traders but prompted a quiet little party among bond investors 
 prices of long-term treasury bonds moved <unk> to the stock market as investors sought safety amid growing evidence the economy is weakening 
 but the shaky economic outlook and the volatile stock market forced the dollar lower against major currencies 
 the bond market got an early boost from the <unk> sell-off in stocks 
 that rout was triggered by ual corp. 's announcement late monday that the proposed <unk> buy-out had collapsed 
 the <unk> decline in the dow jones industrial average during the morning trading session touched off a flight to safety that saw investors shifting assets from stocks to treasury bonds 
 at its strongest the treasury 's benchmark 30-year bond rose more than a point or more than $ N for each $ N face amount 
 as the stock market recovered some of its losses later in the day bond prices retreated 
 but analysts said the combination of a second consecutive decline in monthly <unk> orders and lackluster mid-october auto sales helped <unk> up the treasury market 
 a slowing economy and the implication of lower inflation and interest rates tend to bolster bond prices 
 on the surface the decline in september durable goods only N N did n't appear very weak 
 but orders for <unk> capital goods a <unk> of future plant and equipment spending were off N N after falling N N in august 
 auto makers reported that mid-october sales were running at an annual rate of about N million units far less than the N million units analysts had expected 
 taken together the <unk> and <unk> reports confirmed perceptions that the economy is <unk> down 
 although analysts do n't expect the federal reserve to ease credit policy soon reports like those yesterday help build the case for lower rates 
 now bond investors are looking toward next week 's report from national purchasing managers and the government 's october employment report as potentially prompting the fed to lower rates 
 the stock market 's <unk> drop frightened foreign investors who quickly bid the dollar lower 
 but as stock prices recovered some of the early losses so did the u.s. currency 
 although dealers said investors are becoming more bearish toward the dollar in the wake of the stock market 's recent troubles and as the u.s. economy <unk> the dollar ended down only modestly 
 in major market activity bond prices rose 
 the treasury 's benchmark 30-year bond gained nearly half a point or about $ N for each $ N face amount 
 the yield on the issue slipped to N N 
 the dollar retreated 
 in late new york trading the currency was quoted at N marks and N yen compared with N marks and N yen monday 
 <unk> of the rich and famous may be visiting some new <unk> in the near future 
 judge robert maximum bob <unk> sentenced jim bakker to N years in the big house yesterday while a beverly hills judge <unk> away <unk> <unk> <unk> for three days plus N hours of work with homeless women 
 miss <unk> <unk> her <unk> fear of <unk> <unk> 
 mr. bakker said he was guilty of <unk> but not fraud 
 we can only wonder who will be the next lost soul chosen to be america 's celebrity <unk> 
 boeing co. said trans european airways ordered a dozen N <unk> valued at a total of about $ N million 
 the N and N series aircraft will be <unk> by engines jointly produced by general electric co. and <unk> of france 
 currently boeing has a backlog of about $ N billion but production has been slowed by a strike of N machinists which entered its <unk> day today 
 last week a mediator failed to <unk> talks between the company and the <unk> who have rejected a pay raise offer of N N over three years 
 when the good <unk> assigned to <unk> <unk> over the <unk> of <unk> <unk> many years ago in <unk> she <unk> her with high e <unk> <unk> <unk> clean <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> as magic dust 
 maybe she could drop by at the metropolitan opera and bring along what she <unk> a little <unk> a few <unk> of <unk> skills and a nice <unk> 
 cast as violetta <unk> in a new production of <unk> 's la <unk> ms. <unk> last week did many things <unk> and others not so well 
 it is n't every day that we hear a violetta who can <unk> the first act 's <unk> music with all the little notes perfectly pitched and neatly <unk> together 
 never once did she <unk> for air or <unk> her <unk> 
 she was as cool as a <unk> 
 but as you may know things are not going well for violetta 
 there are times when she must show a little <unk> 
 she has <unk> after all and a <unk> <unk> and though a successful <unk> she is just about <unk> at the bank 
 worse her walls move all the time at least in this production 
 just when ms. <unk> sat down away from her guests to cough in private her salon began sliding around the stage her country <unk> also has a very active set of <unk> 
 hold on to those funny <unk> you wanted to caution her as the sets started to roll around once more 
 this is the most moving <unk> i 've ever seen 
 normally violetta can go about her business without wondering whether she is moving as <unk> as the <unk> 
 but this is a production designed and directed by franco <unk> and paid for by <unk> <unk> who has no need to count her pennies unlike violetta down to N louis at the opera 's end 
 seeing all those millions in action i was just so relieved that ms. <unk> <unk> thing that she is did n't <unk> <unk> herself in a <unk> 
 large and <unk> <unk> is another addition to the met 's growing stock of <unk> productions mostly by mr. <unk> 
 they have a life of their own and can be counted on to look good and perform whenever a cast is n't up to either 
 if a strike ever hits the met the company can still sell tickets to his <unk> and <unk> and boom out <unk> of another era 
 last week 's <unk> audience gave a bigger hand to a greenhouse than to the <unk> neil <unk> who sang an <unk> inside it 
 <unk> <unk> as a <unk> student <unk> around on <unk> mr. <unk> hardly seemed the fellow to catch a fancy <unk> 's eye 
 i wish he could wear <unk> in his voice 
 not nearly in his best form the <unk> made <unk> sounds along with his usual <unk> hand gestures 
 maybe mr. <unk> was too busy <unk> his set to work with his naturally <unk> <unk> 
 or is it that mr. <unk> is getting a little tired of <unk> 
 this is the same production already seen in paris and <unk> and its <unk> ideas echo the movie he made with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> 
 decades earlier maria <unk> sang the dallas staging that introduced the <unk> idea 
 in an <unk> that drives <unk> <unk> <unk> violetta lies dying in bed during the prelude rising <unk> when then she <unk> the great parties she used to throw 
 the entire opera is her dream 
 given the prelude 's <unk> connections with the music preceding the last act the idea is more <unk> than bad though as luck would have it for a change there actually was a <unk> in the pit whom we wanted to hear carlos <unk> trying to make <unk> music while we all waited for the bed <unk> to stir into song 
 once she did so the <unk> german <unk> with the shaky nerves who so often <unk> offered a <unk> flowing performance that in its <unk> and <unk> approach was totally at odds with the staging 
 of <unk> moments there were nearly none and whether this has to do with mr. <unk> or the wooden cast is hard to say 
 in any event ms. <unk> barely <unk> violetta 's <unk> in her long meeting with <unk> <unk> who as <unk> seemed fairly desperate trying to <unk> an <unk> <unk> into his heavy <unk> <unk> 
 di <unk> was n't much of an <unk> for <unk> southern france 
 perhaps mr. <unk> could let him substitute one of the <unk> about dead children and dark nights from <unk> 's <unk> 
 speaking of dark nights the met 's <unk> neighbor the new york city opera has canceled its season after failing to reach a settlement with its musicians who wanted pay parity with the the chicago <unk> and san francisco opera <unk> 
 well they can now go and <unk> there 
 good luck 
 common sense suggests that people who play for a company that charges about half what those houses do for a ticket are not in the same market

 <unk> <unk> used to hold the <unk> belief that it was more perfect to exist than not to exist and that to exist as a matter of necessity was most perfect of all 
 now only god exists as a matter of <unk> necessity it is built into his nature 
 but since the time of <unk> we humans could at least claim a sort of natural necessity for the existence of our <unk> 
 are n't we after all the inevitable culmination of that <unk> <unk> called evolution 
 if <unk> and natural selection slowly but surely give rise to more and more advanced forms of life then it was only a matter of <unk> before <unk> beings <unk> with reason <unk> and taste <unk> onto the scene 
 now along comes stephen jay gould to <unk> this <unk> illusion 
 his credentials are excellent for the task 
 star <unk> at harvard author of numerous popular books on science and <unk> of the <unk> lobby mr. gould is perhaps the world 's most <unk> <unk> <unk> 
 yet he puts quite a twist on the old story handed down from <unk> 
 for him natural history is anything but a gradual predictable march from <unk> <unk> to human <unk> it is a <unk> chaotic affair in which the emergence of a <unk> <unk> was a <unk> shot 
 in wonderful life the burgess <unk> and the nature of history norton N pages $ N mr. gould makes his case for the <unk> <unk> of human evolution 
 the argument turns on the discovery in N of an amazing fossil <unk> high in the canadian <unk> called the burgess <unk> 
 here in an area smaller than a city block lay buried <unk> of <unk> weird creatures that had <unk> more than N million years ago creatures whose <unk> variety far exceeded what can be found in all the world 's <unk> today 
 such an embarrassment of <unk> was <unk> to the man who discovered the burgess <unk> one charles <unk> <unk> 
 the received <unk> wisdom of the day said that animals living so long ago must be simple in design limited in scope and <unk> to contemporary <unk> 
 <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> hypothetical <unk> from the burgess <unk> in such a way that they could be <unk> into familiar categories 
 it was not until the early 1970s that cambridge prof. harry whittington and two sharp graduate students began to publish a <unk> of the burgess <unk> 
 by making <unk> <unk> about how the <unk> and distorted fossil remains <unk> to <unk> structures this <unk> was able to piece together a series of <unk> <unk> quite unlike anything currently on the planet 
 one was so <unk> in appearance it was dubbed <unk> 
 would that mr. gould 's minute <unk> of these creatures was always so <unk> 
 a good deal of the book is boring particularly the endless <unk> to high and pop culture and the frequent jokes <unk> the text 
 these turns do not provide sufficient relief from sentences like most modern <unk> have six <unk> <unk> on the <unk> 
 interest picks up though when mr. gould gets around to discussing the meaning of the burgess <unk> for the theory of evolution 
 not long after the appearance of life <unk> there was an explosive proliferation in the number of animal designs seen on the earth 
 the vast majority of them however were wiped out by a succession of environmental <unk> that were too sudden and catastrophic for the normal rules of natural selection to operate 
 consequently the <unk> process was like a <unk> in which each group held a ticket unrelated to its <unk> <unk> 
 so much for survival of the <unk> 
 so much too for the notion that we humans <unk> in the <unk> struggle by <unk> big brains 
 our <unk> <unk> <unk> out through the <unk> impact that did in the <unk> because they were small not smart 
 if anyone has difficulty <unk> a world in which history went <unk> on without us mr. gould <unk> several 
 in one birds are the dominant <unk> in another the <unk> <unk> with little <unk> 
 back when the burgess <unk> were <unk> it seems human <unk> hopes hung on the survival of a little worm with a <unk> called <unk> 
 mr. gould finds this oddly <unk> like an <unk> of old he views our <unk> as a source of both freedom and <unk> moral responsibility 
 i by contrast can not help feeling that if some other <unk> from the burgess <unk> had survived instead beings at once <unk> and less <unk> than <unk> <unk> might have eventually gained <unk> dominion 
 but even if no <unk> life had <unk> here at all the universe is a big place and given the right conditions sympathetic to creating some form of life 
 surely at some other <unk> address a <unk> <unk> would have risen out of the <unk> to explain why <unk> speaking it is indeed a wonderful life 
 mr. holt is a columnist for the literary review in london 
 the justice department scrambled to play down the significance of its new guidelines concerning prosecutions under the federal racketeering law 
 the guidelines were distributed to u.s. attorneys last summer but were disclosed for the first time by press reports this week 
 they discourage prosecutors under certain circumstances from seeking court orders <unk> the assets of racketeering defendants prior to trial 
 but david runkel chief justice department spokesman said the guidelines are a <unk> and a <unk> far more than a new direction 
 use of the <unk> influenced and corrupt organizations law against white-collar defendants as opposed to alleged <unk> figures has come under attack from some defense lawyers and legal scholars 
 critics have complained that the law unfairly strips defendants of assets before a jury <unk> they have committed a crime and that aggressive use of the forfeiture provisions can <unk> corporate defendants or force them into unfavorable plea bargains 
 in the new guidelines the justice department says that in attempting to freeze disputed assets before trial the government will not seek to disrupt the normal legitimate business activities of the defendant and will not seek to take from third parties assets <unk> transferred to them 
 the guidelines also state the government 's policy is not to seek the <unk> forfeiture permissible under the law where that forfeiture would be disproportionate to the defendant 's crime 
 another provision <unk> certain limits on when prosecutors may use <unk> charges as a basis for bringing a racketeering case 
 mr. runkel declined to speculate on whether the guidelines would curb racketeering prosecutions against corporate defendants 
 the impact if there is any will be impossible to judge ahead of time because the decision whether to use racketeering charges is made in individual cases by justice department officials in washington he said 
 in a memorandum describing the guidelines assistant attorney general edward dennis jr. said that government efforts to freeze defendants ' assets pending racketeering prosecutions have been the subject of considerable criticism in the press 
 but mr. runkel said the government is n't backing off on these kinds of matters at all 
 california legislators searching for ways to pay for the $ N billion to $ N billion in damages from last week 's earthquake are laying the <unk> for a temporary increase in the state 's sales tax 
 the talk of a sales tax rise follows a <unk> from congress on the question of how much the federal government is willing to spend to aid in california 's earthquake relief efforts 
 the state had sought as much as $ N billion in relief but yesterday the house approved a more general <unk> measure calling for $ N billion in aid the bulk of which would go to california with an unspecified amount going to regions affected by hurricane hugo 
 that leaves the state roughly $ N billion to $ N billion short 
 a sales tax increase appears to be the fastest and <unk> to raise funds in a hurry 
 according to the state department of finance a <unk> increase in the state 's <unk> per dollar sales tax could raise $ N billion 
 <unk> brown speaker of california 's assembly said that gov. george deukmejian has agreed to schedule a special session of the legislature within two weeks 
 california 's so-called <unk> limit effectively prevents the state from spending new tax money and so drastically limits its options in an emergency 
 both mr. brown the state 's most influential legislator and gov. deukmejian favor a temporary sales tax increase should more money be needed than the state can raise from existing sources and the federal government 
 according to a spokesman the governor is also studying the possibility of raising state gasoline taxes 
 mr. brown meanwhile believes only one tax will be <unk> and it will be a <unk> sales tax increase said chuck <unk> an aide 
 one immediate source of money is an emergency fund set up by gov. deukmejian 
 the fund has about $ N billion and is set up to handle precisely the kind of emergency the state faces said tom <unk> the governor 's deputy press secretary 
 but the fund 's size is disputed by mr. brown 's office which estimates the fund holds from $ N million to $ N million 
 moreover an aide to mr. brown said gov. deukmejian has expressed a desire not to spend all the reserve on this 
 to push through a sales tax increase however the state will have to suspend the <unk> limit citing an emergency 
 and then it will be required to lower taxes by a corresponding amount during a three-year period after the temporary tax increase ends said <unk> katz assistant director of the state department of finance 
 a sales tax increase would require two-thirds approval in both houses of the state 's legislature 
 but observers expect broad support 
 if there 's an emergency and there are n't sufficient funds from elsewhere i think the attitude will be supportive said kirk west president of the california chamber of commerce 
 but others think property owners ought to pay a higher portion of the state 's earthquake relief <unk> 
 since the late 1970s california property owners have benefited from a tax <unk> as a result of a state ballot initiative known as proposition N 
 the state could also increase gasoline taxes every one penny increase in the tax would yield $ N million a month 
 but gov. deukmejian and others are reluctant to do anything to harm the state 's chances of sharply raising gasoline taxes on a permanent basis 
 to raise more highway funds a measure to double the state 's <unk> a <unk> tax over five years is set to appear on the state 's june election ballot 
 but some fear imposing a temporary gasoline tax increase in the meantime could undercut support among voters for the measure 
 not everyone is convinced the state must raise new revenue to meet its earthquake needs 
 it 's possible though not probable that the state could get by with its existing resources and federal help said <unk> <unk> chairman of the state senate 's transportation committee 
 separately two men injured in last week 's <unk> freeway collapse in oakland began a legal battle against the state over whether officials adequately <unk> warnings about the structure 's safety 
 the claims which were filed with the state board of control but will probably end up in court are the first arising out of the collapse of the so-called cypress structure <unk> 
 the men can defeat <unk> that states often <unk> in court by showing that officials knew or should have known that design of the structure was defective and that they failed to make reasonable changes 
 a board of control spokesman said the board had not seen the claim and declined to comment

 people start their own businesses for many reasons 
 but a chance to fill out <unk> records is rarely one of them 
 red tape is the <unk> of small business 
 ironically the person who wants to run his or her own business is probably the active <unk> sort most likely to hate meeting the rules and <unk> demands of federal state and local regulators 
 yet every business owner has to face the <unk> of forms and regulations and often is the only one available to tackle it 
 there is hope of change 
 last week sen. malcolm <unk> r. <unk> held hearings on a bill to strengthen an existing law designed to reduce regulatory <unk> for small businesses 
 a great many federal regulations are meant for larger entities and do n't really apply to small businesses says <unk> jacob a legislative aide to sen. <unk> 
 other lawmakers are busy trying to revive the recently <unk> <unk> reduction act which many feel benefited small enterprises 
 thus optimistic entrepreneurs await a promised land of less red tape just as soon as uncle sam gets around to arranging it 
 meanwhile they tackle the <unk> of paper and <unk> about a dream world where <unk> postal regulations and government inspectors are <unk> 
 to find out what red tape <unk> entrepreneurs most the journal asked a completely <unk> random sample of business owners to <unk> about the forms and regulations they would most like to get lost in the mail 
 some entrepreneurs say the red tape they most love to hate is red tape they would also hate to lose 
 they concede that much of the government <unk> that <unk> them is essential to the public good and even to their own businesses 
 rules that set standards for products or govern business behavior generally the best regarded form of red tape create a level playing field and keep unscrupulous competitors away says <unk> west president of <unk> international inc. a <unk> va. business that designs <unk> and other products 
 mr. west cites the federal communications commission and its standards for telecommunications equipment they monitor product quality and prevent junk from flooding the market 
 some <unk> about red tape are predictable architects complain about a host of building regulations auto leasing companies about car insurance rules 
 determining when handicapped access is required can be a nightmare for architects says mark <unk> president of <unk> & co. a <unk> mass. architectural firm 
 there is such a <unk> of federal state and local codes that building inspectors are backing away from <unk> them mr. <unk> says 
 taxi leasing and other companies that maintain fleets of vehicles devote substantial resources to <unk> with state insurance laws and a host of agencies 
 it 's very costly and <unk> says phil rosen a partner in fleet & leasing management inc. a boston <unk> company 
 one senior executive at his firm spends nearly N N of his time on insurance he says 
 other forms of red tape are more pervasive 
 the most onerous many entrepreneurs say is the <unk> and filing required by tax authorities 
 <unk> with environmental and workplace regulations runs a close second 
 but <unk> run the <unk> 
 here is the red tape that <unk> surveyed business owners the most 
 environmental regulations 
 next to medical insurance costs of compliance are the fastest-growing expense at <unk> inc. a <unk> r.i. chemical company 
 peter <unk> the company 's owner says spending on regulatory paper work and the people to do it mostly to comply with federal state and local environmental laws will rise almost N N this year to $ N 
 mr. <unk> adds that spending on environmental red tape amounts to between N N and N N of <unk> 's total operating expenses 
 eastern <unk> corp. a <unk> mass. maker of thin metal precision parts must report to five federal and state agencies as well as to local fire police hospital and plumbing authorities says robert <unk> president 
 one state environmental regulator returned a report because it was n't heavy enough it could n't have been correct mr. <unk> says 
 <unk> rules 
 employers must deposit <unk> taxes exceeding $ N within three days after payroll or pay stiff penalties and that 's a big problem for small businesses 
 it 's especially <unk> if you 're on the road and you 're the one responsible says eddie brown president of brown capital management inc. a baltimore <unk> firm 
 employee <unk> 
 <unk> employee <unk> on <unk> health care and other subjects costs over $ N a year for <unk> <unk> president of professional agricultural management inc. a <unk> calif. provider of business services to farmers 
 an employer leaves itself open to a great deal of liability if its employee <unk> do n't reflect the most recent laws he says 
 but the <unk> laws are usually so complicated and confusing that you need professionals to help you you ca n't do it yourself he adds 
 pension and <unk> rules 
 <unk> with these is enough to make business owners look forward to their own pension days 
 yearly changes in federal benefit laws force small businesses to repeatedly <unk> and <unk> existing plans 
 alice <unk> who runs her own public-relations concern in new york says she has had to overhaul her pension and <unk> plans three times in the past three years 
 it does n't increase benefits but it 's costly and <unk> ms. <unk> says 
 compliance added N N to N N to her accounting bill last year she says 
 sales tax records 
 advertising agencies and other service companies are exempt from city and state sales tax in most <unk> but the exemption comes at a price of <unk> records and <unk> reviews 
 to justify their exempt status and avoid penalties these businesses must show once a year that each and every transaction on which they did n't pay sales tax was a legitimate business expense 
 you need one person to just take care of sales tax says <unk> <unk> executive vice president of lee <unk> & <unk> advertising inc. new york 
 when the trinity <unk> theater named anne bogart its artistic director last spring the nation 's theatrical <unk> <unk> a collective <unk> 
 ms. bogart an <unk> <unk> of <unk> dramatic <unk> that <unk> into such <unk> <unk> as <unk> and <unk> 's south pacific is <unk> downtown 
 trinity rep meanwhile is one of the nation 's oldest and most respected regional theaters still <unk> an annual a christmas carol 
 how would this <unk> of traditional values fare in ms. bogart 's <unk> hands 
 she held her fire with her first production at the trinity earlier this season 
 it was a predictable revival of her <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> 's theoretical <unk> called no plays no <unk> 
 now with the opening of <unk> gorky 's <unk> <unk> ms. bogart has laid her cards on the table 
 <unk> is a hand that will test the <unk> of her audiences 
 for ms. bogart who initially studied and directed in germany and cites such european directors as peter stein giorgio <unk> and <unk> <unk> as influences tends to stage her productions with a <unk> <unk> whether the text demands it or not 
 and gorky considered the father of soviet socialist <unk> did not write plays that easily lend themselves to deliberately <unk> <unk> techniques 
 gorky was a loyal if occasionally <unk> <unk> writer committed to <unk> the <unk> with plain speaking rooted in a slightly sour version of <unk> <unk> 
 and <unk> <unk> in N as a kind of <unk> to <unk> 's cherry <unk> is a lawn party of russian <unk> engaged in an <unk> ideological fight to the finish between the <unk> and the reformers 
 along the way there also are lots of romantic <unk> 
 <unk> ms. bogart has kept gorky 's time and place intact 
 despite the absence of <unk> and a tendency to turn the furniture upside down the production is rich in russian <unk> voiced by <unk> folk sporting <unk> <unk> and <unk> cotton with <unk> and fishing poles <unk> 
 but beyond this <unk> <unk> to tradition ms. bogart and company head off in a <unk> direction that all but <unk> gorky 's <unk> drama into something <unk> to well <unk> 
 the director 's attempt to force some <unk> distance between her actors and their characters frequently <unk> with performances that are <unk> <unk> 
 not only do the actors stand outside their characters and make it clear they are at odds with them but they often literally stand on their heads 
 like peter <unk> ms. bogart <unk> her actors as if they were <unk> <unk> <unk> them on <unk> <unk> them off tables even hanging them from <unk> while having them perform some <unk> <unk> of <unk> 
 there are moments in this <unk> when the characters <unk> the vast <unk> country house which looks like a <unk> of frank lloyd wright and is designed by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> in 
 talk <unk> from where it <unk> one of them says 
 the clash of <unk> <unk> this treatment but the <unk> and <unk> of gorky 's individual characters have <unk> in the <unk> 
 as for the humor that gorky 's text provides when <unk> in such broad strokes particularly by the lesser members of the <unk> it looks and sounds forced 
 ms. bogart does better with music than with words when she wants as she so often does want to express herself through gorky 's <unk> play 
 here she has the aid of her longtime associate jeff <unk> whom she appointed trinity 's <unk> musical director and whom she equipped with a <unk> new $ N sound system and recording studio 
 for gorky mr. <unk> provided an <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> which is less a score than a separate character with a distinct point of view 
 like <unk> and indeed <unk> pound ms. bogart has said that her intent in such <unk> staging of the <unk> is simply an attempt to make it new 
 indeed during a recent <unk> audience discussion the director explained that her <unk> artistic wish was to find a way to play somewhere over the rainbow so that the song 's original beauty comes through <unk> the <unk> 
 the danger that ms. bogart seems to be <unk> here is one of <unk> rather than <unk> a vision so at odds with the playwright 's that the two points of view <unk> rather than <unk> each other 
 ms. bogart 's cast is part and parcel of the problem 
 ed shea and barbara <unk> never find a real reason for their love affair as the <unk> <unk> young <unk> and the <unk> humanitarian doctor maria <unk> 
 cynthia <unk> as the <unk> <unk> is a <unk> <unk> not the <unk> <unk> gorky intended 
 better to look in the corners for performances that <unk> or <unk> 
 <unk> <unk> in addition to <unk> one of the evening 's more impressive <unk> instruments brings an <unk> <unk> touch to her role of <unk> everybody 's favorite mom 
 <unk> rice plays the <unk> with so much edge as to steal her two scenes 
 but it is the trinity rep <unk> jonathan fried <unk> the <unk> who is the actor to watch whether he is <unk> it up while conducting the chamber musicians or <unk> his neighbor 's wife <unk> <unk> by <unk> her <unk> 
 ms. de <unk> writes frequently about theater

 morgan stanley the once <unk> investment house in N helped a corporate client complete a hostile takeover 
 it was the start of a boom in unfriendly even <unk> mergers 
 on july N N international <unk> of canada advised by morgan offered $ N a share equal to $ N million for esb a philadelphia battery maker 
 esb said it was given only a <unk> advance warning on a take it or leave it basis from inco as the toronto company is called 
 esb is aware that a hostile tender offer is being made by a foreign company for all of esb 's shares said <unk> port esb 's president

 on a single day inco lifted its offer to $ N and then to $ N equal to $ N million 
 united met the $ N but then withdrew 
 esb on july N accepted the inco offer and the brief battle unlike the <unk> and lengthy big takeovers of N was over 
 the new <unk> game became a money maker for wall street 's once <unk> <unk> houses 
 inco paid morgan an advisory fee of about $ N a <unk> figure by today 's measures

 homefed corp. said third-quarter net income slid N N to $ N million or $ N per fully diluted share from $ N million or $ N a fully diluted share because of increased bad assets and unexpected trouble in unloading foreclosed property 
 the decline surprised analysts and jolted homefed 's stock which lost N N of its value closing at $ N on the new york stock exchange down $ N 
 homefed had been one of the handful of large west coast thrifts that in recent quarters had <unk> interest-rate problems <unk> the industry by keeping a lid on problem assets and lending heavily into the <unk> california housing market 
 analysts had been projecting fully diluted earnings in the third quarter in the range of about $ N a share 
 however homefed 's loan <unk> and purchases plunged N N in the quarter to $ N billion from $ N billion a year earlier 
 meanwhile <unk> assets rose to $ N million from $ N million 
 some $ N million of the troubled assets is <unk> real estate a N N surge from the $ N million of <unk> property homefed held a year ago 
 homefed has $ N billion of assets 
 homefed said most of the troubled assets are apartment <unk> shopping <unk> and other commercial real estate 
 it said about half are in california with the rest scattered across the country 
 it said sales of such properties were slower than anticipated in the third quarter but it expects sales to pick up in the rest of the year 
 homefed said the slide in loan <unk> was more a matter of design than a sign of cooling in the california market 
 any such downturn in california would be grim news for west coast thrifts particularly the less healthy ones which have performed poorly even with a <unk> market 
 but homefed said it <unk> <unk> loan <unk> in the quarter because of uncertainty over the new capital requirements and regulations that will emerge from negotiations over <unk> the government 's massive thrift bailout bill 
 it said its real-estate operations earned a record $ N million more than double year-earlier real estate profit of $ N million 
 and analysts said they see no signs of an imminent <unk> in california real estate even with last week 's earthquake 
 the thrift said earnings also were <unk> in the quarter by a $ N million provision for losses associated with its previously reported plan to liquidate a real-estate franchise network 
 for the nine months homefed earned $ N million or $ N a fully diluted share a N N increase from year-earlier net income of $ N million or $ N a fully diluted share 
 yields on certificates of deposit at major banks were little changed in the latest week 
 the average yield on six-month cds of $ N and less slipped to N N from N N according to banxquote money markets an information service based here 
 on one-year cds of $ N and less the average slid to N N from N N 
 both issues are among the most popular with individual investors 
 because of <unk> in the economy rates can be expected to decline over a one-year horizon said <unk> mehl chairman of banxquote 
 it 's unclear how much rates can fall and how soon 
 changes in cd yields in the week ended tuesday were in line with <unk> up and down within a fairly narrow range for the last two months 
 interest rates generally began declining last spring after moving steadily upward for more than a year 
 the average yield on <unk> three-month cds moved up <unk> of a percentage point in the latest week to N N 
 long-term cds declined just a fraction 
 the average yield on both two-year cds and five-year cds was N N 
 only cds sold by major brokerage firms posted significant increases in average yields in the latest week reflecting increased yields on treasury bills sold at monday 's auction 
 the average yield on six-month <unk> cds rose to N N from N N and on one-year cds the average yield rose to N N from N N 
 the brokerage firms which negotiate rates with the banks and thrifts whose cds they sell generally feel they have to offer clients more than they can get on <unk> or from banks and thrifts directly 
 <unk> sold at monday 's auction yielded N N for six months and N N for three months up from N N and N N respectively the week before 
 so-called jumbo cds typically in denominations of $ N and up also usually follow <unk> and interest rate trends in general more than those aimed at small investors 
 some <unk> posted <unk> changes in average yields this week both up and down 
 the average yield on <unk> <unk> rose to N N from N N while the two-year average fell by the same amount to N N 
 six-month and <unk> yields were unchanged on average 
 the cd market is unsettled right now said banxquote 's mr. mehl 
 it 's very easily influenced by changes in the stock market and the junk bond market 
 the small changes in averages reflect generally unchanged yields at many major banks 
 some however lowered yields significantly 
 at chase manhattan bank in new york for example the yield on a small <unk> six-month cd fell about a quarter of a percentage point to N N 
 in california bank of america dropped the yield on both six-month and one-year savings cds to N N from N N 
 yields on money-market deposits were unchanged at an average N N for $ N and less and down just a <unk> of a percentage point to N N for jumbo deposits

 benjamin jacobson & sons has been the new york stock exchange specialist firm in charge of trading stock in ual corp. and its <unk> since the early 1930s 
 but the firm has never had a day like yesterday 
 at first ual did n't open because of an order <unk> 
 when it did a half-hour into the session it was priced at $ N a share down more than $ N from monday 's close 
 it sank further to as low as $ N but a big rally developed in the last half hour pushing the stock back up to close at $ N down just $ N from monday 
 in the process N million shares traded making ual the second most active issue on the big board 
 <unk> pizza when they could and <unk> until their voices gave out the two benjamin jacobson specialists at the big board 's ual trading post yesterday <unk> over what can only be described as a financial <unk> 
 it was chaotic 
 but we like to call it controlled chaos said <unk> robert j. jacobson jr. <unk> of the firm 's founder 
 he <unk> the ual post yesterday with christopher bates N an energetic long <unk> who 's a dead ringer for actor <unk> <unk> 
 who was doing all the selling 
 options traders arbitrage traders everyone said mr. bates cooling down with a <unk> of apple <unk> after the close yesterday 
 added mr. jacobson there were some pretty bad losses in the stock 
 big board traders said a <unk> buy order at $ N a share entered by bear stearns & co. which was active in ual stock all day is what set off the ual crowd in the late afternoon 
 a subsequent rally in ual helped the staggering stock market stage an <unk> recovery from an <unk> deficit to finish only slightly below monday 's close 
 both jacobson traders who had been hoping ual trading would get back to normal read the news about the <unk> of ual takeover plans on the train into work yesterday morning 
 the news told them it would be a while longer before ual resumed trading like a regular airline stock after months of gyrations 
 when mr. jacobson walked into the office at N a.m. edt he announced ok buckle up 
 messrs. jacobson and bates walked on the big board floor at about N a.m. yesterday and immediately spotted trouble 
 already entered in the big board 's computers and <unk> to their post were sell orders for N ual shares 
 the ual news had already caused a selling furor in the so-called third market in which firms buy and sell stock away from the exchange floor 
 ual which closed on the big board monday at $ N a share traded in the third market afterward as low as $ N a share 
 there were rumors of $ <unk> trades 
 in the N minutes before the N opening bell the jacobson specialists kept getting sell orders heavier than they <unk> 
 and at N they posted a $ N to $ N first indication or the price range in which the stock would probably open 
 that range was quickly narrowed to $ N to $ N although traders surrounding the post were told that $ N to $ N would be the likely target 
 when ual finally opened a half hour late some N shares traded at $ N 
 there was selling pressure from everyone said one trader 
 this month 's friday-the-13th market plunge spurred by ual news was n't as bad for the jacobson specialists as yesterday 's action 
 on that earlier day the stock 's trading was halted at a critical time so the specialists could catch their breath 
 not yesterday 
 mr. jacobson his gray hair flying did n't wear out his <unk> <unk> but he sweat so much he considered sending out for a new <unk> 
 mr. bates usually handles day-to-day ual trading on his own 
 but yesterday the heavy trading action eventually consumed not only messrs. jacobson and bates but four other jacobson partners all doing their <unk> job of <unk> buyers and sellers together and adjusting prices to accommodate the market 
 about N floor traders <unk> near the ual post most of the day and probably hundreds more came and went a <unk> mass as one trader described it 
 the N <unk> volume flowing through the jacobson specialist operation was about five times normal for the stock 
 the heavy buying in the last half hour led the specialists to take special steps 
 the bear stearns order that marked the <unk> turnaround caused a massive buying effort as ual jumped $ N a share to $ N in the last half hour said mr. bates 
 with N seconds of trading to go mr. jacobson with what voice he had left announced to the trading <unk> we 're going to trade one price on the bell 
 that meant no trading would occur in the final seconds as a way of making sure that <unk> orders are n't <unk> to a sudden price swing that would upset customers 
 about N shares sold at $ N on the bell representing about eight to N late orders the specialists estimate 
 big board traders praised the jacobson specialists for getting through yesterday without a trading halt 
 in chicago a ual spokesman by way of policy declined to comment on the company 's stock or the specialists ' performance 
 leaving the exchange at about N p.m. the jacobson specialists made no predictions about how trading might go today 
 said <unk> ellis a jacobson partner who got involved in the ual action it all starts all over again today 
 britain 's current account deficit dropped to # N billion $ N billion in september from an adjusted # billion $ N billion the previous month but the improvement comes amid increasing concern that a recession could strike the u.k. economy next year 
 the confederation of british industry 's latest survey shows that business executives expect a <unk> slowdown largely because of a <unk> series of interest-rate increases that has raised banks ' base lending rates to N N 
 the outlook has deteriorated since the summer with orders and employment falling and output at a standstill said david <unk> chairman of the industry group 's economic committee 
 he also said investment by businesses is falling off 
 of N companies surveyed N N expect to cut spending on plant equipment and machinery while only N N plan to spend more 
 but despite mounting recession fears government data do n't yet show the economy <unk> to a halt 
 unemployment for example has continued to decline and the september trade figures showed increases in both imports and exports 
 as a result prime minister margaret thatcher 's government is n't currently expected to ease interest rates before next spring if then 
 chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson views the high rates as his chief weapon against inflation which was <unk> by tax cuts and loose credit policies in N and N 
 officials fear that any <unk> this year could <unk> inflation or further weaken the pound against other major currencies 
 <unk> off attacks on his economic policies in a house of commons debate yesterday mr. lawson said inflation remains the greatest threat to our economic <unk> and promised to take whatever steps are needed to <unk> it off 
 the latest government figures said retail prices in september were up N N from a year earlier 
 many economists have started predicting a mild recession next year 
 david owen u.k. economist with kleinwort benson group reduced his growth forecast for N to N N from N N and termed the risk of recession next year quite high 
 but he said the downturn probably wo n't become a major <unk> similar to those of N and N 
 still britain 's current slump is a cause for concern here as the nation joins in the european community 's plan to create a unified market by N 
 compared with the major economies on the continent the u.k. faces both higher inflation and lower growth in the next several months 
 as a result mr. owen warned investment will be more likely to flow toward the other european economies and the u.k. will be less prepared for the single market 
 britain 's latest trade figures contained some positive news for the economy such as a surge in the volume of exports which were N N higher than a year earlier 
 but while september exports rose to # N billion imports shot up to # N billion 
 the resulting # N billion merchandise trade deficit was partly offset by an assumed surplus of # N million in so-called <unk> items which include income from investments services and official transfers 
 despite the narrowing of the monthly trade gap economists expect the current account deficit for all of N to swell to about # N billion from # N billion in N 
 increasingly economists say the big deficit reflects the slipping competitive position of british industry 
 when the country gets <unk> we tend to buy high-quality imports mr. owen said 
 vickers plc a british aerospace defense and automotive conglomerate said it reached an agreed cash bid of # N million $ N million for ross <unk> group plc a maker of specialty <unk> and <unk> 
 the company said it expects to receive acceptances for its offer of N pence $ N per share representing at least N N of ross <unk> 's issued share capital or N million ordinary shares 
 vickers said its offer also includes an option to receive a <unk> loan note in <unk> of cash 
 the notes can be redeemed starting in july N 
 the company said its acquisition of ross <unk> will be covered largely by cash raised in its july disposal of <unk> for # N million

 a group of investors recently bought the remaining assets of <unk> hoping to rebuild it 
 other investors have lost millions in partnerships that bought thoroughbred <unk> or <unk> breeding rights 
 one big problem has been the thoroughbred <unk> market 
 from N to N prices for the best <unk> at the summer sales rose N N to an average of $ N

 you can see the highs and lows of the business all under one <unk> she tells the group 
 there are n't too many winners 
 perhaps the biggest hurdle owners face is convincing newcomers that this is a reputable business 
 some badly managed partnerships have burned investors sometimes after they received advice from industry consultants 
 so owners have developed a code of ethics <unk> rules for consultants and agents and disclosure of fees and any conflicts of interest 
 but some are skeptical of the code 's effectiveness 
 the industry is based on individual honesty says cap <unk> a lexington horse farmer and one of the investors who bought <unk> 
 despite the drop in prices for <unk> owning one still is n't cheap 
 at the low end investors can spend $ N or more to own a <unk> in partnership with others 
 at a <unk> sale a buyer can go solo and get a horse for a few thousand dollars 
 but that means paying the horse 's maintenance on average it costs $ N a year to raise a horse

 general electric co. executives and lawyers provided misleading and false information to the pentagon in N in an effort to cover up longstanding fraudulent billing practices federal prosecutors alleged in legal briefs 
 the government 's startling allegations filed only days before the scheduled start of a criminal <unk> trial against ge in philadelphia federal district court challenge the <unk> and <unk> of the nation 's third-largest defense contractor 
 in a strongly <unk> response <unk> a filing made in the same court yesterday ge asserted that prosecutors have misstated the testimony of witnesses distorted documents and ignored important facts 
 the company attacked the government 's allegations as reckless and <unk> <unk> and said its management promptly and accurately reported to the pentagon all relevant information about billing practices 
 the case strikes at the corporate image of ge which provides the military with everything from jet engines and electronic <unk> equipment to highly classified design work on the strategic defense initiative and could cause a loss of future defense contracts if pentagon and justice department officials take a tough stance 
 the company has been considered an industry leader in <unk> cooperation and voluntary disclosures of improper or inflated billing practices 
 but the government now claims that a group of company managers and lawyers engaged in an elaborate strategy over five years to <unk> from federal authorities the extent and details of widespread fraudulent billing practices 
 the problems were uncovered during a series of internal investigations of the company 's space systems division which has been the focus of two separate <unk> prosecutions by the government since N 
 the dispute stems from pretrial <unk> in the pending court case in which prosecutors have been demanding access to a host of internal company <unk> reports and documents 
 last november a federal grand jury indicted ge on charges of fraud and false claims in connection with an alleged scheme to <unk> the army of $ N million on a <unk> computer contract 
 the company for its part maintains that many of the disputed documents are <unk> <unk> communications that should n't be turned over to prosecutors 
 a hearing is scheduled on the issue today 
 the government 's <unk> filing covers events leading up to the current case and an earlier indictment in march N when ge was accused of <unk> the pentagon by illegally claiming cost overruns on <unk> missile contracts 
 ge pleaded guilty and paid a fine of more than $ N million in the <unk> case which involved some of the same individuals and operations that are at the center of the dispute in the philadelphia court 
 in order to show that all of its units had corrected billing problems and therefore should become eligible again for new contracts prosecutors contend that <unk> ge executives and company lawyers provided misleading statements to <unk> force secretary <unk> <unk> and other pentagon officials during a series of meetings in N 
 overall the government contends that ge 's disclosure efforts largely were intended to curry favor with pentagon officials without detailing the extent of the management <unk> and allegedly pervasive billing <unk> uncovered by company investigations 
 prosecutors <unk> a company that allegedly sat on damaging evidence of <unk> from N to N despite warnings from an internal <unk> 
 when ge finally disclosed the problems prosecutors contend that mr. <unk> was <unk> informed that the suspected practices had only just been discovered by ge management 
 in its brief the government asserted that it needs the internal ge documents to <unk> anticipated efforts by ge during the trial to demonstrate its good corporate character 
 ge which was surprised by the last-minute subpoena for more than N boxes and file <unk> of documents <unk> that senior ge managers did n't find out about questionable billing practices until N and that the information was passed on quickly to mr. <unk> at his first meeting with company representatives 
 subsequent meetings initiated after the company and two of its units were briefly suspended from federal contracts were held to <unk> mr. <unk> with the company 's <unk> procedures and to disclose additional information according to ge 
 ge 's filing contends that the billing practices at the heart of the current controversy involved technical disputes rather than criminal activity 
 the company 's conduct does not even raise a question of <unk> corporate intent <unk> or <unk> ge 's brief asserts 
 on the contrary it shows a corporation reacting swiftly and aggressively to very difficult issues in largely <unk> waters

 savings and loans reject blacks for mortgage loans twice as often as they reject whites the office of thrift supervision said 
 but that does n't necessarily mean thrifts are <unk> against blacks the agency said 
 the office an arm of the treasury said it does n't have data on the financial position of applicants and thus ca n't determine why blacks are rejected more often 
 nevertheless on capitol hill where the information was released yesterday at a senate banking subcommittee hearing lawmakers said they are worried that financial institutions are routinely <unk> against minorities 
 they asked regulators to suggest new ways to force banks and thrifts to comply with <unk> laws 
 sen. alan <unk> d ill. chairman of the subcommittee on consumer and regulatory affairs said i 'm not a <unk> 
 but when blacks are getting their loan applications rejected twice as often as whites and in some cities it is three and four times as often i conclude that discrimination is part of the problem 
 james <unk> a spokesman for the u.s. league of savings institutions said the data is a red flag but lacking the financial data you ca n't make a case that discrimination is widespread 
 the trade group official added certainly the federal government should take a hard look at it 
 sen. <unk> held the hearing to follow up on a provision in the savings and loan bailout bill that required regulators to report on evidence of <unk> in mortgage lending 
 the legislation also requires broad new disclosures of the race sex and income level of borrowers but that information wo n't be gathered in new studies for several months at least 
 the federal reserve said its studies in recent years which adjust for income differences and other <unk> showed that blacks received fewer home mortgages from banks and thrifts than whites 
 but john <unk> a fed governor told the subcommittee the evidence is mixed and that the fed 's believes the vast majority of banks are n't <unk> 
 for instance he noted the fed studies have shown that blacks receive more home improvement loans than whites 
 several lawmakers were angered that the bank and thrift regulators generally said they have been too busy handling the record number of bank and thrift failures in the past few years to put much energy into investigating possible discrimination 
 we would be the first to admit that we have not devoted the necessary amount of emphasis over the past several years to developing <unk> for discrimination said jonathan <unk> a top official of the office of thrift supervision 
 if we 've got folks out there who are being turned away in the mortgage market improperly and unfairly said sen. donald <unk> d. mich. chairman of the banking committee then that is a matter that needs remedy now not six months from now or six years from now or N years from now

 thrift regulators did n't give any figures on their enforcement actions

 time warner inc. is considering a legal challenge to tele-communications inc. 's plan to buy half of showtime networks inc. a move that could lead to <unk> war between the cable industry 's two most powerful players 
 time is also fighting the transaction on other fronts by attempting to discourage other cable operators from joining tele-communications as investors in showtime cable-tv industry executives say 
 time officials declined to comment 
 last week tele-communications agreed to pay viacom inc. $ N million for a N N stake in its showtime subsidiary which is a distant second to time 's home box office in the delivery of <unk> networks to cable subscribers 
 tele-communications the u.s. 's largest cable company said it may seek other cable partners to join in its investment 
 tele-communications is hbo 's largest customer and the two have a number of other business relationships 
 earlier this year time even discussed bringing tele-communications in as an investor in hbo executives at both companies said 
 the purchase of the showtime stake is a direct <unk> in our face said one senior time executive 
 time is expected to mount a legal challenge in u.s. district court in new york where viacom in may filed a $ N billion antitrust suit charging time and hbo with <unk> the <unk> business and trying to crush competition from showtime 
 executives involved in <unk> time 's defense say it is now preparing a <unk> naming both viacom and tele-communications as defendants 
 the executives say time may seek to break up the transaction after it is <unk> or may seek constraints that would prevent tele-communications from dropping hbo in any of its cable systems in favor of showtime 
 viacom officials declined to comment 
 jerome <unk> tele-communications ' chief outside counsel said he was n't aware of time 's legal plans 
 but he said that any effort by time to <unk> the tele-communications investment in showtime as <unk> would be the pot calling the <unk> black 
 it 's hard to see how an investment by the largest cable operator in the weaker of the two networks is <unk> when the stronger of the two networks is owned by the second largest cable operator mr. <unk> said 
 in addition to owning hbo with N million subscribers time warner separately operates cable-tv system serving about N million cable-tv subscribers 
 tele-communications controls close to N million cable subscribers and viacom has about one million 
 in its suit against time viacom says the ownership of both cable systems and <unk> networks gives the company too much market power 
 time argues that in joining up with tele-communications viacom has potentially more power particularly since viacom also owns cable networks <unk> <unk> and <unk> at <unk> 
 ironically tele-communications and time have often worked closely in the cable business 
 together they control nearly N N of turner broadcasting systems inc. tele-communications has a N N stake while time warner has a N N stake 
 but since time 's merger with warner communications inc. relations between the two have become <unk> 
 each company worries that the other is becoming too powerful and too <unk> integrated 
 meanwhile some legal observers say the tele-communications investment and other developments are weakening viacom 's antitrust suit against time 
 viacom <unk> time in its suit of refusing to carry showtime or a sister service the movie channel on time 's manhattan cable tv system one of the nation 's largest urban systems 
 but yesterday manhattan cable announced it will launch showtime on nov. N to over N subscribers 
 showtime has also accused hbo of <unk> up the lion 's share of hollywood 's movies by signing exclusive contracts with all the major studios 
 but showtime has continued to sign new contracts with hollywood studios and yesterday announced it will buy movies from columbia pictures entertainment inc. which currently has a <unk> arrangement with hbo 
 the federal trade commission said it authorized its staff to seek a preliminary injunction barring imo industries inc. from acquiring the shares outstanding of the u.s. unit of the british company united scientific holdings plc for $ N million

 the ftc said it would seek to <unk> the proposed acquisition in a federal trial court but declined to specify which one

 the airline industry 's fortunes in <unk> shape for most of the year have taken a sudden turn for the worse in the past few weeks 
 citing rising fuel costs promotional fare cuts and a general slowdown in travel several major carriers have posted or are expected to post relatively poor third-quarter results 
 yesterday usair group inc. recently one of the industry 's <unk> performers posted a <unk> $ N million net loss for the period 
 so far the industry 's fourth quarter is n't looking too strong either prompting many analysts to slash earning projections for the rest of the year by as much as <unk> 
 and they say the outlook for N is nearly as bad 
 airlines in N came in like a bang and are going out like a <unk> said kevin murphy an airline analyst at morgan stanley & co 
 this turn of events has put a big <unk> on an industry that seemed almost <unk> last spring when fares were rising at double-digit rates and many carriers seemed to be growing fat on <unk> in certain markets 
 now many airline companies might become a lot less attractive as takeover targets on wall street 
 the downturn also raises questions about the carriers ' ambitious orders for new airplanes which currently total $ N billion over the next three years 
 for travelers though the industry 's problems have had some positive effects 
 in recent weeks airlines have cut numerous fares in leisure markets to try to win back customers 
 others have tried to <unk> up <unk> programs 
 previously airlines were limiting the programs because they were becoming too expensive 
 just last week for example trans world airlines and pan am corp. 's pan american world airways went so far as to offer cash rebates or gift checks of $ N to $ N to certain <unk> members making <unk> flights in business class or first class 
 the industry 's slowdown became apparent this month when amr corp. parent of american airlines reported an N N drop in third-quarter net income and said its fourth quarter would be disappointing 
 shortly before that usair had said its third-quarter results would be significantly lower than a year earlier 
 yesterday it provided the details 
 its loss of $ N million or $ N a share <unk> with net of $ N million or $ N a share in the N third quarter 
 revenue rose only N N in the latest period to $ N billion from $ N billion 
 for the nine months the <unk> va. company 's net plunged N N to $ N million or N cents a share from $ N million or $ N a share 
 revenue rose N N to $ N billion from $ N billion 
 the results surprised many analysts because usair has almost no competition in its pittsburgh hub and has expanded operations by completing its acquisition of <unk> airlines 
 shortly after announcing its quarterly loss usair 's stock tumbled $ N a share 
 it ended at $ N down $ N in new york stock exchange composite trading 
 nobody was expecting this size of a loss said paul <unk> an analyst with first boston corp 
 one airline executive who declined to be identified called the loss amazing 
 in announcing the results usair cited many of the same problems that several other industry officials have named recently 
 it said the industry 's domestic traffic was flat in the third quarter analysts say this was because hefty fare increases earlier in the year scared off many leisure travelers this summer 
 to try to combat the traffic slowdown airlines started reducing fares average fares rose only N N in august in contrast to increases of N N each in february and march 
 but so far the effort has failed and traffic is still slow 
 some other fare promotions have <unk> 
 this summer the industry introduced a kids fly free program in which children were allowed to fly free if they were traveling with an adult 
 airlines tried to restrict the program substantially by limiting the offer to certain days of the week but it still was apparently used far more heavily than the airlines expected 
 airlines also say their <unk> programs are <unk> profits because <unk> are being redeemed at a <unk> rate 
 one airline official said about three times as many <unk> coupons are being turned in as in previous years not surprisingly as the airlines last year allowed many travelers to build up <unk> at triple the normal rate 
 rising operating expenses are another problem 
 fuel costs were up N N in the third quarter 
 labor costs which <unk> off in the past few years because of lower pay <unk> for newer employees are on the <unk> again at many carriers 
 and some carriers are facing other unexpected headaches usair for example blamed some of its loss on merger expenses and on disruptions caused by hurricane hugo last month 
 we can not <unk> the total adverse effects of hugo said edwin <unk> chairman and president of usair group 
 whatever the cause for the downturn few people are predicting any sudden improvement 
 airline economics inc. an aviation consulting firm is projecting an industrywide operating profit of $ N billion for N compared with earlier forecasts of $ N billion to $ N billion 
 as for N the firm predicts that profit will slip to between $ N billion and $ N billion

 all the <unk> though have some marketing experts questioning whether the party may go too far 
 there are too many people participating says al <unk> of <unk> & <unk> a greenwich conn. marketing consulting firm 
 if you want to cut through the clutter you have to make your message as distinct sharp and individual as possible 
 sharing a character with other advertisers is n't a way to do that 
 but united media says it 's very <unk> with the contracts it hands out 
 we 're not interested in promoting every single product that comes along mr. shore says

 stock of united airlines parent ual corp. <unk> wildly yesterday amid speculation that one or more investors may challenge the ual board 's decision to remain independent instead of pursuing a buy-out or other transaction 
 the board 's decision announced after the market closed monday initially prompted a severe sell-off in ual shares which at midday traded as low as $ N a share down $ N a share in composite trading on the new york stock exchange 
 the <unk> <unk> for takeover-stock traders who by then had seen ual stock tumble N N since oct. N also triggered a <unk> sell-off that sent the dow jones industrial average down more than N points at N a.m 
 but then steady concentrated buying by bear stearns & co. which frequently buys stock for corporate raiders took hold and <unk> the fall in ual which eventually buoyed the entire market 
 the industrial average closed down only N points at N 
 late in the afternoon several big purchases by bear stearns particularly a block of N shares at N p.m. at $ N a share triggered a buying spree that took ual up more than N points in the final hour of trading 
 ual stock closed at $ N a share down $ N 
 volume was a tumultuous N million shares or N N of the N million ual shares outstanding 
 traders estimated that bear stearns bought more than N million shares 
 the two most frequently rumored buyers neither of whom would comment were coniston partners which battled the ual board in N and new york real estate developer donald trump who recently made and withdrew an offer for american airlines parent amr corp 
 however one person familiar with ual said the signs pointed to coniston because mr. trump has n't asked for permission to buy more than $ N million of stock under federal antitrust rules 
 takeover-stock traders <unk> by their huge losses in ual stock remained eager for some action by an outside catalyst following the collapse oct. N of a $ 300-a-share $ N billion labor-management buy-out 
 their hope was that the catalyst would seek to oust the board in a solicitation of shareholder <unk> 
 baker nye investments a new york takeover-stock trader that owns ual stock would n't comment on reports the firm is considering seeking such a shareholder vote 
 but partner richard nye said this is the most extraordinary failed transaction i 've seen in N years in this business 
 it would make sense for somebody to do it 
 i have never seen a case of <unk> shared by so many participants 
 in N baker nye <unk> a proxy fight for control of leaseway transportation inc. that ultimately led to leaseway 's being sold 
 some traders pointed hopefully to earlier estimates by ual 's investment adviser first boston corp. that <unk> could yield $ N to $ N a share 
 but those would require pilots ' cooperation 
 any investor who acquires ual stock in an attempt to force a buy-out or recapitalization must deal with united 's contentious unions 
 the pilots are working under an expired contract and the machinists contract expires next month 
 that gives them enormous leverage including the threat of a strike to block any buy-out or recapitalization attempt they oppose 
 however a catalyst like coniston could seek shareholder support for a sale to a labor-management group at the last price discussed by that group before the board meeting monday 
 the pilots had been working on a buy-out bid between $ N and $ N a share or $ N billion to $ N billion 
 one person familiar with ual said the unsettled labor situation and the uncertain world-wide financial markets contributed to the board 's decision to avoid rushing around selling the company at a bargain price particularly since it accepted a $ 300-a-share offer just last month 
 even some takeover-stock traders said they could n't <unk> with the board 's logic 
 but the board 's decision prompted many to bail out of the stock yesterday 
 we had a lot of people who threw in the towel today said <unk> ellis a partner in benjamin jacobson & sons a specialist in trading ual stock on the big board 
 another trader noted that many arbitrage firms are afraid to sell their ual stock at the bottom but already own so much they ca n't buy any more 
 this deal is like a <unk> motel he said 
 they check in but they ca n't check out 
 but both the traders and the pilots remain interested in some transaction 
 so too according to many reports is british airways plc despite its public withdrawal from the buy-out 
 the pilots might end up <unk> up with their longtime <unk> the machinists union in a recapitalization 
 the machinists are reviewing proposals they made in the past for <unk> that would pay a special shareholder dividend and give employees a minority stake 
 the company rejected those past proposals 
 it is unclear however if the machinists would support a majority stake as the pilots want 
 a <unk> official said that would depend on how much in concessions machinists would have to give in return for the majority stake 
 some investors whose names were <unk> about by traders as potential ual stock buyers said they were n't buying 
 i 'm not interested said dallas investor harold simmons 
 a source close to carl icahn a corporate raider who owns trans world airlines inc. said he has n't owned any ual stock and is n't buying 
 one person familiar with texas billionaire robert bass said he is n't likely to make any hostile moves 
 and a spokesman for reliance group holdings inc. which had held N N of ual before the first buy-out bid but later reduced its holdings below N N would n't comment 
 marvin davis whose $ N billion takeover bid originally put the nation 's second-largest airline in play is limited by a standstill agreement with ual he signed in september 
 the los angeles investor ca n't buy ual stock <unk> shareholder <unk> or make a new offer unless he makes a formal offer of $ N a share or ual <unk> an offer below $ N 
 however mr. davis could pressure the board by asking that the agreement be <unk> or letting it be known that he has financing for an offer at a lower price 
 times mirror co. said third-quarter net income fell N N to $ N million or N cents a share compared with net income of $ N million or N cents a share a year earlier 
 the los angeles media concern said that the year-ago period included a $ N million gain from the sale of assets primarily <unk> 
 revenue was $ N million up N N from $ N million 
 stronger results from the company 's broadcast and cable television units and professional and <unk> publishing divisions plus increased advertising at the company 's largest newspaper the los angeles times offset advertising declines in the company 's newspapers in the eastern u.s. the company said 
 looking ahead to the fourth quarter the outlook for the newspaper group remains <unk> with no improvement yet seen in operating trends in our eastern markets said robert f. <unk> times mirror 's chairman and chief executive 
 copper futures sold off sharply yesterday influenced by declines in the stock market and dollar and a rally in bonds 
 december copper opened near monday 's close tried to rally but failed and then triggered stop-loss orders on its way down to settle at $ N a pound off N cents for the day 
 stop-loss orders are placed previously with instructions to execute them if the market hits a <unk> price 
 william kaiser president of the kaiser financial group in chicago said the decline was almost certainly influenced by the early sell-off in the stock market which partly reflected a weakening economy 
 he said the recent decline in copper stocks was misleading in the face of a slowdown in manufacturing 
 mr. kaiser said traders could have picked up signals of an imminent price decline had they been watching the scrap metal markets which became <unk> weaker two to three weeks ago 
 but though a weakening economy implies reduced demand mr. kaiser said that third world <unk> countries have n't any choice but to sell copper 
 they might even step up sales in a falling market he said in an effort to maintain the flow of foreign exchange into their <unk> 
 technically mr. kaiser noted that a lot of traders had bought into the market when the price was in the $ N to $ N range thinking there was support at the $ N level 
 when the market fell below that level on monday and then yesterday could n't climb above that level traders started selling out their positions 
 <unk> <unk> senior metals analyst at prudential-bache securities in new york agreed that most of the selling was of a technical nature 
 she said the market hit the $ N level at around N a.m. edt where it encountered a large number of stop-loss orders 
 more stop-loss orders were touched off all the way down to below $ N where modest buying was attracted 
 ms. <unk> said the settling of strikes in canada and mexico will have little effect on supplies of copper until early next year 
 she thinks the next area of support for copper is in the $ N to $ N range 
 i believe that as soon as the selling <unk> somewhat we could see a rally back to the $ N region she added 
 she thinks a recovery in the stock market would help copper rebound as well 
 she noted that the preliminary estimate of the third-quarter gross national product is due out tomorrow and is expected to be up about N N to N N 
 if the number is a little better then copper will respond <unk> if it is worse then more selling could <unk> she predicted 
 ms. <unk> noted that relating economic numbers to specific market activity is tricky 
 yesterday for example the durable goods numbers came out for september and the number was down only N N she said 
 however if you exclude <unk> orders then durable goods were down N N 
 i believe that number reflects a slowing economy 
 she said copper traders will also be looking toward the release of the index of leading economic indicators next tuesday 
 however david <unk> president of <unk> & co. an international metals company noted that so far this year copper consumption is way ahead of the same period of N and that projected production is below last year 
 mr. <unk> said the copper market seems to be anticipating a recession in three months with declining use being the result 
 but he added we have had that exact same perception six times in the last six years 
 he noted that currently the ratio of available copper to consumption is about N weeks 
 he said the normal ratio is five to six weeks 
 according to mr. <unk> the <unk> in copper production is n't at the mines but at the copper refineries 
 it takes three months to turn copper concentrate into <unk> he said 
 if there is n't a recession he said we will be out of copper by the end of march 
 if there is a recession that will change the statistical situation 
 he thinks that without a recession copper prices could exceed a high of $ N a pound which was reached last year 
 in the past mr. <unk> has been known to have substantial long positions that is he had bought copper futures in anticipation of rising prices in the copper futures market 
 in other commodity markets yesterday 
 energy the attitude was <unk> in crude oil futures yesterday in trading on the new york mercantile exchange 
 prices for the u.s. benchmark west texas intermediate crude remained locked in a fairly narrow range before ending the session four cents lower at $ N a barrel for december delivery 
 several analysts and brokers said the petroleum market was ready to rally after two days of price declines from profit-taking 
 but an early <unk> drop in the dow jones industrial average stopped the crude rally cold 
 the industrial average recovered to close only N points lower but petroleum futures never shook off the <unk> 
 most market participants said they were looking to this week 's inventory statistics from the american petroleum institute to give the market some direction 
 the report is n't generally available until late on <unk> 
 precious metals futures prices inched upward in mostly lackluster trading 
 december gold was up $ N an ounce at $ N december silver gained N cents to $ N an ounce 
 january platinum rose $ N an ounce to $ N 
 mr. kaiser said there were no fundamental factors moving these markets 
 he noted that two weeks ago there were rumors of soviet sales of precious metals to finance grain purchases but the sales do n't seem to have materialized 
 ms. <unk> thought yesterday 's price action reflected weakness in the stock market and the dollar 
 gold still acts as a haven when uncertainty <unk> in the financial markets as it did yesterday she said 
 mr. kaiser noted that gold was more than N times the price of silver at the close yesterday which is historically high 
 the high ratio reflects the fact that silver is still regarded as about a <unk> metal and its price lagging relative to gold says that traders are expecting a weakening economy he said 
 grains and soybeans prices closed lower after trading in relatively narrow ranges because of strong selling in the cash market and continued favorable harvest weather 
 the sale to the chinese government of N metric tons of wheat under the government 's export <unk> program was announced after the close of trading monday but the sale was expected and failed to <unk> prices yesterday said dale <unk> a futures analyst with drexel burnham lambert inc. in chicago 
 as for other export customers the soviet union is n't expected to be back buying u.s. corn in significant amounts until early next year he said 
 a number of commercial grain users <unk> that opinion yesterday by buying certain corn options for delivery in march indicating to analysts that the commercial companies would use the options to hedge against expected corn sales in next year 's first quarter 
 cocoa futures at first continued the rally begun on monday but then faltered and closed lower 
 the december contract opened just under monday 's close triggered some previously placed buy orders just above $ N a metric ton pushing the price to $ N and then encountered heavy selling by traders who buy and sell for their own accounts and by commercial interests 
 the contract settled at $ N a ton off $ N 
 robert <unk> senior commodities analyst at kaiser financial group said monday 's rally continued yesterday for only about N minutes after the opening 
 he said even though there was arbitrage buying in new york because of the weak dollar cocoa fell to <unk> pressure from bearish traders 
 but he noted that speculators apparently do n't believe there is much more of a decline in store for cocoa 
 the december contract reached its <unk> low of $ N a ton on oct. N its lifetime high was $ N set in N and its recent high was $ N set in early august 
 the last time cocoa traded at prices as low as currently was in N 
 but while further modest declines might be ahead mr. <unk> said it would be difficult to get through resistance levels just above yesterday 's high 
 citizens first bancorp inc. said it agreed to buy <unk> first financial group inc. a <unk> n.j. bank holding company for about $ N million in cash and stock 
 citizens first which controls citizens first national bank and is based in <unk> rock n.j. will pay a maximum of N N in cash for the parent of <unk> savings bank and the remainder in convertible preferred stock with a liquidation value of $ N a share 
 <unk> holders will have the option to request either stock or cash 
 the convertible preferred will pay dividends at N N and be convertible into shares of citizens first at a rate equal to N N above the average closing price of the stock during a <unk> period prior to the transaction 's completion 
 the deal requires regulatory and shareholder approval 
 color systems technology inc. los angeles said its major creditor general electric pension trust agreed to convert $ N million of debt owed into N N of color system 's fully diluted common stock 
 the agreement also calls for general electric pension a unit of general electric co. to receive as much as N N of color systems ' fully diluted common stock depending on the proceeds from the sale of the <unk> film library and its receivables 
 general electric pension took control of the <unk> library last month after color systems defaulted on the loan 
 the agreement depends on color systems ' ability to win similar concessions from other creditors 
 buddy young president said the company expects to conclude negotiations with other creditors within N days 
 color systems which <unk> black-and-white film to color <unk> posted a loss of $ N million or $ N a share on revenue of $ N million for the fiscal year ended june N 
 its stock fell N cents to $ N in american stock exchange composite trading yesterday 
 next to kohlberg kravis roberts 's <unk> rjr nabisco deal sci television is small <unk> 
 but the troubles of sci tv are a classic tale of the leveraged buy-out excesses of the 1980s especially the <unk> game 
 sci tv which expects to release a plan to restructure $ N billion of debt in the next day or so is n't just another lbo that went bad after <unk> on debt though it did do that 
 the cable and tv station company was an lbo of an lbo a set of assets that were leveraged twice enabling the blue-chip buy-out king henry kravis in N to take more than $ N billion of cash out of the <unk> <unk> 
 sci tv 's buy-out was an <unk> in the hole for mr. kravis and for investors in kkr partnerships 
 but it has left holders of sci tv 's junk bonds holding the bag including some <unk> that kkr might need to finance future deals such as kemper financial services first executive columbia savings & loan and prudential insurance co. of america 
 some junk-holders are said to be considering legal action against kkr or moves to force sci tv into bankruptcy court 
 and kkr 's majority partner in sci tv 's buy-out <unk> tenn. entrepreneur george gillett also is said to be very unhappy 
 sci tv 's six stations once were part of storer communications 
 kkr loaded up the cable and television company with debt in an N buy-out then later sold storer 's cable operations at a fat profit 
 in N kkr for the second time <unk> debt onto storer 's tv stations selling them for $ N billion to a new entity that was <unk> by kkr and <unk> by gillett corp. which now operates the sci tv stations 
 in this second lbo kkr with one hand took more than $ N billion of cash out of the tv company 's assets and moved it into the storer cable operations making them more valuable in a N sale 
 storer also took $ N million of junior sci tv bonds as partial payment for the tv assets 
 with the other hand kkr put back into sci tv less than N N of the cash it had taken out buying sci tv common and preferred shares 
 so while kkr today has an estimated $ N million <unk> in <unk> sci tv including equity and debt the lbo firm still is $ N billion ahead on the sci tv buy-out after taking cash up front 
 on storer as a whole kkr racked up compound annual returns of N N in the three years it owned storer 
 meanwhile mr. gillett risks losing his entire equity investment of about $ N million in sci tv if the company ca n't be restructured 
 overall mr. gillett 's holding company gillett holdings is heavily <unk> and except for its <unk> mountain resorts is n't doing very well 
 with the tv business falling on hard times in recent years analysts say that if sci tv had to be liquidated today it might fetch N N less than in the N buy-out <unk> out most of the company 's junk-holders and its stockholders 
 meanwhile sci tv can barely pay its cash interest bill and to stay out of bankruptcy court it must soon <unk> a lot of bank loans and junk bonds that have fallen due 
 sci tv 's grace period for paying its bills is due to expire nov. N 
 it now is quietly circulating among creditors a preliminary plan to restructure debt 
 negotiations have started con <unk> but that 's not to say we like this particular offer says wilbur ross of rothschild inc. adviser to sci tv junk-holders 
 no major player in the sci tv deal will talk publicly 
 but it 's understood that mr. kravis is disappointed that mr. gillett did n't manage to boost sci tv 's operating profit after the buy-out 
 mr. kravis apparently thinks sci tv can survive if lenders extend its debt payments until tv stations rise in value again allowing sci tv to sell assets to pay debt 
 mr. gillett is said to be proud of his operating record he has lifted some stations ' ratings and turned around a detroit station 
 as for junk-holders they 're <unk> it can be a mistake to take the other side of a trade by kkr 
 the bonds of sci tv now are being quoted at prices ranging from only five cents to about N cents on the dollar according to <unk> smith & co. in new york which trades <unk> securities 
 people who have seen sci tv 's restructuring plan say it offers concessions by kkr and gillett corp 
 they would both give part of their combined $ N million in common equity in sci tv to holders of sci tv 's $ N million of junk bonds as a <unk> to persuade them to accept new bonds that might reduce the value of their claims on the company 
 but some <unk> sci tv junk-holders say that 's not enough 
 they contend that sci tv 's equity now is <unk> 
 they add that it is n't costing kkr anything to give up equity because of its big <unk> cash profit on the buy-out which they think contributed to sci tv 's current problems 
 kemper the biggest holder of senior sci tv bonds has refused to join the <unk> committee and is said to be reviewing its legal options 
 to protect their claims some junk-holders want kkr and perhaps mr. gillett to invest new money in sci tv perhaps $ N million or more 
 one investment banker who is n't involved in the deal says sci tv needs at least $ N million of new equity to survive 
 junk-holders say they have a stick to beat kkr with the threat of bankruptcy is a legitimate tool to extract money from kkr says one big sci tv holder 
 this could be the first major bankruptcy-law proceeding for kkr he adds 
 a big bankruptcy-court case might <unk> kkr 's name and provide new fuel for critics of lbos in washington and elsewhere 
 but others say junk-holders have nothing to gain by putting sci tv into bankruptcy-law proceedings 
 while kkr does n't control sci tv which is unusual for a kkr investment it clearly has much deeper pockets than mr. gillett 
 bankruptcy specialists say mr. kravis set a precedent for putting new money in sour lbos recently when kkr restructured <unk> <unk> furniture doubling kkr 's equity stake 
 but with <unk> kkr was only trying to salvage its original investment says bankruptcy investor james rubin of <unk> <unk> rubin in new york 
 by contrast kkr probably has already made all the money it can on sci tv 
 and people who know mr. kravis say he is n't in a hurry to pour more money into sci tv 
 rubbermaid inc. reflecting strong earnings growth boosted its quarterly dividend N N to N cents a share from N cents 
 the maker of household products said the new dividend is payable dec. N to shares of record nov. N 
 separately the company 's board adopted a proposal to <unk> its N shareholder rights plan further <unk> the company from takeover 
 rubbermaid officials said they are n't aware of any effort to take over the company but believed the shareholder plan needed to be strengthened 
 the board has stated repeatedly that rubbermaid should be independent said walter w. williams rubbermaid president 
 some changes to the plan were minor adjustments but the most significant was an amendment that provides that if any investor holds N N or more of rubbermaid 's voting securities each right held by others would <unk> the holder to buy rubbermaid shares with a market value of twice the right 's exercise price 
 mr. williams said the exercise price is $ N meaning holders would have the right to buy $ N of rubbermaid stock for half price <unk> the investor 's N N stake 
 for the third quarter rubbermaid earned $ N million or N cents a share up N N from $ N million or N cents a share a year earlier 
 sales rose N N to $ N million from $ N million 
 rubbermaid shares closed yesterday at $ N off N cents in new york stock exchange composite trading 
 the stock market went on a dizzying ride as ual parent of united airlines once again led shares into a <unk> decline and then an afternoon comeback 
 at the end of it all the dow jones industrial average closed down N to N 
 at one point yesterday morning the dow was down N points 
 new york stock exchange volume was N shares 
 declining issues <unk> advancers N to N 
 yesterday 's sell-off and rebound was a powerful reminder that N days after the 190-point plunge on friday the 13th the stock market still has a bad case of nerves 
 takeover stock speculation and futures-related program trading drove the industrial average through wide ranges 
 and there is more volatility to come 
 october 13th left us with a cut and exposed <unk> said jack <unk> technical analyst for bear stearns 
 people are fearful and sensitive 
 everybody 's finger is one inch closer to the <unk> 
 i have never had as many calls as i had this morning 
 volatility is here to stay 
 the dow jones industrial average plunged about N points in slightly more than one hour after the opening bell 
 for many it began to look like a <unk> of oct. N 
 as stocks and stock-index futures fell a trading limit was hit in the s&p N stock futures pit 
 under a <unk> crash reform the chicago mercantile exchange would n't permit the december s&p futures to fall further than N points for a half hour 
 that caused a brief period of panic selling of stocks on the big board 
 but at a critical moment stock-index arbitrage traders showed their power and control 
 they <unk> up hundreds of s&p futures when the market needed it most 
 at about N a.m. edt several big buy orders hit the s&p pit simultaneously lifting the futures up out of the trading limit and eventually into ranges that caused computer-driven program buying of stocks

 after being <unk> by a volatile stock market treasury bonds closed higher 
 but junk bonds took more hits 
 early in the day bond dealers said trading volume was heavy as large institutional investors scrambled to buy long-term treasury bonds on speculation that the stock market 's volatility would lead to a <unk> rally 
 that happens when nervous stock investors dump equities and buy treasurys which are higher in quality and thus considered safe 
 some retail accounts such as commercial banks and pension funds wanted to get on the <unk> before it was too late said sung won <unk> chief economist at <unk> corp. minneapolis 
 at one point the dow jones industrial average fell about N points on news that ual corp. decided to remain independent 
 in response treasury prices soared N N points or about $ N for each $ N face amount 
 but the gains in treasury bonds were <unk> as stocks staged a partial recovery 
 the industrial average ended at N down N points 
 economists said the bond market 's strength also is a sign that investors expect the federal reserve to cut interest rates amid growing evidence that the economy is slowing 
 while they do n't expect the fed to move right away they say the case for lower rates is building 
 yesterday for example the commerce department reported that new orders for durable goods fell N N while the nation 's auto makers reported lackluster mid-october sales 
 the treasury 's 30-year bond ended over N point higher

 also the tw offering includes <unk> and <unk> securities which are currently unpopular 
 meanwhile investors turned a cold shoulder to the treasury 's sale of $ N billion of new two-year notes yesterday 
 it 's not too surprising that the auction was sloppy given the volatility in the bond market because of stocks said robert t. <unk> a senior vice president at <unk> bank ltd

 sluggish demand was also <unk> by the weak <unk> <unk> ratio which was lower than the average <unk> ratio at the last N similar auctions 
 the ratio which reflects the number of bids the treasury receives for each bid accepted is used to gauge investor demand 
 dealers said players <unk> away from the note sale because they were concerned that prices at the time of the auction might erode if the stock market staged a recovery which in fact did happen 
 individual and japanese participation in the auction was disappointing according to dealers 
 interest by japanese investors was limited said michael <unk> chief economist at daiwa securities america inc 
 they are typically not active in two-year note auctions but today 's participation could be viewed as <unk> 
 however mr. <unk> added that the japanese generally have a positive view of the u.s. bond market because of expectations that the dollar will remain strong and interest rates will decline 
 he said possibly they 're waiting to buy at the quarterly refunding of government debt to be held next month by the treasury 
 a trader at a japanese firm estimated that the japanese purchased no more than N N of the two-year notes 
 treasury agency securities 
 today investors will focus on the long-awaited auction of $ N billion of 30-year bonds by resolution funding corp 
 the initial bond offering by the new government agency which was created to help rescue the nation 's troubled thrifts is n't expected to see robust demand 
 a small yield premium over comparable treasurys and a lack of liquidity is <unk> dealers ' efforts to drum up interest in the so-called bailout bonds

 yesterday the benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late at N N to yield N N compared with N N to yield N N on monday 
 the latest 10-year treasury was quoted at N N to yield N N compared with N N to yield N N 
 short-term rates were unchanged to slightly lower 
 the discount rate on three-month treasury bills was quoted at N N for a bond-equivalent yield of N N while the rate on six-month treasury bills was quoted at N N for a yield of N N 
 rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value 
 thus higher bidding narrows the investor 's return while lower bidding widens it

 the <unk> accounting practice is widely recognized within lloyd 's as of serious concern to the N member investors who underwrite insurance at lloyd 's in return for premium and investment income lloyd 's said 
 the procedure causes great uncertainty because an investor ca n't be sure of his or her individual liability lloyd 's said 
 as a result the insurance market plans new measures to restrict the ability of syndicate officials to leave years open 
 lloyd 's said it expects to enact new rules <unk> the changes by year end 
 under the new rules the officials will have to secure additional information and reports from <unk> including an assessment of whether officials have acted reasonably 
 in addition officials will have to get quotes for certain reinsurance contracts and obtain approvals from other syndicate directors 
 computer associates international inc. reported earnings for the second quarter ended sept. N plummeted N N primarily because of the acquisition of <unk> software inc 
 the nation 's largest software company earned $ N million or five cents a share compared with $ N million or N cents a share a year earlier 
 revenue rose N N to $ N million from $ N million 
 the drop in earnings had been anticipated by most wall street analysts but the results were reported after the market closed 
 computer associates closed at $ N down N cents in composite trading on the new york stock exchange 
 anthony wang president attributed the drop to the disruption of the company 's business resulting from the prolonged process of acquiring <unk> 
 the acquisition was completed in september 
 in august the company warned investors that the acquisition was being delayed and many customers were holding off on purchase decisions until the takeover was completed 
 the delays mainly affected sales of data base management products a core area for both computer associates and <unk> as well as sales of other products as part of package sales

 the issue was very <unk> disney is such a well-known you can say world-wide name said <unk> <unk> head trader of european equities at kleinwort benson ltd. which is making a market in the issue 
 mr. <unk> estimated that the issue 's london debut was accompanied by very very heavy turnover between five million and six million shares 
 most of the buying was institutional he added 
 official trading in the shares will start in london paris and brussels on nov. N when the <unk> <unk> offering valued at the equivalent of nearly $ N billion comes to market in the european community 
 u.s. investors will be permitted to buy the shares from ec investors N days later 
 because of the interest connected with the issue the london exchange took the unusual step of letting traders establish an officially <unk> when-issued market 
 a volatile <unk> gray market in the shares has been operating in paris for about two weeks

 ford motor co. <unk> its battle with general motors corp. over jaguar plc by saying it is prepared to make a bid for all of the british auto maker when restrictions on its <unk> are lifted 
 the statement was part of a ford filing with the u.s. securities and exchange commission 
 ford did n't say how much it might offer for jaguar or when 
 the british government currently <unk> any outside investor from holding more than N N of the company 's shares without permission until dec. N 
 but with its stake in jaguar which it raised yesterday to N N ford could <unk> a special jaguar shareholders ' meeting and urge holders to vote to drop the restriction sooner 
 a successful vote would put pressure on the british government to lift the restriction 
 we have not made that decision to seek a jaguar special shareholders ' meeting said <unk> <unk> a ford spokesman in london 
 he emphasized that the car maker only would bid for all of jaguar under the right circumstances and said those circumstances are n't right or possible at the moment 
 last month ford announced plans to acquire as much as N N of jaguar 
 since then jaguar officials have confirmed that they are discussing an alliance with gm and said last week that they hoped to reach an agreement within a month 
 analysts have been expecting a <unk> pact that would give the u.s. car maker an eventual N N stake in the british company and create joint ventures that would produce an <unk> range of cars 
 but the specter of ford eventually launching a <unk> bid could <unk> the <unk> talks 
 jaguar seems to be losing interest in giving gm a minority stake said one individual close to the talks adding it would n't surprise me if jaguar executives want to wait and see what the color of that ford bid is first 
 he predicted ford officials will meet with jaguar executives in the next week to <unk> their proposed offer 
 sir john <unk> jaguar 's chairman so far has refused to meet with ford officials but he is believed to be willing to consider a specific bid proposal 
 as for gm its <unk> position has to be a full bid itself said stephen reitman european <unk> analyst at london brokers <unk> & drew 
 a ford takeover of jaguar would have such implications for the balance of power in the 1990s that general motors ca n't afford to step aside 
 they will have to throw their hat in the ring 
 a gm spokesman yesterday reiterated the company 's interest in acquiring a minority stake to help jaguar remain independent 
 a pitched battle could mean jaguar would fetch # N $ N a share or about # N billion $ N billion several analysts believe 
 the prospect of such a takeover fight has sent jaguar shares soaring in recent weeks 
 u.s. takeover-stock speculators now own an estimated N N of jaguar shares 
 in a declining london stock market yesterday jaguar shares were down four pence from monday in late trading at N pence $ N a share 
 in the u.s. jaguar 's american depositary receipts rose N cents in over-the-counter trading to $ N 
 both ford and gm badly need a luxury brand to combat new competition from the japanese in the european and u.s. markets 
 and financially strapped jaguar has spent over a year looking for a rich uncle to provide cash and technological know-how 
 the company has expressed a preference for gm over ford because gm has promised it would keep jaguar independent 
 ford 's need to acquire some or all of jaguar became more <unk> last week when it abandoned a four-year effort to market its <unk> merkur scorpio sedan as a european luxury import in the u.s. 
 then last friday ford 's talks about a possible alliance with saab-scania ab of sweden collapsed 
 gm 's interest in jaguar reflects a desire to help diversify the u.s. company 's products in the growing luxury-car segment of the market 
 its <unk> line has a solid image and a recent string of highly successful new models but it lacks jaguar 's <unk> 
 gm officials also see a lot of potential in <unk> jaguar 's cars to the technological know-how of group lotus plc a british engineering and specialty car maker gm bought in N

 third-quarter net income at texaco rose to $ N million from $ N million last year

 overseas exploration and production results also improved because of additional output from the north sea <unk> field a portion of which was acquired by sun earlier this year

 shell oil 
 profits of shell a subsidiary of the royal <unk> group tumbled $ N million or N N to $ N million despite a gain of $ N million from an insurance settlement

 revenue rose N N to $ N billion from $ N billion 
 chevron said higher crude oil prices boosted profits from production operations but margins in refining and marketing declined

 a # N million $ N million british airways plc rights issue <unk> badly the victim of recent market turbulence and the collapse of the buy-out bid for united airlines ' parent ual corp 
 the united kingdom carrier had planned the issue to help finance its $ N million purchase of a N N stake in ual 
 but british airways withdrew from the ual labor-management buy-out plan last friday after the group failed to get bank financing for its $ N billion buy-out 
 british airways said its shareholders accepted only N N of the convertible capital bonds but that the rest of the issue will be taken up by underwriters 
 analysts said that N N level marked the poorest showing for any major british rights issue since the N global stock market crash 
 it is close to being a record <unk> said bob <unk> an analyst with london broker smith new court securities 
 fund managers do n't like to have rights issues that do n't have an obvious reason 
 the obvious reason was for british air to buy a stake in united airlines 
 in a statement british air chairman lord king said the company was obviously disappointed that the issue was not taken up but it would have been <unk> to expect a better result given the volatility of the stock market since the launch of the issue 
 but except for the embarrassment british air will emerge relatively <unk> from the <unk> issue 
 underwriters led by lazard brothers & co. will pick up the rest of the airline 's offer of four convertible capital bonds for every nine common shares 
 lazard and other primary underwriters have reduced or eliminated their exposure by <unk> the issue among u.k. institutional investors 
 the paper loss here is very small for these <unk> observed john nelson a lazard managing director 
 in any case he added most institutions probably wo n't sell the bonds 
 and instead of buying the ual stake the u.k. carrier will be able to reduce its high debt level and build an acquisition war <unk> 
 from a cash flow point of view british airways is better off not being in united airlines in the short term said andy chambers an analyst at nomura research institute in london 
 added another u.k. analyst it gives them some cash in the back <unk> for when they want to do something 
 for instance british air is continuing to negotiate with <unk> royal dutch airlines about each acquiring a N N stake in <unk> world airlines the air transport subsidiary of the belgian national airline 
 a definitive agreement had been expected by the end of july 
 the failed rights issue also should have a modest impact on british air shares 
 the airline 's share price already is far below the N pence $ N level seen after the company announced the rights issue in late september 
 in late trading on london 's stock exchange yesterday the shares were off three pence at N pence 
 and because british air is issuing convertible bonds rather than ordinary shares the share price wo n't be directly hurt by any surplus left with underwriters after they try to sell the issue in the open market 
 but british air 's withdrawal from the ual buy-out could have further <unk> 
 some analysts speculated yesterday that the move has set off a board room split which may lead to the resignation of sir <unk> marshall the carrier 's chief executive officer 
 the stories are <unk> a british air spokesman said 
 there is no difference of opinion between chairman lord king and sir <unk> on any aspect of company policy

 in an oct. N editorial-page article it 's the world bank 's turn to adjust paul craig roberts <unk> most of the blame for what <unk> developing countries at the <unk> of the world bank 
 the article is unfortunately <unk> with <unk> <unk> 
 one of mr. roberts 's <unk> is that the bank 's own loan portfolio is in deep trouble because of its lending to developing countries 
 this is just not so 
 the reality is that bank finances are rock solid 
 as of june N N the day our past fiscal year came to a close only N N of the bank 's portfolio was affected by <unk> of over six months 
 this is an <unk> low level 
 moreover the bank follows a prudent <unk> policy and has set aside $ N million against possible loan losses 
 for the same fiscal year by the way the bank 's net income was a robust $ N billion after provisions 
 because of the <unk> manner in which the bank goes about development financial markets have confidence in it 
 this helps explain the triple-a rating enjoyed by our bonds and our ability to borrow $ N billion in fiscal N on the most <unk> terms 
 another of mr. roberts 's criticisms is that bank lending has done more harm than good by <unk> the wrong incentives and <unk> energy away from economic development 
 here too mr. roberts is way off the mark 
 the reality is that bank loans have been linked to policy improvements for N years 
 our traditional project loans have for instance supported <unk> energy pricing in the power sector sound interest-rate policies in the credit area and the operation of public utilities as efficient <unk> agencies 
 by and large these efforts have <unk> fruit 
 in my home region latin america much of the existing infrastructure base an important building block for development has been financed by the world bank 
 mr. roberts also takes a <unk> at the bank 's adjustment lending 
 what are the facts on this type of lending 
 the bank has been making adjustment loans for N years 
 as their name implies these operations are linked to far-reaching policy reforms that aim at helping borrowing countries get back on the growth path and at <unk> their <unk> 
 typically these measures include reforms to <unk> the role of government and <unk> in the economy to open up <unk> economies to international competition and to promote the development of a vigorous private sector 
 support for the private sector has been a longstanding concern of the bank 's 
 over the years it has helped encourage investments by entrepreneurs in the third world through its extensive credit operations and through loans and investments by the international finance corp 
 most recently the bank group has been expanded to include the <unk> investment guarantee agency to stimulate direct foreign investment in developing countries by offering guarantees against <unk> risk and advice to member countries on how to improve their business climate 
 these are not the actions of a development agency <unk> to central planning and to the concentration of investment decisions in the hands of government as mr. roberts alleges 
 rather they reflect the bank 's <unk> <unk> approach which aims at ensuring that developing countries put their scarce resources to the best possible use

 mr. <unk> also said conasupo will cut back subsidies to producers of <unk> farm products and close retail outlets in wealthy neighborhoods 
 the agency 's workers and private companies would be allowed to bid for the assets up for sale 
 conasupo controls prices on agricultural goods and operates retail outlets where basic consumer items are sold at <unk> prices 
 business leaders have long criticized the agency as a leading example of <unk> waste 
 private-sector leaders praised the conasupo restructuring 
 but most economists doubt the streamlining would cut deeply into conasupo government subsidy which largely goes to reduce consumer prices for corn and milk

 it was agreed at the outset of the washington drug initiative that the fbi 's role would be to continue targeting the major drug traffickers through our national drug strategy 
 through these investigations we do not focus on the street drug user but rather we target and attack major <unk> organizations that control a large segment of the drug market 
 the trial of <unk> <unk> iii in washington serves to highlight our efforts in this area and the results achieved through our excellent working relationship with the drug enforcement administration and the metropolitan police department <unk> 
 the fbi 's role is to <unk> the d.c. initiative through not only these major trafficking investigations but also by providing a full range of services through various task forces and our contacts with local police <unk> handling drug-related crimes 
 in fact we have agents assigned full time to assist the <unk> in drug-related crimes such as <unk> and other crimes of violence

 the margin of error for <unk> for example married women with children at home would be larger

 mr. <unk> 's departure follows by two months the resignation of mark <unk> as senior vice president and chief marketing officer after only N months at reebok 
 the resignations by the two executives considered <unk> and <unk> by reebok insiders reflect a difference in style with paul fireman chairman and chief executive according to several former executives 
 the two executives are among a number of outsiders recruited by reebok in the past few years to help it make the transition from a small start-up company to a marketing giant with sales last year of $ N billion 
 the changes come as reebok which grew rapidly in the mid-1980s but has seen its sales <unk> of late is seeking to regain momentum in the <unk> business against rivals <unk> inc. and l.a. gear inc

 the company can go about its business 
 they 're in the midst of a turnaround she noted

 it 's simply the right time to do what we are doing mr. <unk> said 
 magazines can no longer be considered institutions said james <unk> president of meredith corp. 's magazine group 
 publishers will find that some magazines have served their purpose and should die he added 
 magazines could like other brands find that they have only a limited life 
 there are also indications that the number of magazine entrepreneurs traditionally depended upon to break new ground with potentially risky <unk> are <unk>

 in the process litigation sciences is quietly but <unk> <unk> the world of law 
 little known outside the legal world but a powerhouse within litigation sciences a unit of saatchi & saatchi plc employs more than N <unk> <unk> marketers <unk> artists and technicians 
 <unk> of its workers are <unk> <unk> 
 among other services the firm provides pre-trial opinion polls creates <unk> of ideal jurors sets up <unk> trials and shadow <unk> coaches lawyers and witnesses and designs courtroom graphics 
 much like their <unk> in political consulting and product marketing the litigation advisers encourage their clients to play down complex or <unk> matters <unk> their messages and provide their target audiences with a psychological <unk> to make the <unk> choice 
 with jury <unk> getting bigger all the time companies are increasingly willing to pay huge sums for such advice 
 recently litigation sciences helped pennzoil co. win a $ N billion jury verdict against texaco inc 
 it advised the national football league in its largely successful defense of antitrust charges by the united states football league 
 and it helped win defense <unk> in <unk> suits involving scores of products ranging from <unk> N tires to the <unk> drug <unk> 
 largely as a result litigation sciences has more than doubled in size in the past two years 
 its N revenue was $ N million 
 meanwhile competitors are being spawned almost daily some N new businesses many just <unk> shops have <unk> up 
 mr. vinson estimates the industry 's total revenues approach $ N million 
 in any <unk> case you can be sure that one side or the other or even both is using litigation consultants 
 despite their <unk> the consultants are n't entirely welcome 
 some lawyers and scholars see the social scientists ' vision of the american jury system as a far cry from the ideal presented in <unk> <unk> and <unk> on the movie screen 
 in the film classic twelve angry men the <unk> of deliberations <unk> each <unk> 's bias and <unk> it from playing a role in the verdict 
 after hours of conflict and debate that jury focuses on the facts with <unk> <unk> 
 in real life jurors may not always work that way but some court observers question why they should n't be encouraged to do so rather than be <unk> not to 
 litigation consulting is as new york trial attorney donald <unk> puts it highly <unk> 
 he adds the notion they try to sell is that <unk> do n't make decisions <unk> 
 but the effort is also being made to try and cause jurors not to decide things <unk> 
 i find it troubling 
 but mr. <unk> also acknowledges that consultants can be very effective 
 it 's gotten to the point where if the case is large enough it 's almost <unk> not to use them he says 
 others complain that the consultants ' growing influence <unk> the advantage of <unk> wealthy enough to afford such <unk> services 
 the affluent people and the corporations can buy it the poor <unk> in political cases get it free and everybody in between is at a disadvantage and that 's not the kind of system we want says <unk> <unk> a prominent sociologist who teaches at george washington university 
 sophisticated trial consulting grew ironically from the radical political movements of the 1960s and 1970s before finding its more lucrative calling in big commercial cases 
 the <unk> N trial in N in which daniel <unk> and others were charged with <unk> <unk> violence was a landmark 
 in that case a group of <unk> <unk> interviewed N registered voters around <unk> 
 the researchers discovered that <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> were nearly always against the defendants the lawyers resolved to try to keep them off the jury 
 the defense also learned that <unk> people were <unk> conservative about the vietnam war 
 a more blue-collar panel became a second aim 
 ultimately that carefully picked jury <unk> with a N vote to <unk> and the prosecution decided not to <unk> the case 
 litigation consulting had arrived 
 the fledgling science went corporate in N when international business machines corp. hired a marketing professor to help defend a complex antitrust case 
 the problem for ibm trial lawyers thomas <unk> and david <unk> was how to make such a highly technical case <unk> 
 as the trial <unk> they were eager to know if the jury was keeping up with them 
 the solution devised by the professor was to hire six people who would mirror the actual jury <unk> sit in on the trial and report their reactions to him 
 he then <unk> messrs. <unk> and <unk> who had the chance to tilt their next day 's presentation <unk> 
 thus the shadow jury was born 
 mr. vinson the professor got the law <unk> and formed litigation sciences 
 ibm won the case 
 the hardest thing in any complex case is to retain <unk> and in some sense your ignorance says mr. <unk> of <unk> <unk> & moore 
 what you look for in a shadow jury is very much what you do when you give an opening argument to your wife or a friend and get some response to it 
 a shadow jury is a way to do that in a more <unk> and organized way 
 the approach worked well in the recent antitrust case in which energy transportation systems inc. sued santa fe pacific corp. over the transport of <unk> coal the kind of case likely to make almost anyone 's eyes <unk> over 
 energy transportation retained litigation sciences at a cost of several hundred thousand dollars to poll <unk> profile and shadow 
 just before the actual closing arguments the firm put the case to a vote of the five shadow jurors each of whom was being paid $ N a day 
 the jurors who did n't know which side had retained them decided for energy transportation and awarded $ N million in damages 
 the real jury returned days later with a $ N million victory for energy transportation 
 it 's just like weather forecasting says energy transportation trial attorney harry <unk> of vinson & <unk> 
 it 's often wrong but it 's better than consulting an indian rain <unk> 
 forecasting is only one part of litigation sciences ' work 
 changing the outcome of the trial is what really matters 
 and to the <unk> some of the firm 's approaches may seem <unk> <unk> 
 <unk> jurors are supposed to weigh the evidence in a case <unk> and <unk> 
 instead mr. vinson says interviews with thousands of jurors reveal that they start with firmly entrenched attitudes and try to <unk> the facts of the case to fit their views 
 pre-trial <unk> helps the consultants develop a profile of the right type of <unk> 
 if it is a case in which the client seeks punitive damages for example depressed <unk> people are far more likely to grant them 
 someone with a master 's degree in classical arts who works in a <unk> would be ideal litigation sciences advises 
 so would someone recently <unk> or <unk> 
 since litigation sciences generally represents the defense its job is usually to help the lawyers identify and remove such people from the jury 
 for personal-injury cases litigation sciences seeks defense jurors who believe that most people including victims get what they deserve 
 such people also typically hold negative attitudes toward the <unk> handicapped the poor blacks and women 
 the consultants help the defense lawyers find such jurors by asking questions about potential jurors ' attitudes toward volunteer work or toward particular movies or books 
 litigation sciences does n't make moral <unk> 
 if a client needs <unk> jurors the firm will help find them 
 as mr. vinson explains it we do n't control the facts 
 they are what they are 
 but any lawyer will select the facts and the strategy to employ 
 in our system of <unk> the trial lawyer is duty bound to present the best case he possibly can 
 once a jury is selected the consultants often continue to determine what the jurors ' attitudes are likely to be and help shape the lawyers ' presentation <unk> 
 logic plays a minimal role here 
 more important are what lsi calls psychological <unk> a few <unk> points calculated to appeal to the jury on a gut level 
 in one personal-injury case a woman claimed she had been injured when she slipped in a pool but the fall did n't explain why one of her arms was <unk> <unk> 
 by repeatedly drawing the jury 's attention to the arm the defense lawyers planted doubt about the <unk> of the woman 's injuries 
 the <unk> worked 
 the defense won 
 in a classic defense of a personal-injury case the consultants concentrate on encouraging the jury to shift the blame 
 the ideal defense in a case involving an accident is to persuade the jurors to hold the accident victim responsible for his or her plight mr. vinson has written 
 <unk> graphics <unk> for effectiveness also play a major role in litigation sciences ' operation 
 studies show the consultants say that people absorb information better and remember it longer if they receive it <unk> 
 <unk> <unk> help 
 the average american watches seven hours of tv a day 
 they are very <unk> sophisticated explains lsi graphics specialist robert <unk> 
 lawyers remain divided about whether anything is wrong with all this 
 supporters acknowledge that the process aims to manipulate but they insist that the best trial lawyers have always employed similar tactics 
 they may not have been able to <unk> it all but they did it says stephen <unk> a legal ethics expert at new york university law school 
 what you have here is <unk> made <unk> 
 many lawyers maintain that all 's fair in the adversary system as long as no one <unk> with the evidence 
 others point out that lawyers in small communities have always had a feel for public sentiment and used that to advantage 
 litigation consulting is n't a guarantee of a favorable outcome 
 litigation sciences concedes that in one in N cases it was <unk> wrong in its predictions 
 a few attorneys offer <unk> stories of jobs <unk> by consultants or of <unk> services as when one lawyer paid a consultant not at litigation sciences $ N to interview a jury after a big trial and later read more <unk> interviews with the same jurors in the american lawyer magazine 
 some <unk> <unk> at the notion that a sociologist knows more than they do about what makes a jury <unk> 
 the <unk> of being a trial lawyer is understanding how people of diverse backgrounds react to you and your presentation says barry <unk> of simpson <unk> & bartlett who recently won a huge case on behalf of insurers against shell oil co 
 he says he used consultants in the case but found them to be virtually <unk> 
 but most lawyers accept that the marketplace has spoken 
 and the question remains whether the jury system can maintain its integrity while <unk> such a <unk> massage 
 for more than a decade mr. <unk> the sociologist has been a leading critic of the <unk> 
 there 's no reason to believe that <unk> rule <unk> he says 
 but the last thing you want to do is manipulate the <unk> to make them think better 
 what you then do is you make them think <unk> 
 to <unk> the work of litigation scientists he suggests that courts sharply limit the number of jurors that lawyers can remove from the jury panel through so-called <unk> challenges <unk> that do n't require <unk> 
 in most civil cases judges allow each side three such challenges 
 for complex cases judges sometimes allow many more 
 mr. <unk> also suggests <unk> anyone from gathering background information about the jurors 
 some courts release names and addresses and researchers can drive by houses look up credit ratings and even question neighbors 
 furthermore he says <unk> should not be allowed to analyze jurors ' <unk> 
 even some lawyers who have used consultants to their advantage see a need to limit their impact 
 mr. <unk> the first lawyer to use mr. vinson 's services <unk> against courts ' allowing extensive jury questioning known as <unk> dire or giving out personal information about the jurors 
 the more extensive the <unk> dire the easier you make it for that kind of research to be effective and i do n't think courts should lend themselves to that mr. <unk> says 
 silicon graphics inc. a fast-growing maker of computer workstations said it landed two federal government contracts worth more than $ N million over the next five years 
 one award is part of a department of defense contract to loral <unk> <unk> computers and could be valued at more than $ N million over five years 
 the other involves the sale of about N of the company 's high-end workstations to the national institutes of health 
 the models which cost about $ N each will be used in research 
 the <unk> are evidence that silicon graphics ' approach to computer graphics is catching on with users of powerful desktop computers analysts said 
 the company 's on a roll said robert <unk> an analyst at hambrecht & quist 
 no other computer vendor offers graphics performance that good for their price 
 in the battle to supply desktop computers for researchers and design engineers most of the attention is given to the biggest competitors sun microsystems inc. hewlett-packard co. and digital equipment corp. which make computers mainly aimed at a wide range of engineering and scientific needs 
 silicon graphics on the other hand has targeted a specific niche since its inception in N which has been dubbed by some as <unk> computing 
 this is a style of <unk> computing that provides <unk> color models of everything from the inside of a house to the latest in women 's fashion 
 though silicon graphics is much smaller than digital <unk> and sun it has emerged in recent years as a feared adversary in this graphics portion of the workstation market 
 in addition the company has made it tough on competitors by offering a stream of desktop computers at sharply lower prices 
 a year ago silicon graphics introduced a model priced at $ N almost as cheap as mainstream workstations that do n't offer special graphics features 
 silicon graphics also plans to unveil even less expensive machines in the near future 
 it 's pretty safe to assume we can bring the cost down of these systems by N N to N N a year said edward <unk> the company 's chief executive officer 
 silicon graphics ' strategy seems to be paying off 
 revenue for its first quarter ended sept. N was $ N million a N N increase over the year-ago period 
 profit was $ N million compared with $ N million for the year-ago quarter 
 remember those <unk> <unk> refrigerators of N years ago 
 they or at least something less efficient than today 's <unk> units may soon be making a comeback 
 that something whatever it is could add as much as $ N to the $ N or so consumers now pay for <unk> refrigerators 
 these and other expensive changes in products ranging from auto air <unk> to foam <unk> to commercial <unk> are in prospect because of something called the montreal protocol signed by N nations in N 
 in one of the most sweeping environmental regulatory efforts to date involving products with an annual value of $ N billion in the u.s. alone the <unk> agreed to curtail sharply the use of chlorofluorocarbons cfcs 
 world-wide production would be cut in half by N 
 the u.s. senate liked the treaty so well it ratified it by a vote of N to N 
 not to be <unk> george bush wants cfcs <unk> altogether by the year N a goal endorsed at an <unk> u.n. environmental meeting in <unk> in the spring 
 that 's a lot of <unk> as it turns out 
 cfcs are the primary <unk> in a gas often referred to by the du pont trade name <unk> which is <unk> to liquid form to serve as the cooling agent in <unk> and <unk> equipment 
 <unk> containing cfcs are pumped into <unk> to make the foam used in <unk> <unk> and <unk> 
 <unk> foam is a highly efficient <unk> which accounts for why the walls of refrigerators and <unk> can be <unk> now than they were back in the days when they were <unk> with glass fiber 
 but even though by some estimates it might cost the world as much as $ N billion between now and the year N to convert to other <unk> <unk> agents and <unk> and to <unk> equipment for these less efficient <unk> the montreal protocol 's <unk> of supporters say it is worth it 
 they insist that cfcs are damaging the earth 's <unk> ozone layer which screens out some of the sun 's <unk> <unk> 
 hence as they see it if something is n't done <unk> will become ever more subject to <unk> and skin cancer 
 peter teagan a specialist in heat transfer is running a project at arthur d. little inc. of cambridge mass. to find alternative technologies that will allow industry to eliminate cfcs 
 in addition to his interest in ozone depletion he has <unk> studied the related topic of global warming a theory that <unk> 's generation of carbon dioxide through increased combustion of fossil fuels is creating a greenhouse effect that will work important <unk> changes in the earth 's atmosphere over time 
 i would be the first to admit that there is not a complete consensus in the scientific community on either one of these problems says mr. teagan 
 in the kind of literature i read i come across <unk> opinions quite frequently 
 but the nature of the problem is such that many others feel it has to be addressed soon before all the evidence is in 
 we ca n't afford to wait 
 but does it have to be so soon 
 some atmospheric scientists think that even if cfcs were released into the atmosphere at an accelerating rate the amount of ozone depletion would be only N N by the middle of the next century 
 it 's easy to get something comparable by simply moving to a higher <unk> in the u.s. 
 moreover there are questions particularly among atmospheric scientists who know this subject best about the ability of anyone to know what in fact is happening to the ozone layer 
 it is generally agreed that when cfcs rise from earth to <unk> the <unk> in them is capable of <unk> with the process through which <unk> <unk> split <unk> <unk> and form ozone 
 but ozone creation is a very large-scale natural process and the importance of <unk> cfcs in reducing it is largely a matter of <unk> 
 the ozone layer is constantly in motion and thus very hard to measure 
 what scientists have known since the late 1970s is that there is a hole in the layer over <unk> that <unk> or contracts from year to year 
 but it is at least worthy of some note that there are very few refrigerators in <unk> 
 moreover surely someone has noticed that household refrigerators are closed systems running for many years without either the <unk> gas or the <unk> ever <unk> 
 another argument of the environmentalists is that if <unk> are available why not use them 
 mr. teagan cites a list of <unk> but none so far match the <unk> <unk> cfcs 
 <unk> and propane can be used as <unk> for example but are <unk> 
 moreover new lubricants will be needed to protect <unk> from the new <unk> which as with cfcs are <unk> 
 mr. teagan points out as well that if the equipment designed to get along without cfcs is less efficient than current devices energy consumption will rise and that will worsen the greenhouse effect 
 folks in the midwest who just suffered a mid-october <unk> may wonder where the greenhouse was when they needed it but let 's not be <unk> about grave risks 
 as it happens arthur d. little is not at all interested in throwing cold water on ozone depletion and global warming theories 
 it is interested in making some money advising industry on how to convert to a world without cfcs 
 there is after all big money in environmentalism 
 maybe we should ask why it was that du pont so quickly <unk> and issued a statement giving it wide publicity that it was <unk> cfcs 
 <unk> introduced in N <unk> america by making <unk> and air <unk> practical after all 
 one answer is that big companies are growing <unk> of fighting environmental movements and are trying instead to cash in on them although they never care to put it quite that way 
 du pont as it happens has a potential substitute for cfcs 
 imperial chemical industries of the u.k. also has one and is building a plant in louisiana to produce it 
 japanese chemical companies are at work developing their own <unk> and hoping to <unk> new markets of course 
 there are still others who do n't mind seeing new crises arise 
 environmental groups would soon go out of business were they not able to send out <unk> describing the latest threat and asking for money to fight it 
 university professors and consultants with scientific credentials saw a huge market for their services <unk> when price <unk> destroyed the energy crisis and thus the demand for alternative energy 
 they needed new crises to generate new grants and contracts 
 in other words environmentalism has created a whole set of vested interests that fare better when there are many problems than when there are few 
 that tends to tilt the public debate toward solutions even when some of the most knowledgeable scientists are skeptical about the <unk> of the threats and the insistence of urgency 
 there is an element of <unk> involved 
 consumers pay the bill for all this in the price of a <unk> or an <unk> car 
 if they were really getting insurance against environmental disaster the price would be cheap 
 but if there is no impending threat it can get to be very expensive 
 but worries about N 
 with most legislatures <unk> for the year small business is <unk> its <unk> 
 much of its attention was spent fighting organized labor 's initiatives on issues the small-business community traditionally opposes from raising state minimum wage levels to <unk> benefits in health plans 
 while results were mixed in many states small business got by fairly well concludes don l. robinson associate director of the national federation of independent business the largest small-business organization 
 five states oregon <unk> island new hampshire iowa and wisconsin passed bills to boost the minimum wage but measures in N other states were defeated 
 oregon 's rate will rise to $ N an hour the nation 's highest in jan. N N 
 iowa 's will be the second highest at $ N an hour in january N but small-business lobbyists won an exclusion for tiny concerns and a lower training rate 
 in N central states one small-business count shows lawmakers adopted only three of N bills <unk> health coverage or parental leave 
 the illinois legislature narrowly passed a <unk> bill which gov. james thompson vetoed and iowa and tennessee amended laws to require that employers pay for <unk> <unk> 
 small business is bracing for an <unk> of similar proposals next year 
 those kinds of issues always keep coming back says robert <unk> who manages the illinois chamber of commerce 's small-business office 
 despite victories this year small business fears losing <unk> war 
 only two states vermont and washington this year joined five others requiring private employers to grant leaves of absence to employees with <unk> or adopted <unk> 
 similar proposals were defeated in at least N other states 
 but small business which generally <unk> <unk> benefits has taken note of the growing number of close votes 
 it 's just a matter of time before the tide turns says one midwestern lobbyist 
 consequently small business is taking more <unk> steps to counter mandated leaves 
 in pennsylvania small businesses are pushing for a voluntary alternative they favor a commission that would develop sample leave policies that employers could adopt 
 they also support a tax credit for employers to offset the cost of hiring and training workers who temporarily replace employees on parental leave 
 in N the issue is expected to be especially close in alaska california michigan new york pennsylvania and illinois 
 we 'll be playing a lot of defense especially in the midwest and northeast says jim <unk> of the <unk> 
 in los angeles more small businesses <unk> adopting a child-care policy 
 triggering the <unk> is a recent city council decision to give preference in letting city contracts to suppliers with a stated policy on child care for their employees

 firms are permitted wide flexibility in the child-care arrangements they provide 
 council member <unk> <unk> the measure 's chief advocate considers it part of a <unk> policy that makes los angeles a leader in <unk> the workplace 
 november <unk> will contain few <unk> or initiative issues that especially affect small business

 previously regulators insisted that franchisers <unk> such changes with the state a costly process taking at least six weeks

 such buyers must have a minimum net worth of $ N million $ N annual income or recent experience in the business area of the franchise being sold 
 but critics consider the changes <unk>

 about N commuters trying to find their way through the bay area 's <unk> transportation system <unk> <unk> into <unk> sat in traffic <unk> on major freeways or waited <unk> for buses yesterday 
 in other words it was a <unk> manhattan commute 
 city officials feared widespread gridlock on the first day that normal business operations were resumed following last tuesday 's earthquake 
 the massive temblor which killed at least N people <unk> the bay bridge a major artery to the east and closed most <unk> leading to and from highway N the biggest artery to the south 
 it will take several weeks to repair the bridge and several months to repair some of the N connections 
 but in spite of a <unk> <unk> gridlock never materialized mainly because the bay area rapid transit subway system carried N N more passengers than normal 
 for the first time in memory it was <unk> only in bart 's <unk> modern <unk> 
 moreover the two main bridges still connecting san francisco with the east bay did n't charge <unk> allowing traffic to zip through without <unk> 
 officials also suspect that traffic benefited from steps by major employers to get workers to come in at odd hours or that many workers are still staying at home 
 many commuters who normally drove across the bay bridge which is shut down for several weeks because of damage to one span actually may have reached work a bit faster on bart yesterday provided they could find a parking space at the system 's <unk> stations 
 in the best of times the bay bridge is the worst commute in the region often experiencing <unk> of N to N minutes or more 
 not that getting into town was easy 
 storm flooding caused <unk> on the freeway and many commuters had to find <unk> to bart 's stations because parking lots were full before <unk> 
 bus schedules were sometimes in disarray <unk> commuters such as <unk> sullivan 
 her commute from <unk> calif. normally takes an hour and N minutes via the golden gate bridge which <unk> san francisco with the north bay area 
 yesterday she was still waiting at a bus stop after three hours trying to transfer to a bus going to the financial district 
 it 's worse than i thought she said 
 i do n't know where all the buses are 
 but while traffic was heavy early in the commute over the golden gate by N a.m. it already had <unk> out 
 it 's one of the <unk> <unk> i 've ever had said charles <unk> an insurance broker on the bus from mill valley in <unk> county 
 it looks like a holiday 
 i think a lot of people got scared and stayed home 
 however a spokeswoman for bankamerica corp. said yesterday 's <unk> at the bank holding company was no greater than on an average day 
 at the san mateo bridge which <unk> the san francisco peninsula with the east bay police were surprised at the speed with which traffic moved 
 everybody pretty much pitched in and <unk> said <unk> <unk> a <unk> with the california highway <unk> 
 there were many indications that the new work hours implemented by major corporations played a big role 
 the golden gate handled as many cars as normally yesterday but over four hours rather than the usual <unk> crush 
 <unk> group inc. the giant closely held engineering concern says it has instituted a N a.m. to N p.m. <unk> arrangement <unk> employees may select any <unk> period during those hours to go to work

 one senior vice president at <unk> said he got up at N a.m. to drive into san francisco from the east bay 
 but transportation officials worry that such extraordinary measures and cooperation may not last 
 although one transportation official said drivers who did n't use car pools were committing an <unk> act about two-thirds of the <unk> crossing the golden gate were alone compared with the normal N N rate 
 and some commuters relieved by the absence of gridlock were planning to return to their old ways 
 <unk> kasparov went to combat sunday with the world 's most advanced <unk> computer and kicked it around <unk> anyway like an old <unk> can 
 playing black in the first game the human champion <unk> deep thought known for its attacking <unk> into a totally passive position 
 then he <unk> his own <unk> attack 
 and in the second game with mr. kasparov advancing <unk> as white d.t. offered <unk> resistance and lost even faster 
 well <unk> can rest easier for now 
 though almost everybody at the playing site had been looking for the <unk> soviet to beat the <unk> computer he gave the machine a far worse <unk> than many expected 
 and when mr. kasparov <unk> into the playing hall he called the outcome 
 as if he were iron mike about to enter the ring with a <unk> <unk> he declared i 'll be able to beat any computer for the next five years 
 his strategy against d.t. was based on a <unk> study of dozens of its games he said including its notorious <unk> of the <unk> <unk> larsen of <unk> and robert <unk> of the u.s. 
 mr. kasparov was <unk> 
 the computer 's mind is too straight too <unk> lacking the <unk> and creativity needed to reach the top he said 
 the champion apparently was not worried at all about d.t. 's strong points 
 its chief <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> his <unk> the <unk> for its tactical <unk> at <unk> out of horrible positions 
 d.t. also has a <unk> and <unk> memory is utterly <unk> and could n't be <unk> by the <unk> <unk> <unk> spread around the playing hall in the new york academy of art 
 in fact d.t. never left home <unk> mellon university in pittsburgh but <unk> with its human <unk> by telephone link 
 they conceded that the odds favored mr. kasparov but they put their hope in d.t. 's recently enhanced capacity for <unk> positions up to a million per second from N 
 but the <unk> mistakenly stuck with silicon chips they needed <unk> 
 this became apparent as game one a <unk> defense by mr. kasparov <unk> 
 no human can examine millions of moves but mr. kasparov using his <unk> powerful brain consistently found very good ones 
 after eight moves by each side the board was the same as in a game in which nigel short of great britain fought the champion to a draw in N 
 but the computer did n't play mr. short 's ninth move a key pawn thrust and its position deteriorated rapidly 
 instead of <unk> a standard measure to <unk> the king d.t. made a <unk> <unk> maneuver at move N then it put a knight <unk> on move N 
 only two classes of minds would think of this very weak human players and computers said <unk> <unk> the expert <unk> for the match which was attended by hundreds of <unk> fans 
 by move N d.t. had fallen into a deep <unk> trap 
 it allowed mr. kasparov to exchange his <unk> <unk> for one of d.t. 's <unk> 
 <unk> usually are worth slightly more than <unk> but in this case mr. kasparov was left with a very dangerous knight and d.t. 's surviving <unk> was reduced to <unk> 
 indeed it looked more like a pawn a tall pawn as <unk> <unk> put it 
 consistently d.t. was <unk> about its chances which it continually <unk> up in <unk> form 
 when most <unk> thought its position <unk> the computer thought it was only in effect one-half of a pawn down 
 such <unk> met with <unk> and kept the machine from resigning as soon as humans would have prompting more <unk> 
 while d.t. <unk> its king back and forth in a defensive <unk> mr. kasparov <unk> the knight to a dominant <unk> 
 he also launched a <unk> storm <unk> a pawn to <unk> d.t. 's king 
 no amount of <unk> could have saved this game for <unk> 
 a piece down the computer resigned 
 now with the crowd in the analysis room <unk> <unk> blood the only question seemed to be how fast mr. kasparov could win game two 
 with the advantage of playing white which moves first mr. kasparov followed up <unk> against the computer 's defense a queen 's <unk> accepted 
 as early as move six mr. kasparov <unk> from a well-known <unk> of moves developing a knight instead of making a standard <unk> attack against the computer 's advanced knight 
 this left the computer with a broader range of <unk> replies and it immediately <unk> by moving a <unk> pawn to the <unk> of <unk> development 
 in a new position just after the opening a computer will have serious problems mr. kasparov said later 
 in such positions he explained you have to create something new and the computer is n't able to do that right now 
 after only N moves for each side the computer 's position was shaky 
 <unk> it grabbed a pawn at the cost of facing a <unk> attack 
 and when a defensive move was called for d.t. passed up an obvious pawn move and instead exposed its queen to immediate tactical threats 
 mr. kasparov <unk> later that even a weak club player would have avoided the queen move 
 now after only a dozen moves <unk> were looking for a <unk> combination 
 on a demonstration board <unk> <unk> <unk> showed a quick kill initiated by a knight sacrifice no <unk> <unk> this line of play 
 mr. kasparov 's <unk> was slower but in the end just as deadly 
 he won d.t. 's queen for two minor pieces and two <unk> not enough compensation in this position to give the computer much hope 
 in a <unk> position the computer resigned rather than make its <unk> move 
 and mr. kasparov to <unk> and applause marched back into the analysis room 
 in both games i got exactly what i wanted he said 
 what he had demonstrated he added is that there 's more to <unk> than sheer <unk> 
 <unk> d.t. 's <unk> vowed to press on 
 indeed three of them will be building a successor machine for international business machines corp 
 promises <unk> <unk> in three years we 'll mount a better challenge 
 mr. <unk> is a reporter in the journal 's new york bureau 
 reaching for that extra bit of yield can be a big mistake especially if you do n't understand what you 're investing in 
 just ask richard blumenfeld a new jersey <unk> who considers himself a reasonably sophisticated investor 
 in may N dr. blumenfeld gave merrill lynch & co. about $ N for a federally insured certificate of deposit offering an effective yield of more than N N 
 it was a time when interest rates came down very rapidly dr. blumenfeld recalls 
 yields on five-year cds at major banks were averaging about N N and 10-year treasury notes were paying less than N N 
 the cd seemed like a great deal 
 but nearly N N years later merrill says the investment is worth about $ N an amount that represents an annual return of just over N N on dr. blumenfeld 's $ N 
 the problem is that the cd he bought for a retirement plan was n't a plain <unk> cd 
 instead his merrill broker put him in a zero-coupon cd which is sold at a deep discount to its face value 
 the difference between the price and the face value payable at maturity is the investor 's return 
 more important the cd was purchased on the secondary or resale market 
 because the cd had an effective yield of N N when it was issued in N and interest rates in general had declined sharply since then part of the price dr. blumenfeld paid was a premium an additional amount on top of the cd 's base value plus accrued interest that represented the cd 's increased market value 
 now the thrift that issued the cd is insolvent and dr. blumenfeld has learned to his surprise that the premium is n't insured under federal deposit insurance 
 the <unk> came when he opened a recent merrill lynch statement and found that the cd 's estimated current market value had plummeted by $ N in a month 
 several phone calls and a visit to his broker 's office later the <unk> found out that the $ N drop represented the current value of the premium he paid when he bought the cd and that the amount was n't insured 
 this is one thing i was never aware of he says 
 he assumed that principal and interest were fully insured up to $ N he adds 
 dr. blumenfeld is n't unique 
 especially at times like these when declining rates make it hard for investors to get yields they have come to expect too many people chase the promise of <unk> returns without fully <unk> the risk 
 yield greed often gets in the way of understanding things says john <unk> research director of the american association of individual investors a chicago-based educational group 
 the biggest problem we have is that investors realize after the fact that they did n't understand what they were investing in 
 dr. blumenfeld concedes he did n't fully understand what he was buying 
 he says that he knew he was getting a zero-coupon cd and that he had previously invested in <unk> treasury income growth receipts a type of zero-coupon treasury security sold by merrill lynch 
 but he says he did n't understand he was buying the cd on the secondary market and he contends his broker never fully explained the risks 
 the broker thomas <unk> of merrill lynch 's morristown n.j. office refuses to discuss the matter with a reporter referring inquiries to merrill lynch officials in new york 
 those officials say there was full disclosure of the risks in a fact sheet sent to all cd investors with their confirmation of sale 
 the fact sheet dated april N says on page three if the price paid for a cd purchased in the secondary market is higher than the <unk> value in the case of zero-coupon cds the difference is not insured 
 <unk> involving zero-coupon cds are more complicated and you should discuss any questions you may have with your financial consultant 
 dr. blumenfeld says he does n't remember the <unk> about premiums in the fact sheet he received and did n't realize part of what he paid was a premium 
 i assumed i was buying a cd as a cd he says 
 nevertheless merrill lynch has agreed that if the thrift that issued dr. blumenfeld 's cd peoples heritage federal savings & loan association in <unk> kan. is liquidated and the cd terminated the brokerage firm would cover the premium dr. blumenfeld paid 
 federal deposit insurance would pay principal and interest accrued to the date of liquidation to a maximum of $ N 
 it 's not a blanket commitment it 's a <unk> situation says albert <unk> a managing director of merrill lynch money markets inc 
 there 's a question whether brokers at the time were fully aware of the risks 
 we were n't sure that full disclosure as we wanted it was being made 
 merrill lynch says it 's impossible to estimate how many investors are in dr. blumenfeld 's situation although it says the firm has received only one other complaint about premiums on the secondary market in three years 
 merrill lynch now provides credit rating information about the institutions whose cds it sells which it did n't provide in N 
 zero-coupon cds are only a small portion of the $ N <unk> in cds outstanding and those purchased on the secondary market are an even smaller part of the total 
 merrill lynch estimates that fewer than N financial institutions currently issue zero-coupon cds 
 still there are several billion dollars of zero-coupon cds with various maturities outstanding 
 because of the tax consequences of zero-coupon investments income tax is payable in the year interest is accrued although interest is n't actually paid until maturity zero-coupon cds are usually sold for <unk> accounts to finance things like retirement and children 's education 
 most zero-coupon cds are in maturities of six to nine years and they usually double in value by maturity 
 but investors who bought zero-coupon cds in the secondary market are n't the only ones who may be surprised to learn the full amount of their investments is n't insured 
 people who paid a premium for standard cds purchased on the secondary market could also find that those premiums are n't insured if the institutions that issued the cds failed 
 however those premiums are usually far smaller than on zero-coupon cds and the simpler pricing structure of a standard cd makes it more apparent when a premium is paid 
 whatever the case a merrill lynch spokesman <unk> investors should n't have to worry about the uninsured premium issue unless the bank or thrift that issued the cd is closed and its deposits paid off before maturity or transferred to another institution at a lower rate 
 dr. blumenfeld says he 's satisfied that his problem has been resolved 
 and he says he 's learned a lesson you always have to watch out for yourself 
 no one else will watch out for you

 while franchisees were having a tough time holding sales mcdonald 's <unk> stores posted hefty gains for the nine months with sales per <unk> unit rising $ N

 carnival cruise lines inc. 's common stock was dragged down yesterday amid concerns that a bankruptcy filing by a finnish <unk> would delay delivery of three big cruise ships 
 the miami-based company 's stock fell $ N yesterday to $ N a share in heavy american stock exchange composite trading 
 early yesterday carnival said in a company statement that it had been notified <unk> that waertsilae marine industries the finnish shipyard that is building its three new cruise ships planned to file for bankruptcy 
 officials at carnival declined to comment 
 there is just a tremendous amount of uncertainty about what the effect if any of all this is said john p. <unk> an analyst at raymond james associates inc 
 i did n't even know that a company in a <unk> country could file for bankruptcy 
 carnival said the fantasy the first of the three $ N million ships that carnival has on order is scheduled to be delivered next month just in time for the winter tourist season in the caribbean 
 that ship which would carry about N passengers would expand the capacity of carnival 's existing <unk> fleet by N N 
 the second ship which is <unk> is scheduled to be delivered in fall N and the third in fall N 
 there 's a N N chance that the fantasy will be delivered close to schedule said <unk> levy an analyst at shearson lehman hutton inc 
 the others will probably be delivered as well but carnival will likely have to pay a higher price for them 
 she said the company could pay as much as N N more for the ships 
 if the ships are n't delivered however it will likely have an effect on the company 's earnings as soon as the N fiscal year which begins dec. N 
 analysts said those estimates which range from about $ N a share to $ N a share are based on fantasy being in operation in N 
 if the ship fails to arrive those per-share earnings estimates could be trimmed N cents or more 
 analysts were n't willing to speculate on how much money carnival might lose through deposits 
 normally a company pays a portion of the total cost of a ship as it reaches various stages of construction 
 carnival for example has already paid about $ N million of the total cost for fantasy 
 some analysts say this may give it the right to seize the ship if the situation warrants it

 eaton corp. had a N N drop in third-quarter profit mainly because of lower sales of truck parts its largest and most profitable single business 
 sales of medium and <unk> trucks continue to lag <unk> rates leading eaton to expect fourth-quarter net income to fall below year-earlier levels said stephen r. <unk> vice chairman and chief financial and administrative officer 
 he declined to make a specific earnings estimate 
 third-quarter net was $ N million or $ N a share from $ N million or $ N a share a year ago 
 sales rose N N to $ N million from $ N million 
 the quarter net was below analyst expectations mainly because <unk> sales did n't rebound in september from the summer doldrums as they usually do said patrick e. <unk> analyst with mcdonald & co 
 mr. <unk> who had been expecting quarter profit of about $ N a share says he is reducing his estimate for the year to the area of $ N a share from his previous estimate of $ N 
 eli <unk> of painewebber inc. who a couple of weeks ago reduced his N estimate to $ N a share because of the weakening truck market says he will make another cut to about $ N a share in light of the third-quarter report 
 he said eaton 's quarter profit margin on controls was lower than he anticipated 
 eaton said sales of truck <unk> <unk> and other parts fell N N to $ N million 
 sales of parts for cars and construction vehicles rose 
 eaton does n't provide profit figures separately for each category but operating profit for vehicle parts as a group fell N N to $ N million on an about N N drop in sales to $ N million 
 mr. <unk> said <unk> operators appear to be cautious about buying new trucks until they see how the economy <unk> 
 the truck sales slowdown reflects the general slowing in sales of consumer goods he said and the latest reports show a slight improvement rather than any indication of a downward <unk> 
 operating profit from electrical and electronics controls eaton 's other major business group fell N N to $ N million despite a N N increase in sales to $ N million 
 the company attributed the decline to weakness in the <unk> market in north america and in the european <unk> market 
 for the nine months net including profit from discontinued operations both years and in N an extraordinary charge of $ N million related to settlement of a lawsuit was $ N million or $ N a share up N N from $ N million or $ N a share a year ago

 in poland 's rapid shift from socialism to an <unk> alternative environmental issues have become a cutting edge of broader movements to restructure the economy cut <unk> <unk> and <unk> local politics 
 initial steps were taken at poland 's first international environmental conference which i attended last month 
 the conference held in lower <unk> was <unk> by the environment ministry the rockefeller brothers fund and the polish ecological club and was attended by N poles from government and industry as well as <unk> <unk> russians japanese and americans 
 the conference was entitled economic <unk> for environmental protection a significant departure from east bloc usage which recognizes only one economic mechanism central planning to direct industrial behavior 
 even more <unk> it focused on emissions trading and similar market approaches to address pollution notwithstanding poland 's lack of <unk> markets 
 why did east bloc participants unanimously <unk> <unk> pollution approaches 
 the answer lies both in the <unk> environment of these countries and the perceived causes of that <unk> 
 like other east bloc countries poland <unk> environmental laws more <unk> in their breach than in their <unk> 
 according to a detailed report by <unk> <unk> of the university of minnesota 's <unk> <unk> institute N areas containing a third of poland 's population are regarded as ecological hazards due to multiple violations of standards 
 <unk> are consistently exceeded at N N of <unk> <unk> monitoring sites and N N of those for dust and <unk> emissions 
 <unk> of poland 's <unk> have become highly <unk> N N of its southern <unk> are projected to die by century 's end 
 between N and N polish waters fit for human consumption dropped from N N to N N of all surface waters while those <unk> even for industry use nearly doubled 
 poland produces about N times more <unk> and five times more <unk> dioxide and solid waste per unit of gross national product than does western europe 
 its mortality rate for males over N is about N N higher than west germany 's and N N higher in hazard areas than the national average 
 since N average annual growth rates for most <unk> have <unk> the growth of gnp 
 conference participants saw these effects as flowing directly from a marxist devaluation of environmental resources which are not produced by labor b planned economies ' inability to control pollution where enterprises are state-owned and penalties are paid by the government and c the continuing <unk> emphasis on heavy industry for economic development producing a far heavier and more <unk> use of energy and natural resources than in the west 
 they repeatedly noted that environmental progress could not be secured without true ownership genuine competition based on market factors and the risk of bankruptcy if a business makes the wrong decisions 
 the solutions they formally proposed included <unk> taxes conservation and recycling incentives <unk> <unk> <unk> pollution permits an ecological bank to finance <unk> credits and <unk> swaps 
 but their most fundamental recommendation was to separate industry from the state making it fully <unk> for pollution control 
 a revolution takes more than conference <unk> 
 indeed skepticism was <unk> captured by a joke told by poles at the conference the world must be coming to an end 
 the russians are talking peace 
 the <unk> are talking elections 
 and the poles are engaged in commerce 
 but the implications of such a shift to market approaches go well beyond the fact that poland is already working on nationwide emissions trades to reduce <unk> pollution or that the soviets plan to introduce <unk> pollution permits in some republics next year 
 those implications include privatization 
 faced with a $ N billion foreign debt and <unk> inflation poland must <unk> industry and eliminate subsidies to stabilize its currency and qualify for international assistance 
 <unk> pollution control may consume some capital that would otherwise purchase state industries 
 but it could also accelerate <unk> by reinforcing industrial accountability breaking up state monopolies giving managers a stake in solutions and ensuring that modernization is not <unk> for failure to address environmental effects 
 <unk> solutions 
 as conferees noted scarce capital means the costs of control must be <unk> through a broad <unk> of compliance choices for individual firms 
 that means simple clear rules that secure the first large blocks of reduction deferring more complex issues such as risk 
 it also means use of <unk> pollution limits such as <unk> permits rather than <unk> limits such as <unk> fees 
 that 's because <unk> managers will likely respond better to quantity than to price signals 
 creative financing 
 even <unk> environmental solutions will require billions of dollars 
 new types of financing must make funds available without <unk> poland 's <unk> reserves 
 <unk> 
 east bloc pollution data typically have been state secrets 
 while polish data have been freely available since N it was no accident that participants urged the free flow of information 
 for once information flows public participation follows and repression becomes difficult to <unk> 
 global <unk> 
 one participant <unk> declared that america has had a free market in goods but a planned economy for environmental protection while poland represents the opposite 
 his point it will be increasingly difficult for the u.s. to <unk> to <unk> measures if even the east bloc steps to a different <unk> 
 at the moment poland resembles <unk> pittsburgh more than a modern industrial society with <unk> production inadequate environmental management and little ecological awareness 
 but the continuing pressures for free-market economics suggest the conference 's vision was not all fantasy

 disappointing earnings news from some technology companies <unk> investors in the over-the-counter market who sold shares of apple computer intel and many other <unk> concerns 
 the drop in those and other technology stocks contributed to an N N slide by the nasdaq composite index

 it 's a quiet retreat said mr. <unk> 
 it 's nothing dramatic just a routine sell-off 
 some of it was due to lower-than-expected earnings from leading companies he said

 why ca n't we teach our children to read write and <unk> 
 it 's not that we do n't know how to because we do 
 it 's that we do n't want to 
 and the reason we do n't want to is that effective education would require us to <unk> some <unk> <unk> <unk> about human nature in general and the human nature of young people in particular as well as to violate some <unk> vested interests 
 these <unk> so dominate our educational establishment our media our politicians and even our parents that it seems almost <unk> to challenge them 
 here is an example 
 if i were to ask a sample of american parents do you wish the <unk> schools to encourage creativity in your children the <unk> answer would be yes of course 
 but what do we mean specifically by creativity 
 no one can say 
 in practice it ends up being <unk> with a <unk> that encourages the youngsters ' <unk> 
 the result is a generation of young people whose ignorance and intellectual <unk> is matched only by their good opinion of themselves 
 the whole notion of creativity in education was and is part and parcel of a romantic <unk> against disciplined instruction which was and is regarded as <unk> a repression and frustration of the <unk> <unk> and the wonderful if as yet <unk> <unk> inherent in the <unk> of all our children 
 it is not surprising that parents find this romantic <unk> so attractive 
 fortunately these same parents do want their children to get a decent education as traditionally understood and they have enough common sense to know what that demands 
 their commitment to creativity can not survive <unk> <unk> 
 american education 's future will be determined by the degree to which we all of us allow this common sense to prevail over the <unk> that we also share 
 the education establishment will fight against common sense every inch of the way 
 the reasons are complex but one simple reason ought not to be underestimated 
 <unk> education as it was once called is far more interesting and <unk> to teachers than is disciplined instruction 
 it is nice for teachers to think they are engaged in <unk> development and even <unk> to minimize those <unk> tests with often disappointing results 
 it also provides teachers with a superior <unk> as a profession since they will have passed courses in educational psychology and educational philosophy 
 i myself took such courses in college thinking i might end up a <unk> 
 they could all fairly be described as <unk> courses 
 but it is unfair to dump on teachers as distinct from the educational establishment 
 i know many <unk> and on the whole they are seriously committed to <unk> teaching 
 they may not be among the best and <unk> of their generation there are very few such people by definition 
 but they need not be to do their jobs well 
 yes we all can remember one or two truly <unk> teachers from our school days 
 but our education <unk> at the hands of those others who were merely competent and <unk> 
 in this sense a teacher can be compared to one 's family doctor 
 if he were brilliant he probably would not be a family doctor in the first place 
 if he is competent and <unk> he serves us well 
 our teachers are not an important factor in our educational crisis 
 whether they are or are not <unk> is a problem of equity it is not an educational problem 
 it is silly libel on our teachers to think they would educate our children better if only they got a few thousand dollars a year more 
 it is the kind of libel the teachers ' unions do n't mind spreading for their own narrow purposes 
 it is also the kind of libel politicians find useful since it helps them strike a friendly posture on behalf of an important constituency 
 but there is not one <unk> of evidence that other things being equal salary <unk> result in educational <unk> 
 if there were such evidence you can be sure you would have heard of it 
 if we wish to be serious about american education we know exactly what to do and just as important what not to do 
 there are many successful schools scattered throughout this nation some of them in the poorest of <unk> and they are all sending us the same message 
 <unk> there are the majority of unsuccessful schools and we know which efforts at educational reform are doomed <unk> 
 we really do know all we need to know if only we could <unk> this knowledge into our thinking 
 in this respect it would be helpful if our political leaders were <unk> rather than <unk> concerned 
 they are inevitably inclined to echo the conventional <unk> since this is the least controversial option that is open to them 
 thus at the recent governors ' conference on education gov. bill clinton of arkansas announced that this country needs a comprehensive <unk> policy for children under five 
 a comprehensive development policy for governors over N would seem to be a more pressing need 
 what gov. clinton is <unk> in effect is extending the educational system down to the <unk> years 
 whether desirable or not this is a child-care program not an educational program 
 we know that very early exposure to <unk> improves performance in the first grade but afterward the difference is quickly <unk> away 
 let us sum up what we do know about education and about those education reforms that do work and do n't work parental involvement is a bad idea 
 parents are too likely to blame schools for the educational limitations of their children 
 parents should be involved with their children 's education at home not in school 
 they should see to it that their kids do n't play <unk> they should make certain that the children spend enough time doing <unk> they should <unk> the report card 
 if parents are <unk> with a school they should have the option of switching to another 
 community involvement is an even worse idea 
 here the experience of new york city is decisive 
 locally elected school boards especially in our larger cities become the <unk> of ambitious generally corrupt and invariably <unk> local politicians or would-be politicians 
 new york is in the process of trying to <unk> itself from a <unk> commitment to this system of school <unk> even as chicago and other cities are moving to institute it 
 in most states increasing expenditures on education in our current circumstances will probably make things worse not better 
 the reason is simple education takes place in the classroom where the influence of money is minimal 
 decades of educational research tell us <unk> that even smaller classes have zero effect on the academic performance of the <unk> though they may sometimes be desirable for other reasons 
 the new money flows into the already <unk> administrative structure which <unk> itself <unk> more and more paper work on the teachers 
 there is neither mystery nor <unk> in the fact that as educational expenditures in real terms have increased sharply in the past <unk> we now spend more per <unk> than any other country in the world educational performance has declined 
 that is the way the system works 
 students should move up the educational <unk> as their academic potential allows 
 no student should be permitted to be <unk> from <unk> school without having <unk> the N r 's at the level that prevailed N years ago 
 this means tracking whose main purpose is less to permit the <unk> youngsters to <unk> though that is clearly desirable than to ensure that the less <unk> get the necessary <unk> for further study or for entering the modern world of work 
 the notion that tracking is somehow <unk> is absurd 
 the purpose of education is to encourage young men and women to realize their full academic potential 
 no one in his right mind actually believes that we all have an equal academic potential 
 it is generally desirable to use older <unk> many of them <unk> out of print rather than newer ones 
 the latter are <unk> trendy often downright silly and at best <unk> 
 they are based on dubious psychological and <unk> theories rather than on educational experience 
 one of the reasons american students do so poorly in <unk> tests as compared with british french german or japanese students is the influence of the new <unk> on american <unk> and teaching methods 
 anyone who wants to appreciate just how bizarre this situation is with students who ca n't add or <unk> learning the conceptual basis of <unk> theory should read the article by <unk> nelson himself a recent <unk> major at harvard in the november american <unk> 
 most important of all schools should have principals with a large measure of authority over the faculty the <unk> and all matters of student discipline 
 study after study the most recent from the <unk> institution tells us that the best schools are those that are free of outside <unk> and are <unk> by a powerful head 
 with that authority of course goes an <unk> accountability 
 schools that are structured in this way produce students with higher morale and superior academic performance 
 this is a fact though in view of all the <unk> that are <unk> by this fact it is not surprising that one <unk> so little about it

 international business machines corp. unveiled a broad strategy to tackle the biggest problem that manufacturers face when <unk> their operations most machines ca n't talk to each other 
 the company unveiled more than N products mostly software that are designed to integrate the three areas of a manufacturing operation the plant floor design operations and production planning 
 the aim ultimately is to increase the flow of information into a manufacturer 's main computer network for use in business planning marketing and other operations 
 manufacturers have already spent so heavily on <unk> that they are one of the computer industry 's leading revenue sources 
 but many manufacturers find that communication between different computers has been <unk> nearly impossible by the <unk> of computer <unk> used by different machines including robots and machine tools 
 ibm 's announcement which was expected and will formally be made to customers today also marks an attempt to gain credibility on the plant floor where digital equipment corp. has long dominated and where hewlett-packard co. has recently gained market share 
 consultants have said that it will take a while for all the pieces of the ibm strategy to fall into place even though the specific products ibm unveiled will generally be available by the end of the first quarter 
 sam albert a consultant in <unk> n.y. said that in the past ibm has developed broad software strategies only for problems that crossed industry lines 
 he said he believes ibm 's decision to invest this sort of effort into a single industry showed that it was getting serious about understanding customers ' problems and was n't just selling technology 
 he said he expects ibm to unveil similar strategies for other industries in coming months 
 ibm 's push is also unusual in its approach to marketing 
 rather than just send out marketing people to knock on customers ' doors ibm is making several hundred of its own manufacturing people available to discuss specific needs 
 ibm 's manufacturing staff also will be able to provide software that ibm has developed <unk> and will be able to form teams with a customer to jointly solve manufacturing problems

 the tougher new regulations under the savings-and-loan bailout law are accelerating the thrift industry 's shrinking act 
 largely to meet tougher new capital requirements thrifts reduced their assets $ N billion in august by selling such assets as mortgage-backed securities and loans 
 industry assets as of aug. N were $ N trillion the lowest since august N 
 as thrifts sell assets to improve their <unk> ratio as required under the new law passed in august they must also reduce liabilities such as deposits 
 as interest rates paid <unk> were lowered thrift withdrawals exceeded deposits by $ N billion not including interest credited to accounts 
 it was the third consecutive month in which thrifts shed assets to increase the size of their capital in <unk> to their assets the office of thrift supervision said 
 the asset <unk> was particularly concentrated in several large california institutions 
 the <unk> of the thrift industry is well under way said <unk> <unk> an industry consultant in <unk> va 
 this suggests the bailout law is having a more dramatic effect than anyone would have <unk> so soon 
 james <unk> an economist with the office of thrift supervision also attributed some of the <unk> to seasonal factors 
 august is a month when people are paying school tuition he said 
 that and adjustment to the new law were the biggest factors in the industry 
 not including thrifts under government conservatorship s&ls reduced their assets by $ N billion from the previous month and deposit outflows totaled $ N billion 
 for the N insolvent thrifts under government management at the end of august assets declined by $ N billion and withdrawals exceeded deposits by $ N billion 
 thrifts raised capital mostly by selling mortgages and mortgage-backed securities which were reduced by $ N billion in august from the prior month 
 as of aug. N thrifts held $ N billion in mortgage-backed securities 
 the deposit numbers for august marked a swing back to huge outflows after a july net deposit <unk> of $ N million the only net <unk> in more than a year 
 deposits are n't expected to exceed withdrawals in the foreseeable future as the industry continues to shrink 
 i think we are going to see deposit <unk> continue unless we see big changes in rates mr. <unk> said 
 for the first eight months of N thrifts ' withdrawals exceeded deposits by $ N billion 
 for the prior year deposits exceeded withdrawals by $ N billion 
 the estimates of real gross national product prepared by the bureau of economic analysis in the department of commerce significantly <unk> the rate of economic growth 
 since the bureau 's estimates for the business sector provide the <unk> for the productivity ratios calculated by the department of labor underestimated growth rates artificially depress official productivity statistics 
 if this <unk> is correct it has important implications for <unk> policies it may lower the sense of urgency behind efforts to enact tax incentives and other measures to increase the rate of growth in productivity and real gnp 
 it would also affect the perceptions of the board of governors of the federal reserve system and the informed public generally as to what <unk> a reasonable degree of price stability 
 in the early 1980s i predicted a significant acceleration in productivity growth over the rest of the decade 
 this forecast was based on the apparent reversal of most of the negative forces such as <unk> changes the oil shock and accelerating inflation that had reduced productivity gains in the 1970s 
 there has indeed been more than a one percentage point improvement in productivity growth since N 
 but i had expected more which is one reason i began looking at evidence suggesting defects in the official output estimates 
 the evidence does not clearly support the view that the downward bias in output growth has become greater during the N period but all i am claiming is that the growth trend is <unk> 
 it is however possible that further study will reveal increasing bias 
 this bias is in no way <unk> 
 the <unk> of growth is due largely to the conservative <unk> adopted to deal with deficiencies in basic economic data 
 the first of three major sources of error is the use of labor input estimates mainly employment or hours instead of output estimates for those sectors such as governments paid household services and private <unk> institutions where there are difficulties in <unk> output data 
 this means that no allowance is made for possible increases in output per unit of labor 
 in an unrelated program in which the labor department does estimate output per employee for more than two-thirds of federal civilian employees it found an average annual rate of productivity improvement of N N during the 1980s 
 even if it is assumed that productivity rose no more than half as quickly in the rest of the <unk> sector this labor department estimate indicates a downward bias in the real gnp estimates of N percentage point a year on average 
 the federal productivity <unk> use labor input rather than output data for their calculations of half of private financial and service industries as well 
 independent estimates of output in those industries including one by the department of labor for banking suggests that productivity in finance and services appears to have risen by an average of at least N N a year between N and N 
 because finance and services contribute N N to final business product missing these productivity improvements <unk> the overall growth rate by N N a year 
 the second source of error in growth statistics is the use of inappropriate <unk> to adjust for price changes 
 i estimate that these <unk> as detailed by martin n. <unk> and robert j. gordon add a further N percentage point to the downward bias in the growth rate of real business product 
 finally the official estimates <unk> growth because they make inadequate allowance for improvements in quality of goods and services 
 in N a new price index for computers adjusted for changes in performance <unk> was introduced and that resulted in a significantly larger increase in real outlays for durable goods than the earlier estimates had showed 
 since then further research argues that failure to take account of quality improvements has contributed a total of at least N percentage point to the downward bias in the growth rate 
 in sum the <unk> <unk> above indicate a N percentage point <unk> in growth of total real gnp 
 for the private domestic business economy the bias was a bit over N percentage point 
 in other words the growth rates of both total gnp and real private business product per labor hour have been underestimated by about N N

 union carbide corp. said third-quarter net income plunged N N from a year earlier on weakness in the company 's mainstay chemicals and plastics business 
 net was $ N million or N cents a share for the quarter compared with $ N million or $ N a share a year ago 
 sales were $ N billion up N N from $ N billion the previous year 
 carbide like other companies with a heavy reliance on the so-called commodity end of the chemicals industry was expected to post earnings sharply lower than in an exceptionally strong N third quarter 
 but the company 's latest quarter was a few pennies a share lower than the more pessimistic projections on wall street 
 it certainly was n't a disaster but it does show weakness in some of the company 's chief markets said george <unk> a <unk> analyst at oppenheimer & co 
 in new york stock exchange composite trading carbide closed at $ N a share down N cents 
 prices for polyethylene a common plastic and an important carbide product started to fall early this year the slide accelerated in the third quarter as buyers continued to trim inventories 
 prices also fell for <unk> <unk> and <unk> products used in making <unk> 
 some producers of polyethylene figuring the inventory reductions are near an end have announced price boosts 
 the first real test of whether prices have hit bottom may come in the next several weeks when the new prices become effective 
 a carbide spokesman said the conditions are right for the increase to hold 
 for the third quarter operating profit from carbide 's chemicals and plastics business fell to $ N million from $ N million a year ago before accounting for taxes and interest expense 
 operating profit from carbon products such as <unk> <unk> also declined to $ N million from $ N million 
 in the <unk> segment operating profit climbed to $ N million from $ N million 
 the latest quarter included a gain of about $ N million on the sale of the company 's <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> businesses 
 <unk> <unk> are used in making <unk> products such as <unk> and <unk> <unk> are used in making the <unk> foam found in furniture <unk> and other products 
 that gain was mostly offset by a loss of about $ N million from a write-down in its <unk> business 
 <unk> is used in making integrated circuits

 at least N states are <unk> drexel burnham lambert inc. 's nationwide effort to settle its legal troubles and some might instead try to revoke the firm 's license to sell securities within their borders 
 the reluctance of some states to let drexel off the hook could <unk> the firm 's attempts to polish its image after its guilty plea to six <unk> last month say several people familiar with the discussions 
 up to now drexel has made a <unk> series of settlements with N states and the commonwealth of puerto rico 
 just yesterday new hampshire announced it made a $ N settlement with drexel a <unk> fine for a <unk> matter in that state 
 these states have been entering into settlements with drexel as part of the firm 's efforts to operate freely anywhere in the u.s. despite its record as an admitted <unk> 
 but individuals familiar with the generally successful drexel talks say the firm is meeting resistance from some big states including new jersey new york california pennsylvania connecticut and missouri 
 officials in some of these states say they do n't want to simply accept the settlements offered by drexel 
 they question if drexel is getting easier treatment than the many small <unk> firms whose brokerage licenses are routinely <unk> 
 drexel has to settle with state securities regulators in the wake of its criminal guilty plea and a related civil settlement with the securities and exchange commission that includes payment of $ N million in penalties 
 these stem from a two-year federal investigation of insider trading and securities fraud on wall street 
 ohio the district of columbia tennessee and illinois have been less <unk> to drexel than the other six states but nonetheless have refused to settle so far say those familiar with the discussions 
 drexel says it does n't expect any of its state brokerage licenses will be <unk> and even if some are its securities business would n't be directly hurt 
 it already has sold its retail or <unk> brokerage network securities firms do n't need brokerage licenses for <unk> activities such as investment banking 
 still if nothing else a <unk> brokerage license could be a burden because it must be disclosed in many of the transactions in which drexel could be involved 
 securities regulators <unk> drexel for its energetic effort led by <unk> general counsel saul s. cohen to settle its legal problems with the states 
 but they disagree about the message these settlements give to the public 
 there was a lot of internal debate about that specific issue said susan bryant oklahoma 's chief securities regulator and president of the north american securities administrators association which drafted a voluntary settlement plan for the states with drexel 
 the question she said is whether drexel should be allowed to pay and move on or whether you should simply revoke the license when someone is convicted of a felony 
 while ms. bryant 's state went ahead and accepted drexel 's settlement offer of $ N she said i do n't have any argument with those who came to different conclusions 
 i can see both sides 
 similarly alfred <unk> new hampshire 's director of securities regulation said his state had n't received any complaints about drexel so it really could n't press the issue 
 still i understand the reasons that other states are holding out he said 
 mr. cohen the drexel general counsel said i do n't think as we say in investment banking that by the end of the day we 'll be losing any licenses 
 asked about states that are taking a hard line he said there are states that have asked for additional information which we are providing to them 
 mr. cohen said more than $ N million has been paid to N states and that drexel still expects to pay out a total of $ N million 
 by the end of this week drexel should have another three to four settlements mr. cohen said 
 the rate we 're going i think that by the end of the month we 're looking to have a total of N to N he said 
 that total would be important for drexel 
 the investment bank has previously announced that as part of its punishment it would create an independent foundation to promote ethical behavior in the securities industry 
 a <unk> to that promise is that a minimum of N states reach settlement agreements before next tuesday 
 there are according to several securities commissioners at least N states that are either close to settlements with drexel or who do n't appear opposed to settling 
 drexel 's proposed state fines have been based on a state 's population and on the size of drexel 's business in the state 
 new jersey for example was asked to accept $ N but refused 
 the state is n't ruling out <unk> drexel 's brokerage license 
 the state can also bar drexel as an investment adviser 
 state officials wo n't describe their position in detail but james <unk> smith state securities chief said we really are still looking at it and have informed drexel that the proposal is really not sufficient for settlement 
 connecticut already has issued a notice of intent to revoke drexel 's brokerage license 
 it is one of the states that have met with mr. cohen and asked for additional information about investors ' accounts and other matters 
 this particular issue goes to the very integrity of the <unk> market state banking commissioner howard brown said 
 a banking department spokesman added commissioner brown does n't feel that money alone is the issue here 
 particularly touchy are the cases of new york which is drexel 's base and california the base of drexel 's highly profitable junk-bond operation that led to the firm 's legal difficulties 
 neither state has settled and officials in the two states wo n't discuss their reasons for not doing so 
 but drexel has made it clear it could mount a significant legal battle in each state if its license is <unk> according to state officials 
 ms. bryant the head of the state securities group said drexel has done a better job of settling with the states than <unk> hutton did after its guilty plea to a massive <unk> scheme several years ago 
 still she said drexel 's trouble with some states is n't a bad thing 
 this process should point out that it 's not going to be easy for a firm that 's convicted of a felony to immediately jump back into the retail business ms. bryant said 
 we need to have somebody worried so they do n't do this again 
 these are the N states including the commonwealth of puerto rico that have settled with drexel alaska arkansas delaware georgia hawaii idaho indiana iowa kansas kentucky maine maryland minnesota mississippi new hampshire new mexico north <unk> oklahoma oregon south carolina south <unk> utah vermont washington wyoming and puerto rico 
 time warner inc. reported a third-quarter net loss of $ N million or $ N cents a share reflecting acquisition costs for a N N stake in warner communications inc. and the purchase method of accounting for the transaction 
 separately warner reported a net loss of $ N million or N cents a share including merger expenses of $ N million and $ N million in charges associated with <unk> compensation plans 
 time warner is in the process of completing its acquisition of the remaining warner shares 
 time warner emphasized in a news release that it should be <unk> based on its cash flow which the company defined as earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization 
 on a <unk> basis assuming the merger was effective jan N N including the results from both time inc. and all of warner that cash flow figure would be $ N million for the latest quarter more than double the comparable figure a year ago or $ N million according to time warner

 what really matters is the operating income of the divisions i look at these numbers and i say these businesses are doing well said mark <unk> a vice president of donaldson lufkin & jenrette securities corp 
 for example warner made more than $ N million from <unk> entertainment in three months 
 that 's a big number 
 warner also had a gain of more than N N from records and music publishing even though the domestic record business was sluggish this summer

 combined revenue for the latest quarter of time warner was $ N billion compared with the year-ago time revenue of $ N billion

 on the other hand time warner said its operating cash flow declined in the quarter for its magazine division its books division and the home box office programming division 
 in magazines higher advertising revenues at sports illustrated and fortune were offset by lower ad revenue for other major magazines 
 the programming division saw a decline in operating cash flow because the year-ago quarter included a $ N million dividend from turner broadcasting system and because the quarter includes expenses associated with the nov. N launch of hbo 's comedy channel

 <unk> recently emerged from bankruptcy-law proceedings that left N N of the <unk> company 's common stock in the hands of <unk> of an <unk> claims trust 
 the company said it would have no further comment 
 mr. <unk> N was elected chairman earlier this year by the company 's new board having served as vice president for legal and corporate affairs 
 his father david s. <unk> was chairman and chief executive until his death in an accident five years ago at which time mr. penn was named president 
 some house democrats are trying to head off an appointment by president bush to the board that oversees the savings-and-loan bailout <unk> that the prospective <unk> is the head of troubled banks himself 
 four democrats on the house banking committee sent president bush a letter <unk> their concerns about the expected appointment of james simmons an arizona banker and former <unk> for mr. bush to the oversight board of the resolution trust corp 
 the oversight board created in the savings-and-loan law signed in august sets policy for the rtc which will sell hundreds of the nation 's sick thrifts and billions of dollars of their assets 
 treasury secretary nicholas brady federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan and housing and urban development secretary jack kemp are members of the board 
 president bush must <unk> two other members one a democrat and one a republican 
 an administration official confirmed last week that mr. simmons the chairman of valley national bank in phoenix is the republican <unk> and that a security clearance was under way 
 the democratic <unk> has n't been determined the official said 
 mr. simmons declined to comment and the white house said the congressmen 's letter is under review 
 the letter dated last thursday cited the losses at valley national and at united bank also of phoenix where mr. simmons was chairman for N years 
 both banks have been battered as have other arizona banks by falling real estate prices 
 valley national for example had $ N million in problem assets as of june 
 we believe that there are numerous other candidates more qualified for this important position and we encourage you to give them your <unk> consideration before making this key rtc appointment the letter said 
 the rtc needs the most able competent management available 
 but mr. simmons has long ties to both republicans and banking 
 he was <unk> of mr. bush 's arizona campaign committee in last year 's election and also worked for mr. bush in the N election 
 the two met more than N years ago when mr. simmons worked for commercial bank & trust co. of midland texas where mr. bush was an organizing director 
 in N mr. simmons also served on a committee of businessmen headed by william seidman chairman of the federal deposit insurance corp. and the resolution trust corp 
 that committee determined to open arizona to banking across state lines 
 arizona trend magazine referred to mr. simmons this year as one of the N most influential people in the state 
 the letter to mr. bush was signed by <unk> bruce <unk> d. minn. the chairman of the banking committee 's rtc task force thomas <unk> d. md. <unk> <unk> d. md and paul <unk> d. pa 
 <unk> w. <unk> a vice chairman of this bank-holding company was named to the additional position of chairman of its principal unit <unk> bank 
 mr. <unk> N years old will remain president and chief executive officer of the unit 
 <unk> also named john b. werner a vice chairman of the parent company and the unit and elected him to the newly created position of chief credit officer of <unk> financial increasing the number of corporate board members to N 
 mr. werner N was formerly senior executive vice president of the parent company and the unit 
 moody 's investors service inc. said it lowered the debt ratings of certain long-term debt held by this company 
 the <unk> concern cited the bank 's move into the texas market noting its profitability and capital <unk> measurements will be depressed relative to the bank 's past performance 
 moody 's also said it raised its rating on the deposit insurance bridge bank now known as bank one texas <unk> reflecting the support of other banking affiliates and substantial assistance for the fdic 
 officials at the new york bank-holding company were n't available for comment on the <unk> changes 
 at lloyd 's of london underwriters still <unk> out policies using <unk> <unk> and <unk> paper 
 visitors are <unk> into the premises by <unk> <unk> known as <unk> a reminder of the insurance market 's <unk> in a <unk> in <unk> century london 
 such <unk> suggest a <unk> past but give no hint of a troubled present 
 lloyd 's once a <unk> of the world insurance market is being shaken to its very foundation 
 the <unk> exchange is battered by enormous claims from a <unk> run of unprecedented disasters the most recent of which is last week 's earthquake in california 's bay area 
 at the same time lloyd 's is besieged by <unk> investors and <unk> by inefficient but <unk> ways of conducting business 
 the exchange is gradually being squeezed into narrow <unk> segments of the market by less <unk> competitors 
 lloyd 's is on the ropes says peter <unk> a lloyd 's investor for N years who now leads a dissident group threatening to sue exchange underwriters for alleged <unk> and negligence 
 it needs more discipline 
 it needs to sort itself out 
 most troublesome is the shrinking pool of names the <unk> investors some of them royal who as members of about N syndicates underwrite policies 
 some N members quit the exchange last year more than triple the number of resignations in N 
 names are resigning at an even faster pace this year 
 lackluster returns are one reason 
 the average after-tax return on investment in N the most recent year for which results are available was N N according to <unk> ltd. an insurance consulting firm in london 
 in N it was N N 
 between N and N the most recent five-year period for which figures are available lloyd 's reported over # N billion in claims and reserves against future losses $ N billion at today 's exchange rates more than double the # N billion posted in the previous five-year period 
 many of the N investors who remain are beginning to question one of the exchange 's most basic <unk> the concept of <unk> personal liability 
 investors may reap huge profits when premiums exceed claims but they are liable to their last pound or dollar in the event of a catastrophe 
 and catastrophes are getting ever more costly 
 lloyd 's claims for the N <unk> <unk> <unk> disaster in the north sea for instance may reach $ N billion 
 during the five-year period ended N roughly N N of the names had money tied up in money-losing syndicates according to <unk> consultants 
 the <unk> of <unk> liability looms large for a number of them now 
 i have <unk> i could die and be out of it that 's how bad it is <unk> <unk> a secretary from suburban london says 
 ms. <unk> whose lloyd 's membership was a bonus from a former employer in N belongs to mr. <unk> 's dissident group on the <unk> syndicate which has been hard hit by asbestos reinsurance claims 
 ms. <unk> who <unk> # N or about $ N of insurance coverage on that syndicate now faces potential losses of roughly # N or $ N 
 if lloyd 's wants # N out of me they will have to take everything i 've got and even then i do n't know if it will be enough she says 
 <unk> is widespread among exchange members 
 i ca n't think of any reason to join lloyd 's now says keith whitten a british businessman and a lloyd 's member since N 
 the downside is very considerable and at the moment the upside is very marginal 
 if profits do n't improve mr. whitten says he may quit the exchange 
 meanwhile competition from rivals <unk> by history is <unk> 
 lloyd 's is being squeezed out of <unk> but more consistently profitable product lines such as primary property and marine insurance 
 over the past decade competitors have <unk> away at the exchange 's share of the # N billion marine market in london where half the world 's ships are insured 
 lloyd 's N N stake in that market has <unk> to N N in that period according to an official at the institute of london underwriters a lloyd 's competitor 
 the official asked not to be named 
 much of the business has gone to the institute an association of more than N insurers including cigna corp. allianz <unk> ag of west germany and britain 's commercial union assurance plc 
 lloyd 's has <unk> decades of <unk> decline 
 at the peak of its power and influence a century ago lloyd 's dominated the insurance world with a N N stake 
 it virtually <unk> how ships were to be built and it monitored commerce through a <unk> intelligence network in ports around the globe 
 today lloyd 's share of the world market excluding life insurance is about N N 
 its stake is even smaller if life insurance is included 
 bigger rivals such as aetna and allianz backed by <unk> of <unk> using computers in hundreds of branches operate more efficiently and often can offer lower rates brokers say 
 though lloyd 's <unk> such <unk> policies as worker 's compensation insurance <unk> insurance for homeowners and businesses and bankers ' liability insurance competitors now underwrite most of that business 
 beyond that many big oil chemical and airline companies are <unk> off big chunks of the market by <unk> themselves through <unk> offshore companies for <unk> coverage 
 even lloyd 's specialty unusually risky ventures is being challenged 
 only N years ago for instance lloyd 's was the <unk> insurer of thoroughbred horses 
 but since N kirk horse insurance inc. of lexington ky. has grabbed a N N stake of the market 
 ronald kirk president says lloyd 's has suffered because its structure does n't allow underwriters to deal directly with clients brokers are required <unk> 
 thus he asserts lloyd 's ca n't react quickly to competition 
 lloyd 's has lost control of the situation he says 
 they are n't controlling their <unk> like they used to 
 murray lawrence lloyd 's chairman agrees the exchange faces big challenges 
 this is a <unk> time and we are trying to plot our way ahead he says 
 we have been a great market for <unk> risks which other people then take copy and cut rates 
 lloyd 's he says is cut off from the vast body of premium down at the bottom end which acts as a <unk> influence against catastrophic losses 
 by that he means <unk> but <unk> products such as certain types of primary property insurance 
 the exchange he says must find new products and new markets 
 that wo n't be an easy task 
 tradition is dictator at lloyd 's 
 three years ago the exchange took up residence in a <unk> tower of steel and glass <unk> of the kind of modern architecture that britain 's prince charles has denounced 
 some exchange <unk> call the building the oil rig 
 but along with such <unk> <unk> as lord nelson 's <unk> lloyd 's also brought its <unk> ways of doing business 
 the lloyd 's market actively <unk> insurance just N N hours a day brokers say 
 underwriting does n't get under way until after morning tea at N a.m 
 a <unk> lunch break follows 
 things wind down at about N p.m. just in time for afternoon tea 
 lloyd 's vast trading hall houses a warren of <unk> desks 
 the hall 's few computers are used mostly to send messages 
 <unk> between desks underwriters sit on <unk> surrounded by <unk> of policies 
 brokers <unk> thick <unk> stand in lines waiting their turn to speak to the underwriters 
 a broker may have to approach as many as N underwriters who insure the <unk> on behalf of the syndicates 
 it could take six months for a claim to be paid 
 the system says nicholas <unk> a lloyd 's broker who left the exchange in N is so <unk> <unk> it drives you mad 
 some maintain underwriters also have been <unk> 
 john <unk> a lloyd 's underwriter says he and his fellow underwriters underestimated by as much as N N the premiums they should have charged for property risks from N to N 
 how <unk> we must have appeared to the outside world how incompetent at risk assessment and evaluation he says 
 lloyd 's officials decline to comment on the matter 
 more recently property rates have increased 
 many at lloyd 's expect the san francisco earthquake will cause the industry to boost rates even further 
 but it will be years before it is clear whether higher rates will offset the payouts for such disasters 
 the magnitude of the exchange 's problems may not become known for some time because of lloyd 's practice of leaving the books open for three years to allow for the settlement of claims 
 lloyd 's only recently reported its financial results for N 
 that year it posted record pretax profit of # N million a gain it attributes to higher rates and fewer claims 
 but mr. lawrence says reported profit will be down in N N and N though he declines to specify how steep the decline will be 
 insurance analysts say the exchange 's downturn in profitability is likely to be <unk> by more than $ N million in aviation losses including the N pan am airline disaster over <unk> scotland and a <unk> chunk of claims from september 's hurricane hugo 
 lloyd 's says the departures of names is n't likely to hurt its underwriting capacity currently about # N billion 
 mr. lawrence says the drain of funds has been offset by an increase in investments by the remaining names 
 meanwhile the exchange has been trying to lower costs 
 it recently cut its work force by N N or N 
 but lloyd 's is hampered in its efforts to overhaul operations by its reluctance to <unk> modern technology 
 mr. <unk> the underwriter <unk> half of his business could be <unk> by computer cutting costs at least N N 
 though lloyd 's has talked for years about <unk> underwriting transactions the effort has n't gotten very far 
 competition among underwriters and brokers makes them loath to <unk> price and policy information 
 both groups <unk> to traditional face-to-face dealings even for routine policies 
 lloyd 's <unk> bureaucracy also <unk> efforts to update marketing strategies 
 some underwriters have been pressing for years to tap the <unk> business by selling some policies directly to consumers 
 lloyd 's <unk> sells only auto insurance directly to the public and such policies are sold only in limited markets such as the u.k. and canada 
 but such changes must be cleared by four internal committees and dozens of underwriters brokers and administrators before being implemented 
 the proposal to sell directly to the public remains mired in bureaucratic <unk> 
 lloyd 's is moving forward on some fronts though 
 mr. lawrence says the exchange is <unk> some procedures to make <unk> payments on claims 
 by next year all underwriters will be linked to a communications network that could reduce paper work on claims 
 japan 's daiwa securities co. named <unk> dozen president 
 mr. dozen succeeds <unk> <unk> who will become vice chairman 
 <unk> <unk> retains his title of chairman of daiwa japan 's second-largest securities firm 
 in japanese firms the president usually is in charge of day-to-day operations while the chairman 's role is more a <unk> one 
 the title of chief executive officer is n't used 
 while people within daiwa particularly <unk> expected that mr. dozen N would eventually become daiwa 's president the speed of his promotion surprised many 
 it was only earlier this year that the <unk> <unk> executive he likes to joke with americans about how his name is <unk> with twelve was appointed deputy president 
 mr. dozen is taking over the reins of a securities company that does very well in its domestic market but that is still seeking to realize its potential in global investment banking and securities dealing 
 daiwa is one of the world 's largest securities firms 
 as of march N the daiwa group had shareholder equity of N billion yen $ N billion 
 for the six months ended sept. N daiwa reported unconsolidated parent company net income of N billion yen $ N million on revenue of N billion yen $ N billion 
 both figures were record highs 
 several observers interpreted mr. dozen 's appointment as an attempt by daiwa to make its international operations more profitable while preparing the firm for the effects of the continuing deregulation of japan 's domestic markets which should mean increased competition 
 all of japan 's so-called big four securities firms nomura securities co. ltd. the world 's largest nikko securities co. ltd. yamaichi securities co. ltd. and daiwa have suffered setbacks in their attempts to break into foreign markets 
 while they have moved to the <unk> in underwriting fixed-income securities in the <unk> market mostly for japanese firms they have been only marginally profitable if at all in the u.s. 
 american institutional investors have never had a large appetite for japanese equities 
 and while the japanese have stepped up their purchases of u.s. shares in the past several months they have shown themselves in the past to be <unk> investors 
 at the same time daiwa and its <unk> have faced stiff competition from <unk> american competitors that have prevented them from building strong links to u.s. corporations and institutional investors 
 mr. dozen knows these problems <unk> 
 when he arrived in the u.s. in N the start of an <unk> tour he tried selling japanese <unk> bonds to u.s. investors 
 he made desperate efforts using the yellow pages from beginning to end said <unk> <unk> president of daiwa 's u.s. unit 
 but not a single piece of paper was sold 
 by his own account mr. dozen did n't do much better with u.s. bonds 
 in an interview a few months ago he recalled how after some training at salomon brothers inc. he successfully bid for the opportunity to sell portions of N u.s. corporate bond issues 
 but he could n't sell any 
 japanese stock salesmen selling american bonds 
 maybe it 's crazy he said 
 mr. dozen even related the <unk> suffered when he and two colleagues went on an overnight fishing <unk> off the new jersey shore and caught nothing 
 upon returning to new york exhausted i got into a <unk> and the woman driver said americans make better <unk> he recalled 
 <unk> mr. dozen said that daiwa 's goal is to build a high-technology <unk> international organization with maybe some japanese flavor to it 
 he said that he was particularly interested in his firm gaining expertise in futures options <unk> securities computerized trading and investment systems as well as mergers and acquisitions 
 mr. dozen said daiwa 's strengths were its large capital base its influential position in the tokyo market and its links to japanese corporations and institutional investors 
 mr. dozen joined daiwa upon his <unk> from <unk> university in N 
 like many young <unk> in japanese securities firms he began his career peddling stock to individual investors 
 in his climb to the top mr. dozen also headed the company 's <unk> division its fixed-income units and its international operations 
 he was constantly picking up new things to fill out his experience he is very <unk> said <unk> <unk> chairman of daiwa 's u.s. unit in new york 
 but it mr. dozen 's experience as a salesman that enabled him to gain the political support particularly from the retail sales force to <unk> to the presidency 
 commission income from domestic stock and bond sales accounts form a large portion of japanese securities companies ' earnings 
 and anybody who lacked the backing of the retail sales force would be fragile said a daiwa executive 
 if mr. dozen has a weakness it may be his golf game 
 he digs in the sand instead of hitting the ball like a farmer said mr. <unk> 
 inco ltd. posted a N N decline in third-quarter net income a performance that was in line with analysts ' expectations 
 the nickel producer also raised its quarterly dividend to N cents a share from N cents and said it may buy back as much as N N of its common outstanding 
 inco shares fell after the announcements 
 analysts said some investors were disappointed that the <unk> company had failed to announce a special dividend 
 inco closed at $ N a share down N cents in new york stock exchange composite trading 
 some analysts said inco which had cash reserves of $ N million as of sept. N could still announce a special dividend in the next few months though it would be smaller than the $ <unk> special dividend it paid last year 
 the quarterly dividend is payable dec. N to shares of record nov. N 
 inco 's net fell to $ N million or $ N a share in the third quarter from $ N million or $ N a share a year earlier 
 sales rose N N to $ N million from $ N million 
 excluding special gains from tax-loss <unk> earnings in the latest quarter were $ N million or $ N a share compared with $ N million or $ N a share 
 inco said the drop in earnings resulted mainly from lower nickel prices for the period and a temporary cut in nickel output at the company 's manitoba operations due to high levels of <unk> in the <unk> 
 inco said it plans to buy back as many as five million common shares over the next N months if nickel market conditions are favorable 
 under a previous <unk> program inco has purchased N million of its shares since april 
 ual corp. 's board <unk> any prospects for an immediate revival of a labor-management buy-out saying united airlines ' parent should remain independent for now 
 as a result ual 's chairman stephen m. wolf pulled out of the buy-out effort to focus on running the company 
 the two developments put the acquisition attempt back to square one and leaves the airline with an array of <unk> matters including an unsettled labor situation and a management scrambling to restore its damaged credibility 
 the effort to create the nation 's largest <unk> company began <unk> oct. N when the labor-management group was unable to obtain financing for its $ 300-a-share $ N billion offer 
 just last week it suffered another major setback when british airways plc the largest equity investor in the labor-management bid withdrew its support 
 takeover stock traders focusing on the company 's intention to stay independent took the announcement as bad news 
 ual which had risen $ N to $ N in composite trading on the new york stock exchange on reports of a new bid being prepared by the group reversed course and plummeted in <unk> trading after the N p.m. edt announcement 
 among the first trades reported by the securities firm of jefferies & co. which makes a market in ual after the exchange is closed were N shares at $ N N shares at $ N N at $ N and N at $ N 
 the rebound in ual stock during regular trading hours monday was its first daily gain after six consecutive losses left the price N N below its level before oct. N the day the group announced the bank financing could n't be obtained for the original deal 
 twelve of ual 's outside directors met at a <unk> meeting yesterday in chicago to consider an informal proposal from the buy-out group for a revised bid 
 but the board said it was n't interested for now 
 that proposal valued at between $ N and $ N a share would have transferred majority ownership to employees while leaving some stock in public hands 
 the buy-out group had no firm financing for the plan 
 and with no other offers on the table the board apparently felt no pressure to act on it 
 the directors signaled however that they would be willing to consider future offers or take some other action to maximize shareholder value saying they would continue to explore all strategic and financial alternatives 
 but it was clear that for the time being the board wants the company to return to <unk> 
 the board said it concluded that the welfare of the company its shareholders its employees and the broader public can best be enhanced by continued development of ual as a strong viable independent company 
 mr. wolf urged all employees to now turn their full attention to operating the airline 
 he also vowed to make every effort to <unk> a <unk> new relationship that has been <unk> with participating employee groups 
 but mr. wolf faces a <unk> task in pulling the company back together again 
 labor problems top the list 
 for a brief time the buy-out effort seemed to solve his problems with united 's pilot union 
 in return for an ownership stake in the company the pilots were willing to agree to a seven-year contract that included a <unk> clause and significant wage concessions and productivity gains the union previously resisted 
 that contract was tied to the success of the buy-out 
 as a <unk> measure the pilots had been working four extra hours a month and had agreed to fly ual 's two new boeing N aircraft 
 it 's uncertain if the pilots will continue to do so without a contract settlement 
 the union said late last night that it is still committed to majority employee ownership and that the labor disputes that faced the company prior to the buy-out effort still need to be addressed 
 the buy-out effort also <unk> <unk> relations between united 's pilot and <unk> unions 
 the machinists ' criticisms of the labor-management bid and their threats of a strike unless they received substantial wage increases this year helped cool banks ' interest in financing the transaction 
 the machinists previously had shown themselves to be an ally to mr. wolf but he lost much of his credibility with that group when he <unk> up with the pilot union 
 the machinists criticized the terms mr. wolf and management received in the buy-out 
 they paid $ N million for a N N stake and received an additional N N of the company at no additional cost 
 his credibility is also on the line in the investment community 
 until the collapse of this bid mr. wolf was regarded as one of the nation 's <unk> airline executives after engineering <unk> of tiger international inc. and republic airlines 
 but he and his chief financial officer john pope <unk> some of the seeds for the deal 's failure by insisting banks accept low financing fees and interest rates while they invested in the transaction only a small fraction of the $ N million they stood to gain from sale of their ual stock and options 
 the board 's actions leave takeover stock traders nursing some $ N million in losses and eager to respond to anyone who might make a new offer 
 it also inevitably leaves a <unk> of shareholder lawsuits 
 arbitragers said they were disappointed the company did n't announce some recapitalization or other plan to maximize value 
 one takeover expert noted that arbitragers could force a recapitalization through the written consent process under which holders may oust the board by a majority vote 
 the machinists union has suggested it may propose a recapitalization that includes a special dividend for holders and a minority ownership stake for employees 
 los angeles investor marvin davis whose $ <unk> offer for ual in august triggered a bidding war says he remains interested in the airline 
 however he is restricted from making certain hostile moves by an agreement he signed to obtain confidential ual data 
 essentially he ca n't make any hostile moves unless he makes a tender offer at least $ N a share 
 tandy corp. said it wo n't join u.s. memories the group that seeks to battle the japanese in the market for computer memory chips 
 tandy 's decision is a second setback for u.s. memories 
 last month apple computer inc. said that it would n't invest in the group 
 apple said that its money would be better spent in areas such as research and development 
 u.s. memories is seeking major investors to back its attempt to crack the $ N billion market for dynamic random access memory chips a market dominated by the japanese 
 those chips were in dire shortage last year hurting many u.s. computer companies that could n't get sufficient <unk> chips 
 tandy said its experience during the shortage did n't merit the $ N million to $ N million investment u.s. memories is seeking from each investor 
 at this time we elected not to get involved because we have been able to satisfy our need for <unk> from the market as a rule said ed <unk> tandy 's director of market planning 
 sanford kane u.s. memories president said the decision was disappointing but does n't <unk> u.s. memories ' failure 
 i would like to have had them he said 
 but they were n't on my list of companies who were critical to be a part of it 
 mr. kane became president and chief executive officer of u.s. memories last june when the group was formed by seven electronics companies advanced micro devices inc. digital equipment corp. hewlett-packard co. intel corp. international business machines corp. lsi logic corp. and national semiconductor corp 
 mr. kane said he expects two or three major corporations to announce their participation in u.s. memories soon after the group <unk> a business plan probably late this week 
 u.s. memories needs a catalyst he said to <unk> others to join 
 but so far most potential participants have n't decided 
 sun microsystems inc. said it 's still actively evaluating u.s. memories and plans to meet with u.s. memories representatives later this week 
 american telephone & telegraph co. said it was waiting to see u.s. memories ' business plan 
 personal-computer maker <unk> research inc. said it is still studying the situation 
 a compaq computer corp. spokeswoman said that the company has n't made a decision yet although it is n't under active consideration 
 in a startling <unk> members of the senate intelligence committee are complaining that someone in the executive branch is <unk> on them 
 david boren the intelligence committee chairman is upset that someone <unk> a letter to the committee from the reagan administration suggesting that the u.s. would <unk> to warn panamanian <unk> manuel noriega if it got wind of an impending coup that might result in his assassination 
 with due respect to highly classified <unk> and other <unk> the <unk> are performing a public service 
 if the cia has become a protection service for mr. noriega the american people ought to know 
 what went wrong in panama is a <unk> subject for public and congressional inquiry 
 naturally senator boren and his committee would like free rein to blame the executive branch while <unk> top secret on their own <unk> 
 but there 's no danger of <unk> sources and methods in disclosing the debate running up and down pennsylvania avenue 
 and if congress is going to assume authority to <unk> foreign policy it 's going to have to take some of the responsibility too 
 the president of the united states urged the panamanian armed forces to move against mr. noriega 
 when they did his <unk> did n't have the initiative to do more than block a couple of roads 
 the executive branch bears the first responsibility for <unk> 
 but what kind of initiative can you expect given the climate set by congress 
 for example what exactly did the cia tell major <unk> and his fellow coup <unk> about u.s. laws and executive orders on assassinations 
 what part did u.s. warnings play in the major 's <unk> to pull the trigger when he had general noriega in custody but was under attack by <unk> troops 
 mr. noriega did n't suffer from any <unk> once he had the <unk> 
 maybe we need a cia version of the <unk> warning you have the right to <unk> your coup intentions because we may <unk> on you 
 or maybe a surgeon general 's warning <unk> in the united states may be fatal 
 cia chief william webster hardly a washington <unk> got the debate started last week by noting that the executive order banning assassinations had contributed to u.s. <unk> during the coup 
 the cia 's deputy director of operations richard <unk> tried to smooth things over a few days later but instead simply <unk> mr. webster 's point 
 the interpretation of the executive order mr. <unk> said and the way in which the various committees have over time interpreted it has led in my view to a proper caution on the part of operators including me 
 in other words congress wo n't let the cia do much of anything anymore and that 's fine with the cia 
 the pay 's the same and the duty 's lighter 
 and of course doing anything that might be <unk> by congress carries heavy penalties 
 witness the <unk> prosecution of <unk> north 
 the intelligence committee 's ranking republican senator william cohen joined with senator george mitchell to write a best seller about iran-contra <unk> men of <unk> 
 no doubt many people in the cia the pentagon and the national security council have read it 
 what kind of initiative should anyone expect from people out on the line who 've read all this and know what can happen if they fail 
 who wants to end up as the <unk> in a bill cohen <unk> play 
 the order against assassinations is another <unk> of the same congressional <unk> a product of the 1970s vietnam syndrome against any executive action 
 president bush would do himself and the country a favor by <unk> the order as an <unk> <unk> on his ability to defend america 's national security 
 there are of course good reasons the u.s. should n't get into the assassination business but <unk> the executive order is not the same thing as saying the u.s. should start passing out <unk> <unk> 
 the world being the nasty place it is we want presidents to have the freedom to order operations in which someone might get killed 
 in such situations you can not write rules in advance you can only make sure the president takes the responsibility 
 the executive order and the reported agreements with the intelligence committee are neither <unk> nor moral 
 as it now stands the u.s. can bomb <unk> but ca n't <unk> <unk> <unk> 
 it can send a fighter <unk> to <unk> terrorist <unk> in the <unk> valley but ca n't shoot <unk> <unk> 
 both the assassination order and the quality of debate in washington are telling the world that the only way the u.s. will kill a <unk> is by making sure we take some innocent <unk> with him 
 we 've heard california 's <unk> proposition N blamed for a lot over the years but abc 's ted <unk> came up with a new <unk> in his earthquake coverage last week when he asked democratic <unk> richard katz if <unk> N had withheld money needed for road maintenance 
 mr. katz <unk> agreed sliding over the fact that california 's roads and bridges are n't funded by property taxes but by state and federal gasoline taxes 
 both have been raised at least N N in recent years even while the price of gasoline has fallen 
 dragging <unk> N into this story is a pretty long stretch 
 a series of explosions <unk> through the huge phillips petroleum co. plastics plant near here <unk> more than a hundred and closing parts of the houston ship channel 
 there were no immediate reports of deaths but officials said a number of workers were still <unk> for last night 
 the <unk> okla. oil company late yesterday still had n't said officially what caused the explosions and fires which sent columns of heavy black smoke <unk> high into the air 
 one local phillips manager said a seal <unk> in one of the plant 's <unk> 
 glenn cox phillips ' president and chief operating officer and other phillips officials flew from <unk> to assess the damage and determine the cause of the afternoon explosions 
 in composite trading on the new york stock exchange phillips petroleum shares fell $ N to $ N 
 the plastics plant is located on an <unk> <unk> in the heart of the petrochemical <unk> that reaches along the u.s. gulf coast 
 the u.s. coast guard closed six miles of the houston ship channel where about N companies have operations because the thick black smoke <unk> the area

 as part of the agreement goodson also terminated the contract under which ingersoll manages goodson 's N newspapers ending a long association between the two companies that has turned increasingly bitter recently 
 goodson has accused ingersoll of paying less attention to its properties and more to such ventures as the recent launch of the st. louis sun 
 under the terms of the accord ingersoll will pay about $ N million for the register a daily that goodson bought for about $ N million in N 
 goodson will pay the additional $ N million in settlement of the management contract 
 goodson also announced that it hired the former president and senior vice president of ingersoll to run the goodson papers 
 both executives left the company after <unk> with chairman ralph ingersoll jr 
 goodson which is based here will use part of the proceeds to pay down debt associated with its purchase of the morristown daily record for $ N million in N 
 the new jersey paper like the new haven conn. paper was purchased by ingersoll on goodson 's behalf as part of the management contract 
 industry analysts have said that the purchase price for the paper was too high causing a strain on goodson 's finances 
 investment bankers familiar with the company said goodson is seeking a new bank credit line of $ N million and may have to sell additional newspapers 
 david n. <unk> president and chief operating officer of goodson said in a telephone interview that the company does n't currently have any plans to sell additional newspapers 
 goodson said david carr former president of ingersoll publications and ray <unk> former senior vice president would head the new in-house management team at goodson which had revenue of $ N million in N 
 the association between the two companies <unk> back <unk> years to a friendship between television producer mark goodson and ingersoll founder ralph ingersoll 
 the latter 's son ralph ingersoll jr. took over the company and has been managing the goodson properties and acting as an agent in the purchase of newspapers for goodson 
 but in recent years mr. ingersoll began focusing more on expanding his own newspaper empire in partnership with investment banking firm warburg <unk> & co 
 ingersoll has N <unk> and N other <unk> papers in the u.s. and europe 
 the company said its revenue will exceed $ N million this year 
 ingersoll president robert m. <unk> said in a statement that the company is <unk> by the conclusion of the goodson relationship and will be able to concentrate all our <unk> on ingersoll 's own papers

 just five months after ogilvy group was <unk> up in an unsolicited takeover kenneth roman ogilvy 's chairman and chief executive officer said he is leaving to take a top post at american express co 
 mr. roman N years old abruptly announced he will leave the venerable ad agency whose largest client is american express to become american express 's executive vice president for corporate affairs and communications 
 he will succeed harry l. freeman N who has said he will retire in december 
 mr. freeman said in august that he would retire by the end of this year to take executive responsibility for an embarrassing effort to <unk> banker <unk> <unk> 
 american express representatives apparently influenced the publication of unfavorable articles about mr. <unk> 
 the company later <unk> and agreed to make $ N million in contributions to charities chosen by him 
 although mr. freeman is retiring he will continue to work as a consultant for american express on a project basis 
 ad industry executives were n't surprised by mr. roman 's decision to leave ogilvy 
 the agency under his direction bitterly fought a takeover attempt by wpp group plc of london before <unk> in may 
 and although mr. roman and wpp 's chief executive martin sorrell have gone out of their way to be publicly supportive of each other people close to mr. roman say he was unhappy giving up control of the company 
 some executives also cite tension because of efforts by mr. sorrell a financial man to cut costs at the agency 
 mr. roman will be succeeded as the head of ogilvy 's flagship ad agency ogilvy & mather worldwide by graham phillips N who had been president of north american operations and who like mr. sorrell is british 
 alexander <unk> N will take on the newly created position of president of the world-wide agency and chief executive of its international operations 
 he had been president of the international operations 
 mr. roman also had <unk> ogilvy group 's two other units the <unk> <unk> <unk> advertising agency and its research division but those units will now report directly to wpp 
 mr. roman appears <unk> for the american express job 
 known as a traditional executive he is very much in the conservative american express <unk> 
 moreover after N years at ogilvy he had <unk> a reputation for being <unk> and a straight arrow which can only help american express in the wake of the <unk> incident 
 he also is close to american express 's chairman and chief executive officer james d. robinson iii 
 aside from working with mr. robinson on the american express advertising account for about N years mr. roman serves on several of the same charities and boards as mr. robinson 
 the abrupt management change sparked widespread speculation that mr. roman had been pushed out of ogilvy 's top spot by mr. sorrell 
 but mr. roman <unk> denied the speculation saying mr. sorrell had tried several times to persuade him to stay offering various incentives and in one instance sending a note with a case of wine the wine naturally was seagram 's brand an ogilvy client 
 he asked me not to resign 
 the implication that i was pushed aside would n't be accurate mr. roman said 
 mr. sorrell traveling in the far east could n't be reached 
 mr. roman said american express 's mr. robinson first approached him about the job in late september 
 according to industry executives peter <unk> a former european community commissioner from ireland was also a serious <unk> for the american express job 
 although it ultimately was n't offered to him he will be on <unk> to american express as an adviser on international matters 
 after talking on and off for the past four weeks mr. roman said he agreed to take the job because it 's the right time it 's a <unk> opportunity and i think i leave the company in very strong hands 
 it was my decision not anyone else 's 
 mr. roman also brushed aside reports about <unk> between him and mr. phillips his successor at ogilvy 
 the two executives could hardly be more different 
 mr. roman comes across as a <unk> executive mr. phillips has a <unk> <unk> 
 during time off mr. roman tends to his garden mr. phillips <unk> to a <unk> for among other things fast cars and planes 
 industry executives say that although the two executives used to clash more frequently the wpp takeover brought them closer together 
 i 'm the guy who made him head of new york head of the u.s. president of north america and recommended him to mr. sorrell as my successor 
 would i have done all those things <unk> if i did n't think he was the right guy mr. roman asked 
 he labeled reports of <unk> ridiculous and said that he spent part of the weekend on mr. phillips 's boat in connecticut 
 mr. roman will oversee american express 's public relations and government affairs among other things but he wo n't be involved in its advertising which is handled by the operating units 
 i consider this a second career he said 
 he also will sit on the company 's corporate planning and policy committee made up of the top corporate and operating executives 
 mr. roman 's departure is n't expected to have any enormous <unk> at ogilvy 
 american express kraft general foods and mattel executives said the move wo n't affect their relationships with the ad agency 
 general foods 's relationships with its agencies are based on the agencies ' work and will continue to be said david <unk> a vice president of kraft general foods 
 but some clients and analysts expressed concern that mr. phillips is n't as well-known to many clients 
 ken was my key contact said j. nicholas hahn president and chief executive officer of cotton inc. which represents cotton producers 
 i do n't know mr. phillips all that well 
 i have n't seen or talked to him in several years 
 and some analysts questioned whether mr. phillips would have the skills ogilvy needs to turn the agency around 
 while the agency has done well in many parts of the world its flagship new york office has had a dismal track record recently it has won few new accounts while losing big ones including maxwell house 
 i think mr. phillips is going to need some help 
 i think they need creative leadership and i do n't think they have it said <unk> hill an analyst with wertheim & co 
 ogilvy & mather 's top creative executive norman berry left the agency earlier this year 
 <unk> berry was a creative <unk> at the company and nobody has filled that <unk> said ms. hill 
 but other analysts said that having mr. phillips succeed mr. roman would make for a smooth transition 
 graham phillips has been there a long time knows the culture well is aggressive and apparently gets along well with mr. sorrell said andrew <unk> an analyst with drexel burnham lambert 
 it 's probably a reasonable transition 
 hopefully he 'll be the answer to the problems they 've had in new york

 the operator of <unk> networks said the new turner pictures unit will produce movies that will premiere on turner broadcasting 's turner network television channel or <unk> and then will be released internationally in movie theaters 
 the unit 's first two offerings are slated to be the secret life of ian fleming a <unk> about the former british spy who wrote the james bond novels and <unk> island produced by <unk> <unk> who also stars in the movie 
 ted turner turner broadcasting 's chairman was named chairman of turner pictures and <unk> <unk> president of turner entertainment networks was named president of the unit 
 in an interview mr. <unk> said the subsidiary 's primary mission will be to make movies for <unk> and to distribute them internationally 
 but he said turner broadcasting already has found some ideas that might work well as films for theatrical release in the u.s. 
 when that occurs and when the time is right we 'll release the films in the u.s. he said adding that turner pictures may develop such movies next year for domestic release in N 
 turner has made several movies <unk> and <unk> for its networks in recent years but the company has never acted as a <unk> movie studio and released its own pictures to theaters 
 mr. <unk> said the secret life of ian fleming and <unk> island cost more than $ N million each to make which is only about one-third the cost of most movies made for theatrical release 
 the turner move is in line with a cable-tv trend toward more original programming and toward finding more ways to <unk> the high cost of producing films 
 in july viacom inc. formed viacom pictures to produce N <unk> movies a year that will premiere on showtime network and be distributed later in various markets including foreign theaters 
 in a sign the stock slump has n't <unk> europe 's takeover fever cie financiere de paribas said it intends to bid for one of france 's other large financial and industrial holding companies cie. de navigation mixte 
 paribas said that once it receives the <unk> from french stock market authorities it will offer to boost its navigation mixte stake to N N from the current N N 
 its <unk> bid values navigation mixte at about N billion francs $ N billion making this one of france 's <unk> attempted takeovers 
 the cost of buying the additional N N stake would be N billion francs $ N billion 
 the move would greatly boost paribas 's stake in the insurance transport and food businesses where navigation mixte is strong 
 it also would make paribas a major french ally of west germany 's allianz ag insurance group 
 allianz holds a N N stake in navigation mixte 's insurance interests acquired three weeks ago 
 those include <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and via assurances 
 long considered a potential takeover target navigation mixte had hoped allianz would help protect it from raiders 
 that idea may have <unk> 
 paribas is allianz 's main french bank and the <unk> group said it intends to stay neutral 
 navigation mixte said it would n't have any comment until its board meets wednesday 
 but navigation mixte is <unk> held and hard to defend 
 the defensive options are limited says <unk> <unk> a partner in portfolio management concern france finance <unk> 
 who would bid against paribas 
 if the paribas bid succeeds it will be the second time in two months a big french investment banking group has snapped up an insurance group 
 last month paribas 's archrival cie financiere de suez won a battle for <unk> <unk> france 's second-largest private-sector insurer which itself had just acquired west germany 's <unk> <unk> ag 
 that complex bid was billed as france 's largest takeover ever this one is slightly smaller 
 moreover suez had just finished winning an even larger battle last year for control of societe generale de <unk> 
 paribas officials once considered france 's <unk> bankers felt <unk> at suez 's success and its rapid growth 
 although paribas denies it analysts say the new bid in part simply reflects the continuing <unk> between france 's two largest investment banking groups 
 it also reflects the broader pressure on companies in europe to keep up as the european community prepares to reduce internal trade barriers by N 
 although paribas chairman <unk> <unk> would n't rule out eventually selling all of navigation mixte 's insurance operations to allianz he stressed the potential for the two groups instead to cooperate 
 he also told reporters the acquisition would give paribas fresh diversity bringing it properties in food and transport where it has been weak 
 navigation mixte has investments in a sugar company a food and <unk> concern a <unk> and bus and trucking firms among others 
 and navigation mixte has a huge hidden attraction 
 payment by allianz for the insurance interests it has just bought will help swell the french concern 's treasury to an estimated N billion francs 
 paribas said it will bid N francs a share for navigation mixte shares that qualify for a full yearly dividend and N francs for those created july N which are eligible for partial dividends 
 alternatively it said it would offer three paribas shares themselves eligible for dividends as of next jan. N for one navigation mixte share 
 paribas shares closed down N francs at N francs and navigation mixte shares were suspended at N francs pending the outcome of the bid 
 paribas said it would publish details of its bid once authorities clear it 
 this is one of the first bids under new takeover rules aimed at encouraging open bids instead of gradual accumulation of large stakes 
 some financial sources said privately that paribas <unk> in failing to move sooner for the insurance and industrial group bidding only after speculation had pushed up the price 
 mr. <unk> responded that his group initially intended to take only a minority stake striking an alliance with current management 
 when <unk> <unk> navigation mixte chairman marc fournier rejected paribas 's offer and began buying paribas shares in <unk> mr. <unk> said he felt obliged to bid for control 
 he told reporters he had information that mr. fournier was preparing to buy as much as N N of paribas up from less than N N currently 
 a bid against paribas could n't be ruled out 
 france 's second-largest government-owned insurance company assurances <unk> de france has been building its own navigation mixte stake currently thought to be between N N and N N 
 analysts said they do n't think it is contemplating a takeover however and its officials could n't be reached 
 crude oil futures prices fell further as analysts and traders said opec oil producers are n't putting the <unk> on output ahead of the traditionally weak first quarter 
 in trading on the new york mercantile exchange the u.s. benchmark west texas intermediate crude fell N cents a barrel to $ N for december delivery 
 petroleum products prices also declined 
 analysts pointed to reports that the organization of petroleum exporting countries is producing substantially more than its official limit of N million barrels a day with some accounts putting the <unk> group 's output as high as N million barrels a day 
 that level of production did n't take its toll on futures prices for the fourth quarter when demand is traditionally strong 
 but because first-quarter demand is normally the weakest of the year several market participants say opec production will have to decline to keep prices from eroding further 
 the group plans to meet in a month to discuss production strategy for early N 
 with prices already headed lower news of a series of explosions at a major phillips petroleum co. chemical facility on the houston ship channel also was bearish for prices 
 even though such facilities use a relatively small amount of crude analysts say now the facility wo n't need any at a time of already high availability 
 the phillips plant makes polyethylene <unk> and other plastic products 
 a company official said the explosions began when a seal <unk> out 
 dozens of workers were injured authorities said 
 there was no immediate estimate of damage from the company 
 some petroleum futures traders say technical considerations now will help to put downward pressure on futures prices 
 for instance one trader said that prices inevitably will go lower now that they 've fallen below $ N a barrel 
 our <unk> is a little bearish now that we 've taken out $ N he said 
 in other commodity markets yesterday 
 copper 
 the selling that started on friday continued yesterday 
 the december contract fell N cents a pound to $ N 
 london metal exchange warehouse stocks were down only N metric tons for the week to N tons expectations late last week were a drop of N to N tons 
 the new york market made its high for the day on the opening and when it dropped below the $ <unk> level selling picked up as previous buyers <unk> out of their positions and aggressive short sellers anticipating further declines moved in 
 fund selling also picked up at that point 
 according to bernard savaiko senior commodity analyst at painewebber the only stability to the market came when short sellers <unk> moved in to cover their positions by buying contracts 
 this activity produced small rallies which in turn attracted new short selling 
 mr. savaiko noted that copper had a steep fall in spite of a weak dollar which would normally support the u.s. copper market 
 such support usually comes from arbitragers who use a strong british pound to buy copper in new york 
 the sell-off would probably have been worse if the dollar had been strong he said 
 copper has been stuck in a trading range of $ N to $ N 
 mr. savaiko believes that if copper falls below the bottom of this range the next significant support level will be about $ N 
 precious metals 
 platinum and palladium struggled to maintain their prices all day despite news stories over the weekend that recent cold fusion experiments which use both metals showed signs of producing extra heat 
 january platinum closed down $ N an ounce at $ N nearly $ N above its low for the day 
 december palladium was off $ N an ounce at $ N 
 platinum is believed to have good support around $ N and palladium at around $ N 
 some traders were thought to be waiting for the auto sales report which will be released today 
 such sales are watched closely by platinum and palladium traders because both metals are used in automobile <unk> <unk> 
 mr. savaiko <unk> that the news on cold fusion did n't affect the market yesterday because many traders have already been badly <unk> by such stories 
 he said the traders are demanding a higher level of proof before they will buy palladium again 
 also weighing on both metals ' prices is the role of the chief supplier the soviet union 
 many analysts believe that the soviets ' <unk> for dollars this year to buy grain and other western commodities and goods will bring them to the market whenever prices rally very much 
 grains and soybeans 
 prices closed mixed as contracts reacted to largely offsetting bullish and bearish news 
 on the chicago board of trade soybeans for november delivery closed at $ N a bushel down half a cent while the december wheat contract rose <unk> of a cent to $ N a bushel 
 supporting prices was the announcement late friday of additional grain sales to the soviet union 
 but acting as a drag on prices was the improved harvest weather over the weekend and the prospect for continued fair weather this week over much of the farm belt 
 strong farmer selling over the weekend also weighed on prices 
 sugar 
 world prices tumbled mostly from their own weight according to analysts 
 the march contract ended at N cents a pound down N cent 
 for the past week or so traders have been expecting india to buy between N and N tons of refined sugar and there have been expectations of a major purchase by japan 
 but with no reports of either country actually entering the market analysts said futures prices became vulnerable 
 developing countries such as india some analysts said seem to have made it a point to stay away whenever sugar reached the top of its trading range around N cents and wait for prices to return to the bottom of the range around N cents 
 but <unk> <unk> a sugar analyst with <unk> <unk> international ltd. said the explanation for the latest drop in sugar prices is much simpler speculators he said got too long too soon and ran into resistance around the old contract highs 
 a painewebber analyst said that in light of a new estimate of a production increase of four million metric tons and only a modest increase in consumption sugar is n't likely to rise above the top of its trading range without a crop problem in a major producing country 
 cocoa 
 futures rallied modestly 
 the december contract rose $ N a metric ton to $ N near its high for the day 
 <unk> & <unk> ltd. a british <unk> house estimated that the N world cocoa surplus would be N tons down from N tons for the previous year 
 market technicians were encouraged by the price patterns which in the past have <unk> sharp rallies 
 recent prices for cocoa have been near levels last seen in the mid-1970s 
 at such prices according to mr. savaiko bargain hunting and <unk> buying back of contracts previously sold by speculators is n't uncommon 
 but mr. savaiko expects <unk> producer selling at around the $ N to $ N level 
 he also noted that a strong sterling market yesterday might have helped cocoa in new york as arbitragers took advantage of the currency move 
 <unk> <unk> research analyst at shearson lehman hutton said the market pushed higher mainly in anticipation of a late harvest in the ivory coast a major cocoa producer 
 rockwell international corp. bought out <unk> corp. 's interest in <unk> a joint venture of the two companies based in tokyo

 the bond market which sometimes <unk> on bad news cheered yesterday 's stock market sell-off and perceptions that the economy is growing weaker 
 early in the day bonds rose modestly on economists ' forecasts that this week 's slate of economic data will <unk> an economy headed for trouble 
 such news is good for bonds because economic weakness sometimes causes the federal reserve to lower interest rates in an effort to stimulate the economy and <unk> off a recession 
 for example today the department of commerce is scheduled to release the september durable goods report 
 the consensus forecast of N economists surveyed by dow jones capital markets report is for a N N drop in september orders 
 that would follow a N N advance in august 
 bonds received a bigger boost later in the day when stock prices moved broadly lower

 in the treasury market analysts expect bond prices to trade in narrow ranges this week as the market takes in positive and negative news 
 on the negative side the market will be affected by constant supply in all sectors of the market said william m. <unk> economist at daiwa securities america inc

 today the treasury will sell $ N billion of new two-year notes 
 tomorrow resolution funding corp. a division of a new government agency created to bail out the nation 's troubled thrifts will hold its first bond auction at which it will sell $ N billion of 30-year bonds 
 so far money managers and other bond buyers have n't shown much interest in the refcorp bonds 
 analysts have mixed views about the two-year note auction 
 while some say the auction should proceed smoothly others contend that yesterday 's sale of $ N billion of asset-backed securities by ford motor credit corp. may have <unk> some potential institutional buyers from the government 's note sale 
 the division of auto maker ford motor co. made its debut in the asset-backed securities market with the second-largest issue in the market 's four-year history 
 the company offered securities backed by automobile loans through an underwriting group headed by first boston corp 
 the issue yields N N and carries a guarantee covering N N of the deal from the company 
 first boston sweetened the terms from the original yield estimate in an apparent effort to place the huge offering 
 the issue was offered at a yield nearly one percentage point above the yield on two-year treasurys

 the federal national mortgage association offered $ N billion of remic securities in three issues and the federal home loan mortgage corp. offered a $ N million remic backed by N N <unk> securities 
 part of the reason for the heavy activity in derivative markets is that underwriters are <unk> mortgage securities being sold by thrifts 
 traders said thrifts have stepped up their mortgage securities sales as the bond market has risen in the past two weeks 
 in the mortgage <unk> sector active issues rose but trailed gains in the treasury market 
 government national mortgage association N N securities for november delivery were quoted late yesterday at N N up N and freddie mac N N securities were at N N up N

 an official with lead underwriter first boston said orders for the san antonio bonds were on the slow side

 manville having rid itself of asbestos now sells <unk> forest products minerals and industrial goods 
 <unk> stuff it 's not 
 but manville 's ownership is unusual and it has caught the eye of some <unk> and patient investors 
 the <unk> concern which emerged from bankruptcy-law proceedings late last year is controlled by the manville personal injury settlement trust 
 the trust which owns N N of manville 's stock on a fully diluted basis is a separate legal entity that is settling claims with asbestos victims 
 when and if the trust runs out of cash which seems increasingly likely it will need to convert its manville stock to cash 
 but as an N N owner if it tried to sell much of its stock in the market it would likely depress the price of its shares 
 some investors say there is a good chance that the trust will instead seek to convert the company 's shares to cash in some sort of friendly restructuring that would n't involve just <unk> stock on the market 
 their principal asset is manville common stock says jeffrey <unk> who runs <unk> associates an investment fund that owns manville shares 
 if they tried to sell they 'd be chasing their own <unk> 
 what makes the most sense is to find someone who wants to buy the whole company or cause a recapitalization of all shares 
 the trust is n't commenting on when it might need to <unk> its manville stock 
 however the trust 's cash flow from investments is far short of its payments to asbestos victims 
 its cash and liquid securities fell by $ N million in the first six months of N 
 the trust also will receive $ N million a year starting in N on a bond it holds from manville 
 and beginning in N it will have a claim on as much as N N of manville 's annual net income 
 even so the trust would seem to be facing a cash crunch 
 as of june N it had settled only about N of the N received claims from asbestos victims for an average of $ N each 
 the average should drop over time since the most expensive claims are being settled first 
 and as of midyear settled but unpaid claims amounted to $ N million more than half the trust 's total of $ N million in cash and <unk> securities 
 at some point we 're going to need an <unk> of funds a person close to the trust says 
 even before then the trust may be eager to unload manville stock 
 it does n't pay a dividend and this trust needs income 
 moreover with N N of its assets tied up in manville the trust is badly in need of diversification 
 obviously a diversified portfolio would have less risk the person close to the trust says 
 manville itself does n't rule out a restructuring 
 though the ink is barely dry on its new <unk> law structure bill bullock manville 's head of investor relations says the company is continually <unk> whether there is a better way to be structured 
 we understand that the trust is ultimately going to need to sell some of our shares he says 
 of course one option would be for manville to buy out the trust 's shares which would do little to benefit public stockholders 
 but the trust in most cases is <unk> from seeking a buyer for only its shares before november N 
 and both the trust and manville are seeking to avoid the bad publicity that in the asbestos era <unk> the manville name 
 thus analysts say the trust is unlikely to do anything that would hurt manville 's other shareholders 
 this is a rare case of a company with a big majority holder which will probably act in the interests of the minority holders one investor says 
 even if there is no restructuring manville seems to be attractive long-term 
 its stock at N N trades at about N N times estimated N earnings an <unk> low multiple for a company with <unk> customers 
 mr. bullock says N N of revenues are tied to construction 
 analysts predict little or no near-term growth 
 they are nonetheless high on manville 's management 
 it 's one of the best in the business says salomon brothers analyst stephen <unk> 
 and he says manville has the financial flexibility to buy other companies at the best possible moment when other <unk> firms are hurting and selling cheap 
 with a conservative <unk> ratio of <unk> and $ N million in cash manville is indeed actively on the <unk> 
 so far as a <unk> <unk> manville has n't bought much 
 paul <unk> an analyst at duff & phelps says even though they have borrowing power they have been disciplined about acquisitions 
 and mr. <unk> says that with N N of its stock in friendly hands manville is the rare publicly traded company that can ignore short-term stock fluctuations and plan for the long haul

 santa fe pacific corp. is preparing a plan to sell a N N stake in its large real estate unit to a california public employee pension fund for $ N million after which it would spin off the realty operation to shareholders 
 the plan places an indicated value on the real estate operation santa fe pacific realty corp. of $ N billion 
 santa fe pacific directors are expected to review the plan at a meeting today according to people familiar with the transaction 
 if approved the sale is expected to close by year 's end with the spinoff <unk> by the end of N 
 in composite trading on the new york stock exchange yesterday santa fe pacific closed at $ N down N cents 
 santa fe pacific realty is a major california land and building owner whose prime properties include N undeveloped acres in the san francisco bay area and several office sites 
 a spokesman said the properties survived without significant damage in last week 's northern california earthquake 
 as a result of the partial sale and spinoff the $ N billion california public employees retirement system would obtain two seats on the board of the real estate operation according to officials of the fund who described the plan 
 a spokesman for chicago-based santa fe pacific confirmed that negotiations were being held with the fund 
 also holding two seats each on the board they said would be olympia & york developments ltd. controlled by the <unk> family of canada and itel corp. controlled by chicago businessman sam <unk> 
 the <unk> and mr. <unk> the largest holders of santa fe pacific stock have been looking for ways to raise the value of their investments including possible <unk> 
 itel bought a N N stake in <unk> fe pacific last year and olympia & york later purchased about a N N stake they would have interests in the new realty company in line with their holdings in <unk> fe pacific 
 the sale and spinoff of the real estate unit is the first phase of what could lead to the breakup of santa fe pacific into <unk> companies for its railroad and energy operations as well as real estate 
 the <unk> parent has been under pressure from large shareholders to boost the company 's share price 
 at the same time it has been caught in an earnings squeeze 
 the california pension fund 's planned investment in the real estate unit is unusual 
 pension funds rarely own as much as a N N stake in what is expected to be a publicly traded company 
 in addition pension funds are rarely given seats on company boards and most often try to avoid them because of legal concerns 
 but fund officials said the santa fe pacific realty investment provides an opportunity to buy a stake in a large real estate portfolio heavily weighted with california properties 
 it also marks a major commitment to real estate development which we have n't been involved with before said dale hanson the fund 's executive director 
 under the proposed plan the fund would also lend santa fe pacific realty $ N million in the form of a note that would be convertible into additional shares of the realty company after the second year at the <unk> market price 
 the note would <unk> interest at the rate of N N a year which would be payable to the fund after five years according to stephen e. <unk> a real estate consultant working for the fund 
 the purpose of the note is to provide added capital for the <unk> company in a form that will save it spending cash on immediate interest payments mr. <unk> said 
 the <unk> concern clearly will be one of the dominant real estate development companies with a prime portfolio he said 
 for the last year santa fe pacific has <unk> its real estate operations toward longer-term development of its properties hurting profits that the parent had generated in the past from periodic sales from its portfolio 
 real estate operating income for the first nine months fell to $ N million from $ N million a year earlier the company said 
 in a statement late yesterday santa fe pacific 's chairman robert d. <unk> said that santa fe pacific realty would repay more than $ N million in debt owed to the parent before the planned spinoff 
 that would help reduce santa fe pacific 's remaining debt to about $ N million from a high of $ N billion in early N 
 it was n't clear where santa fe pacific expected to obtain the payment of more than $ N million which would be well above the $ N million that california pension fund officials say they plan to provide 
 the realty unit might take on new debt or obtain additional investors among other possibilities 
 the santa fe pacific spokesman declined to comment on that aspect saying the deal was still under negotiation 
 santa fe pacific realty owns N million acres of property including N buildings with more than N million square feet of space 
 it also holds nearly N acres of raw land with development potential but under a previously announced strategy the company has targeted building on N acres in california arizona and the chicago area 
 among those are the N acres in the san francisco bay area including N acres in the mission bay area 
 the california pension fund which has $ N billion already invested in real estate and mortgages could be a valuable funding source for that development although it is n't obliged to make further investments 
 the fund is the nation 's largest public employee fund and it has a growing cash flow now <unk> $ N billion a year 
 fund officials negotiated the final structure of the proposed deal with santa fe pacific but they were approached with the idea by real estate brokers <unk> realty corp. of chicago 
 <unk> officials are expected to be hired to represent the pension fund on the santa fe pacific realty board mr. <unk> said to <unk> the fund from potential liability problems 
 gaf part iii is scheduled to begin today 
 after two <unk> the stakes in the stock manipulation trial of gaf corp. and its vice chairman james t. sherwin have changed considerably 
 the first two gaf trials were watched closely on wall street because they were considered to be important tests of the government 's ability to convince a jury of allegations stemming from its insider-trading investigations 
 in an <unk> indictment the government charged gaf a wayne n.j. chemical maker and mr. sherwin with illegally attempting to manipulate the common stock of union carbide corp. in advance of gaf 's planned sale of a large block of the stock in N 
 the government 's credibility in the gaf case depended heavily on its star witness boyd l. jefferies the former los angeles brokerage chief who was <unk> by former <unk> ivan boesky and then pointed the finger at mr. sherwin takeover <unk> <unk> b. lewis and corporate raider paul <unk> 
 the gaf trials were viewed as <unk> of the government 's strength in its cases against mr. lewis and mr. <unk> 
 mr. jefferies 's performance as a witness was expected to affect his sentencing 
 but gaf 's bellwether role was short-lived 
 the first gaf trial ended in a <unk> after four weeks when u.s. district judge mary johnson lowe found that a prosecutor improperly but <unk> withheld a document 
 after N hours of <unk> the jurors in the second trial said they were <unk> <unk> and another <unk> was declared on march N 
 meanwhile a federal jury found mr. <unk> guilty on securities fraud and other charges in june 
 a month later mr. jefferies was <unk> a jail term by a federal judge who praised him for helping the government 
 in august mr. lewis pleaded guilty to three felony counts 
 nevertheless the stakes are still high for the players directly involved in the gaf case 
 the <unk> have left the <unk> of gaf mr. sherwin and gaf chairman samuel <unk> in limbo 
 for mr. sherwin a conviction could carry penalties of five years in prison and a $ N fine on each count 
 gaf faces potential fines of $ N for each count 
 individuals familiar with the case said that throughout september defense attorneys were talking with the government in an effort to prevent a trial but by the end of the month the talks had ended 
 there is much speculation among attorneys not involved that the strategy of gaf 's attorney arthur <unk> and mr. sherwin 's counsel stephen <unk> will include testimony by mr. sherwin or mr. <unk> 
 neither testified at the previous trials 
 for now defense attorneys are <unk> about their plans 
 max <unk> another gaf defense attorney said yesterday as we go in for the third time <unk> <unk> 's famous line is apt it 's <unk> <unk> all over again 
 dalkon shield claimants hope to stop <unk> appeal 
 attorneys for more than N women who claim injuries from the dalkon shield contraceptive device have asked the u.s. supreme court to refuse to hear an appeal of the bankruptcy-law reorganization plan for <unk> robins co. which manufactured the device 
 the dispute pits two groups of claimants against each other 
 baltimore attorney michael a. <unk> and N other attorneys representing N claimants in the u.s. and abroad argue that the appeal would delay and perhaps even destroy a $ N billion settlement fund that is the centerpiece of the reorganization plan 
 the bankruptcy-court reorganization is being challenged before the supreme court by a dissident group of claimants because it places a cap on the total amount of money available to settle claims 
 it also bars future suits against robins company officials members of the robins family and robins 's former insurer aetna life & casualty co 
 the latter provision is legally unprecedented said alan b. morrison a public interest lawyer in washington d.c. who is challenging the plan on behalf of N claimants 
 more than N claims against robins are pending 
 the company made and marketed the dalkon shield in the early 1970s amid mounting evidence that it could cause serious injuries 
 robins has been in proceedings under chapter N of the u.s. bankruptcy code since august N such proceedings give it protection from creditor lawsuits while it works out a plan for paying its debts 
 american home products corp. wants to acquire robins but only if all legal challenges to the plan are exhausted 
 in a brief filed with the supreme court last week mr. <unk> <unk> the appeal for raising <unk> and theoretical legal issues while <unk> the proposed reorganization and the settlement payments to claimants 
 the supreme court is scheduled to consider the case nov. N and may issue a decision as early as nov. N 
 jury 's criminal conviction under superfund law is a first 
 charles a. <unk> sole <unk> of a louisville ky. <unk> company was found guilty of violating the superfund law as well as the clean air act 
 criminal convictions under the federal superfund law are rare and the decision is the first jury verdict in such a case 
 under superfund those who owned generated or <unk> hazardous waste are liable for its cleanup regardless of whether their actions were legal at the time 
 environmental lawyers say virtually all of the superfund cases to date have involved civil penalties designed to insure cleanup of past <unk> activities 
 but superfund also contains a criminal provision concerning the release of toxic <unk> into the environment 
 in N congress strengthened the penalty by making it a felony 
 mr. <unk> was convicted in louisville late last month of violating superfund by failing to report the release of asbestos into the environment from a building he was <unk> 
 he was also convicted of failing to properly remove asbestos from the building a violation of the clean air act 
 the government sought a criminal penalty because no cleanup is possible here 
 once asbestos is released into the environment it can <unk> anywhere says richard a. dennis the assistant u.s. attorney who prosecuted the case 
 mr. <unk> is scheduled to be sentenced dec. N 
 his lawyer could not be reached for comment 
 mr. <unk> faces as much as three years in prison and a $ N fine for the superfund conviction and as much as one year in prison and a $ N fine for the violation of the clean air act 
 ted <unk> lawyers switch to victims ' side in <unk> case 
 <unk> cutler & <unk> the washington d.c. law firm that spent over $ N million fighting the execution of <unk> ted <unk> who eventually was executed has taken on another death penalty case before the supreme court this time on the side of the family of four murder victims in arkansas 
 the law firm has filed a <unk> brief jointly with the washington legal foundation a conservative legal group 
 the key issue in the case which the law firm is handling without a fee or pro bono is whether a person sentenced to death can voluntarily waive his rights of appellate review 
 the <unk> ronald gene simmons was convicted of killing N people 
 another <unk> on death row has appealed mr. simmons 's death sentence in a next friend capacity 
 <unk> cutler 's brief argues that there is no mandatory appellate review of capital sentences and that the <unk> who filed the appeal lacks proper standing 
 <unk> mode <unk> cutler 's managing partner says the trial team that represented mr. <unk> was asked by the firm 's pro bono committee whether the new case posed a conflict and that no objections were raised 
 the <unk> of the law firm and the washington legal foundation is odd also because <unk> cutler was one of the firms singled out for criticism two years ago by the conservative legal group for <unk> a liberal bias in its pro bono work

 henry <unk> the assistant u.s. attorney handling the case said about N customers were <unk> and that <unk> 's total proceeds from the sales were $ N million 
 attorneys for messrs. burke and evans and ms. <unk> said that although their clients admitted to making some <unk> in the sales they had believed that the works were authorized by mr. <unk> who died in january

 <unk> said mr. decker 's posts were assumed by david <unk> <unk> 's chairman who at N years of age becomes one of the youngest chief executives of a sizable bank in the country 
 mr. decker is about N years old 
 neither mr. <unk> nor mr. decker could be reached to comment 
 <unk> has about $ N billion of assets and is the largest independent bank in northern california 
 it controls about N N of the affluent <unk> county market across the golden gate bridge from san francisco 
 mr. decker 's resignation surprised many industry officials 
 he was brought to the company in september N after N years at los angeles-based first interstate bancorp

 when he was hired mr. <unk> <unk> mr. decker 's extraordinary skills and his outstanding reputation as one of the west 's <unk> bankers

 it said it will exercise that right only if it sells substantially all of its other core businesses 
 it also can sell the right to regain the subsidiary to another party 
 also the broker-dealer subsidiary integrated resources equity corp. was renamed royal alliance associates inc

 integrated will pump $ N million to $ N million into royal alliance as initial funding 
 in an interview mr. <unk> said that based on criteria yet to be determined he expects to distribute N N of royal alliance to the representatives who sell integrated 's insurance and mutual-fund products 
 if integrated <unk> royal alliance the representatives will retain their N N ownership 
 mr. <unk> indicated that completion of the transaction could take several weeks and it was n't immediately clear what would happen to the broker-dealer subsidiary if integrated files for bankruptcy-law protection in the meantime

 the market 's attention is especially focused on a preliminary report on the u.s. third-quarter gross national product due out thursday which could show the economy is continuing to expand at a relatively brisk pace

 few market participants expect the u.s. unit to rally sharply on the news if it turns out as expected

 the most significant changes in department policy are new requirements that federal prosecutors avoid <unk> the normal business functions of companies charged under the racketeering law a senior department official said 
 another important revision of department policy is a new guideline warning prosecutors not to take steps that would harm innocent third parties in a case brought under the racketeering law the official david runkel said 
 the department distributed the revisions and <unk> to u.s. attorneys around the country this summer as part of a routine process of <unk> prosecutorial guidelines mr. runkel said

 future witnesses include a former federal s&l regulator who has accused the five senators of attempting to <unk> the regulatory process by <unk> on behalf of mr. keating

 mr. gonzalez expressed concern over a report that the two had been summoned to washington by mr. wall last week to discuss their testimony in advance 
 i think he is trying to improperly influence a witness and by god i 'm not going to <unk> it he says 
 mr. wall however is a <unk> child of the senate and former staff director of its banking committee 
 an inquiry into his handling of lincoln s&l inevitably will drag in sen. cranston and the four others sens. dennis <unk> d. ariz. john <unk> r. ariz. john glenn d. ohio and donald <unk> d. mich 
 they all attended a meeting in april N questioning why a federal audit of lincoln s&l had dragged on for two years 
 i 'm certain that in the course of the hearings the names of the senators will be brought out mr. gonzalez says 
 this is raising <unk> 
 when i first got a <unk> at the witness list i could n't believe that they were going to go ahead and do this says michael <unk> director of congress watch a consumer group 
 there are some witnesses who will be forced to testify about their meetings with senators 
 and a democratic aide to a banking committee member remarks i too am <unk> by it because gonzalez has certainly placed a lot of democratic senators in a very bad position 
 all the senators say they merely were trying to ensure fairness for a <unk> 
 mr. keating lives in phoenix and the california thrift 's parent is an <unk> corporation with holdings in michigan 
 chairman gonzalez <unk> <unk> for sen. <unk> his counterpart as chairman of the senate banking committee 
 he 's <unk> he 's good and i know he 's an honest man the <unk> says 
 but at the same time mr. gonzalez has n't forgotten a confrontation over mr. wall during house-senate negotiations over s&l bailout legislation during the summer 
 the senate negotiators included sens. cranston and <unk> and mr. wall 's principal sponsor republican sen. <unk> <unk> of utah 
 they were willing to trade important provisions in the bailout legislation to preserve mr. wall 's job and to avoid a <unk> hearing in which he would be called upon to testify about lincoln s&l 
 most <unk> the senate traded away the bush administration 's controversial plan to finance the bailout which was partly <unk> later 
 at the time mr. gonzalez said several senators told him that they could get some <unk> out of the way if there could be some understanding on <unk> 's insistence on wall 
 now mr. gonzalez is holding the equivalent of <unk> hearings anyway under the <unk> of the lincoln investigation 
 in a way that 's what this is mr. gonzalez concedes 
 even some house banking committee members could suffer from the fallout 
 mr. keating raised $ N for rep. doug <unk> 's N re-election campaign while the georgia democrat was taking his side against regulators who wanted to curb risky investments and wholesale deposit <unk> 
 he recently voted present when the committee authorized a subpoena to <unk> mr. keating to testify then changed his vote to yes 
 but the chairman 's supporters have the upper hand as federal regulators press a $ N billion fraud suit against mr. keating and others 
 rep. jim <unk> r. iowa says the lincoln s&l affair is the biggest bank <unk> in history and adds the great question that remains to be resolved is whether we have a congressional <unk> in the making 
 a witness set to testify on thursday was quoted in a news report over the weekend as saying lincoln <unk> campaign contributions illegally 
 but the witness william <unk> california 's chief state thrift regulator denies saying that 
 i do n't know whether it was done properly or not because i 'm not a lawyer he said in a telephone interview yesterday 
 but he said he is prepared to testify that executives of lincoln and its parent corporation got unusually high salaries and frequent calls <unk> them to make specific contributions 
 the committee also has summoned mr. wall 's predecessor edwin gray 
 he has characterized the five senators ' roles as <unk> to an attempt to <unk> the regulatory process and he is n't expected to back down even though the five senators have disputed his account of a N meeting 
 so the senators must <unk> themselves 
 sen. cranston as he returned to the capital last week from a one-day trip to <unk> earthquake damage in san francisco <unk> to an aide well back to <unk> 
 when anne volokh and her family <unk> to the u.s. N years ago they started life in los angeles with only $ N 
 they 'd actually left the soviet union with $ N but during a stop in italy ms. volokh dropped $ N on a black <unk> suit 
 not surprisingly she quickly adapted to the american way 
 three months after she arrived in l.a. she spent $ N she did n't have for a hat 
 a <unk> she <unk> though it was n't the time for that N years ago 
 but i loved <unk> 
 since then she has become wealthy 
 her husband and older son a computer <unk> <unk> in the wall street journal in N when he was N run a software company with expected sales this year of $ N million 
 most recently she has become the publisher of <unk> a four-year-old los angeles magazine that began national distribution last month with an initial press run of N copies 
 distributed by the hearst corp. 's eastern news the glossy publication <unk> <unk> fair 's <unk> <unk> and premiere 's <unk> <unk> into <unk> <unk> with a special emphasis on <unk> as fashion <unk> 
 it 's being sold through <unk> <unk> and some video stores 
 though ms. volokh is a small woman she has an <unk> <unk> and dramatic <unk> that seem perfectly <unk> to capitalism as it is practiced in hollywood 
 certainly life for her has changed considerably since the days in <unk> when she lived with her parents her husband and her two sons in a N <unk> apartment in what she calls silent internal <unk> <unk> of escape 
 now for example she owns N hats 
 however she <unk> the lean years and recalls with <unk> wearing her first major american purchase that <unk> N years later and having a los angeles <unk> owner ask her if it was a <unk> 
 with obvious satisfaction she says she told him no <unk> i just give it a <unk> look 
 she keeps track of the rest of her hats by <unk> polaroid <unk> to the outside of each <unk> 
 are the hats merely part of her new l.a. <unk> along with the many <unk> <unk> cigarettes she <unk> the parties she throws for N people the <unk> <unk> she offers guests at her weekend place in santa barbara 
 no <unk> she said recently in her <unk> slightly affected english during a trip east to promote <unk> 's national expansion 
 you have to be born with it 
 i used to wear hats in russia but i had to make them and my <unk> 
 on the hat side i was n't getting what i wanted 
 now N years old ms. volokh has <unk> ideas about what she wants 
 at <unk> she wants specific <unk> specific tone a specific attitude bright and bold and <unk> 
 in restaurants in this case the russian <unk> a new york restaurant operated by and for soviet <unk> she did n't want the <unk> <unk> music <unk> through the room 
 you people here think this is russian music she said with <unk> and called over to the <unk> could you turn it off 
 that done ms. volokh spoke with rampant <unk> about the many attributes she feels she was born with an understanding of food business russian culture human nature and parties 
 parties are rather a state of mind she said <unk> only to taste and pass judgment on the <unk> <unk> a little well done but very good 
 if you are born to give parties you give parties 
 even in russia we managed to give parties 
 in los angeles in our lean years we gave parties 
 as publisher of a magazine devoted to movies as <unk> for fashion and other <unk> ms. volokh sees her <unk> as an important part of business 
 she has thrown <unk> <unk> for <unk> of people but prefers more intimate <unk> 
 at american <unk> parties everyone 's always looking over your shoulder to see who they can talk to next 
 i like rather tea because it is at the end of the day 
 she serves high russian tea at N p.m 
 it 's supposed to be later but i just moved it 
 in los angeles it 's important to catch people just after work 
 she also frequently invites directors producers actors writers and other show business people for coffee and <unk> in the pleasure <unk> 
 guests bring movies on tape and show their favorite <unk> minute segments on the screen that <unk> from the ceiling of the <unk> ' <unk> library the pleasure <unk> 
 they eat <unk> and <unk> things and explain their <unk> 
 it 's very <unk> and soul baring said ms. volokh 
 the idea for <unk> actually was <unk> up by an old friend of the <unk> <unk> <unk> who has the title of <unk> and <unk> <unk> smith now the magazine 's <unk> 
 mr. <unk> approached ms. volokh five years ago about backing the publication which started out as a listing guide 
 she was interested only if she could guide it <unk> as well 
 anne does n't believe in <unk> said ms. smith 
 she wants things to be exciting 
 and she has this <unk> energy 
 she 'll think of an idea the editorial people think is impossible then she 'll have us make it work 
 in fact ms. volokh was n't just a rich lady who needed a <unk> 
 back in the soviet union she was a respected journalist writing a weekly column about the national <unk> for sunday <unk> 
 those columns vivid discussions of the cultural and literary <unk> of food as well as practical advice on how to <unk> <unk> <unk> meals became the basis for her <unk> and entertaining <unk> the art of russian <unk> brought out in N by macmillan publishing co 
 i do n't trust people who do n't eat said ms. volokh though she herself stopped eating lunch a few years ago to drop N pounds 
 look at <unk> and <unk> 
 no one ever <unk> in their books and look at them 
 <unk> 's characters eat <unk> 's <unk> 's 
 in her <unk> which macmillan is bringing out in soft cover this month with the <unk> <unk> revised so it works she <unk> each chapter with appropriate quotations from russian literature <unk> on <unk> <unk> on <unk> 
 in life she offers practical <unk> advice divide your meals into important and <unk> 
 in a great restaurant do n't <unk> yourself 
 the other meals do n't matter 
 amusing as she is and <unk> as she can seem this is a serious person with some difficult memories 
 she was the child of relative privilege 
 her mother was a <unk> her father was the <unk> vice director 
 i <unk> to wear better hats do better parties she said with a <unk> 
 but we should n't leave out political reasons number one 
 you try to maintain your dignity under difficult circumstances 
 one can not imagine how you live when you live those double and triple lives 
 by N after their second child was born it had become clear to ms. volokh and her husband <unk> a computer scientist that they wanted to leave the <unk> 
 ms. volokh quit her job to remove herself from the public eye 
 the wait was <unk> 
 before granting ms. volokh 's parents a visa the government required her mother to obtain permission from her first husband whom she had <unk> N years earlier 
 mr. volokh was fired from his job and had to endure hours of organized <unk> abuse from his <unk> accusations of sabotage and <unk> activities 
 the <unk> were afraid that they 'd end up like a friend of theirs who 'd applied for a visa and waited for N years having been <unk> from his profession of theoretical <unk> to shipping clerk 
 they did n't 
 their visa came in relatively short order and they moved to los angeles 
 mr. volokh soon found work in his field but ms. volokh refused the obvious and available <unk> as <unk> for a russian who spoke <unk> english 
 that 's always looking back she said 
 i wanted to be in business 
 on the way to that goal she received her first u.s. <unk> for <unk> a book of polish <unk> attended <unk> school then went to work for a fund-raising organization 
 soon she was running the office 
 when her husband and son founded their computer company <unk> she worked as business manager <unk> and <unk> 
 now <unk> is located in the same building as <unk> 
 things work out unexpectedly in life said ms. volokh 
 you never know if you 'll be chosen to be the <unk> or the lucky one 
 we were lucky 
 william d. <unk> president of the <unk> trade and economic council has a warning for u.s. companies trying to do business in the soviet union 
 it 's an extremely complex market and you have to be prepared to make a big commitment mr. <unk> says 
 we are not trying to encourage everyone 
 <unk> by such words of caution corporate america is <unk> to moscow <unk> by a huge <unk> market and mikhail gorbachev 's attempt to overhaul the soviet economy 
 doing business with the russians once the pursuit of a handful of <unk> veterans has become the goal of such major companies as general motors corp. federal express corp. and procter & gamble co. as well as a <unk> of smaller firms 
 reflecting the <unk> interest more than N u.s. companies are taking part in a moscow exhibition organized by mr. <unk> 's trade group 
 but while u.s. interest may be big and growing the difficulties that have <unk> deals in the past show no sign of <unk> 
 alongside the old problems of a <unk> currency and an <unk> bureaucracy western business executives must now <unk> with new <unk> linked to perestroika the restructuring of the soviet economy 
 executives say mr. gorbachev 's moves to break up the government 's foreign trade monopoly have created uncertainties as well as opportunities 
 changing legislation has opened the field to thousands of <unk> soviet players many who promise more than they can deliver 
 and some foreign firms are finding that even when they manage to overcome such hurdles their ventures now have to be endorsed by such <unk> bodies as the soviet parliament and the governments of the nation 's republics 
 you have to go out to all your constituents says james h. <unk> who is <unk> the most ambitious attempt by u.s. firms to break into the soviet market involving investment of more than $ N billion in some two dozen joint ventures 
 as part of that attempt by the american trade consortium mr. <unk> says he spends a lot of time lobbying 
 growing public fears about the soviet environment is one new factor affecting some joint-venture plans 
 over the past two years soviet ministries have been talking to international firms including occidental petroleum co. and combustion engineering inc. of the u.s. montedison <unk> of italy and several japanese groups about jointly building and operating several big petrochemical plants 
 the plans have come under fire from soviet environmentalists and officials say many are likely to be scaled back or dropped 
 whatever the difficulties mr. gorbachev remains committed to increasing foreign trade 
 for political as well as economic reasons u.s. companies are at the top of his priorities a point he underscored by spending two hours walking around the u.s. trade show last week 
 talking to a small group of u.s. executives <unk> mr. gorbachev appeared <unk> for a big expansion in u.s.-soviet trade which now amounts to a <unk> $ N billion annually 
 the u.s. ranks fourth of countries that have concluded joint ventures behind west germany finland and italy 
 according to several people present at the meeting mr. gorbachev also supported the idea of concluding several commercial accords with the u.s. possibly at his next summit meeting with president bush 
 judging by the crush at the exhibition deprived soviet consumers are more than ready for u.s. products 
 hundreds of people lined up every day at the colgate-palmolive co. stand to receive a free tube of <unk> a commodity in <unk> short supply here 
 and <unk> <unk> at rjr nabisco inc. 's <unk> almost knocked over a glass <unk> in the rush to get a free <unk> cigarette <unk> 
 some u.s. products are <unk> into the soviet market under an emergency import program 
 both colgate and procter & gamble have received big orders for <unk> soap and <unk> 
 the american trade consortium says it is planning to ship some $ N million of consumer goods financed by bank credits in the first few months of next year 
 but the current soviet purchasing spree may be a one-time affair 
 the goal of most u.s. firms joint ventures remains <unk> 
 because the soviet ruble is n't convertible into dollars marks and other western currencies companies that hope to set up production facilities here must either export some of the goods to earn hard currency or find soviet goods they can take in a <unk> transaction 
 international competition for the few soviet goods that can be sold on world markets is heating up however 
 <unk> m. <unk> an entrepreneur from new jersey who buys soviet <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> for export to the u.s. says west german companies already have snapped up much of the production of these items 
 seeking to overcome the currency problems mr. <unk> 's american trade consortium which <unk> chevron corp. rjr johnson & johnson eastman kodak co. and <unk> co. has <unk> an elaborate scheme to share out dollar earnings largely from the revenues of a planned chevron oil project 
 several medical concerns including pfizer inc. hewlett-packard co. colgate and <unk> laboratories intend to pursue a similar consortium approach 
 it 's hard to invest capital here on the same basis as investing in other countries says dennis a. <unk> president of medical service partners inc. who is putting the medical consortium together 
 some u.s. entrepreneurs operate on a smaller scale 
 one group seeks to publish a u.s.-soviet medical journal in <unk> with the u.s.s.r. ministry of health 
 according to richard p. mills a <unk> official of the u.s. partner N copies of the quarterly will be printed in russian from next year 
 it will be financed by advertisements from u.s. companies and by simultaneous publication of an <unk> journal containing details of soviet medical <unk> 
 we found a market niche mr. mills boasts 
 it 's truly entrepreneurial

 the <unk> with credit agricole will give nuovo banco its first foreign presence since it was formed from the <unk> of the old banco ambrosiano which collapsed amid scandal after the death of chairman <unk> <unk> in N 
 since then the bank has strengthened its italian network and has posted strong results 
 the shareholders felt we needed a foreign presence more than we needed links with an insurance company an ambrosiano spokeswoman said 
 <unk> said in a statement that it reserves the right to take any action to protect its rights as a member of the syndicate 
 a company spokeswoman said the company had n't decided what measures to take but did n't rule out legal action

 friday qintex entertainment inc. a <unk> u.s. affiliate filed for protection from creditor lawsuits under chapter N of the u.s. bankruptcy code 
 analysts predicted that the move would further shake creditor confidence in qintex australia and force it to sell assets 
 the company 's latest moves were disclosed after the australian stock exchange suspended trading in shares of qintex australia and qintex ltd. because the companies had n't answered an exchange inquiry about the extent of their loans investments and deposits at qintex entertainment 
 mr. skase 's statement was addressed to the stock exchange and appeared to be a response to the inquiry 
 it said qintex entertainment owes qintex australia us$ N million in loans not secured by specific assets 
 qintex australia also said it has an investment of a$ N million in qintex entertainment shares 
 in the statement mr. skase said that on the basis of current interest rates in australia the company 's asset sales would reduce interest expense by about a$ N million a year in addition to eliminating certain liabilities 
 in march qintex sold N N of the three mirage resorts to japan 's nippon <unk> co. and mitsui & co. for a$ N million 
 yesterday 's statement did n't say whether the japanese companies will acquire qintex 's remaining stake in the resorts

 chip 's memory is here today here tomorrow 
 two companies plan to market a new chip with ceramic circuits that store data even when the power is off 
 today 's most widely used <unk> chips have volatile memories their data disappear if they are n't fed a steady diet of electricity so they need external power supplies 
 national semiconductor corp. and a start-up named <unk> corp. plan to start shipping so-called <unk> memories which can remember data for at least N years without any current flowing to them 
 the chips use materials such as lead <unk> <unk> to form <unk> switches that retain their data without electricity 
 developers caution that broad applications are several years away because the technology is n't fully refined 
 but <unk> of colorado springs colo. plans to start shipping commercial quantities of simple <unk> chips in december 
 the company expects the chips eventually to be used in devices that mimic a whole range of computer memory equipment including <unk> and hard-disk drives 
 national semiconductor is getting <unk> technology from <unk> corp. in <unk> <unk> 
 national says it agreed to acquire <unk> 's assets and will start shipping commercial quantities of its first chips including a <unk> memory next year 
 once production hurdles are overcome the chips could take over a significant part of the market 
 in addition to not <unk> an outside power source they are potentially cheaper to make because they require fewer manufacturing steps than conventional chips 
 military buyers have shown interest national says because <unk> chips resist <unk> radiation 
 and while today 's <unk> chips such as electronically <unk> <unk> <unk> memory chips ca n't be used in a computer 's central memory because they learn data slowly <unk> chips accept data at very high speeds 
 showing up in court without being there 
 an austin texas company plans to make it easy for you show up in court a thousand miles away without leaving town 
 witnesses often must travel long <unk> to give face-to-face <unk> before lawyers and court reporters 
 that means huge travel bills 
 and telephone or <unk> <unk> just do n't match physical <unk> 
 that could change thanks to lower long-distance rates and cheaper electronics 
 video <unk> corp. which markets <unk> systems is working with court reporters to wire a nationwide network to allow <unk> by live television 
 the company installed a prototype system that <unk> dallas with miami over digital phone lines 
 and it is preparing to set up shop in chicago new york and N other cities where <unk> agencies can tie conference rooms into the network 
 while lawyers arranged individual <unk> before the formal network of court reporters should make things easier and cheaper

 japanese reverse <unk> on patent protection 
 japan 's <unk> of u.s. patents has been a <unk> point for american chip makers 
 now at least one japanese company is turning the courtroom tables 
 until now most japanese charges have been responses to suits against them 
 but last year hitachi ltd. surprised japan 's electronics industry when it accused korea 's <unk> electronics co. of using hitachi technology to make dynamic <unk> memory chips 
 a settlement was reached but was n't made public 
 and hitachi went on the offensive against the u.s. 's motorola inc. earlier this month with a suit charging that motorola 's new <unk> chip <unk> on a hitachi patent 
 another recent hitachi suit <unk> motorola of reverse engineering a hitachi technology a <unk> from a nation of champion reverse engineers 
 the moves illustrate the more aggressive attitude toward patent protection that patent experts say japan is starting to take 
 hitachi made the <unk> charges in an amendment to a <unk> filed in a federal district court in texas after motorola sued hitachi for patent violation 
 hitachi charges motorola has engaged in fraudulent and <unk> conduct in the procurement of certain motorola patents used in motorola 's <unk> microprocessor chip 
 translation motorola appears to have taken a hitachi technology that is <unk> in the u.s. hitachi says and tried to make it look like a new technology 
 motorola either denied or would n't comment on the various charges 
 odds and ends 
 computer chips that <unk> human vision have been developed by japan 's sharp corp

 tandy corp. citing sluggish sales of <unk> goods said net income dropped N N for the first quarter ended sept. N 
 the results which represented the fifth consecutive quarter of <unk> earnings for the big electronics retailer disappointed analysts and traders 
 tandy 's stock fell $ N a share to close at $ N in new york stock exchange composite trading 
 net for the quarter was $ N million or N cents a share down from $ N million or N cents a share a year earlier 
 the company said earnings would have increased if it had n't been actively <unk> its shares thus increasing its interest expense and reducing its interest income 
 tandy had N million shares outstanding at sept. N down from N million a year earlier 
 revenue rose N N to $ N million from $ N million 
 tandy said consumer electronics sales at its radio shack stores have been slow partly because of a lack of hot new products 
 radio shack continues to be lackluster said dennis <unk> analyst with <unk> <unk> & turner in dallas 
 he said tandy has done a decent job increasing sales by manufacturing computers for others and expanding sales of its grid systems corp. subsidiary which sells computers to bigger businesses but it 's not enough to offset the problems at radio shack 
 sales at radio shack stores open more than a year grew only N N in the quarter from a year earlier he said 
 as a result mr. <unk> said he cut his fiscal N per-share earnings estimate for tandy to $ N from $ N 
 tandy earned $ N million or $ N a share in the year ended june N 
 barry bryant an analyst with drexel burnham lambert inc. said tandy also has suffered from <unk> sales of its computers aimed at the home and <unk> market which are <unk> and cheaper than computers aimed at the corporate market 
 tandy has added several new products to that line including a laptop computer priced around $ N and is focusing its advertising on the <unk> software that is packaged with its machines 
 mr. bryant and other analysts hope all those moves will combine to help tandy 's results improve in the important christmas quarter 
 they 've been promising N N to N N growth based on the strategic moves they 've made he said 
 if the earnings acceleration is to take place that should be the quarter 
 at a private dinner thursday drexel burnham lambert inc. chief executive frederick joseph delivered a <unk> message about the junk bond market to officials of prudential insurance co. of america 
 mr. joseph conceded the junk market was in disarray according to people familiar with the discussion 
 he said drexel the leading underwriter of high-risk junk bonds could no longer afford to sell any junk offerings if they might later become troubled because drexel <unk> losing its highly lucrative junk franchise 
 the dinner was a stark confirmation that N is the worst year ever for the $ N billion junk market 
 and investors and traders alike say the current turmoil could take years to resolve 
 amid the market <unk> even drexel which has the <unk> and most loyal following of junk bond investors is pulling in its <unk> 
 although the big investment bank still dominates the junk market drexel has been unable to stem the fallout from growing junk bond defaults withdrawn new offerings redemptions by shareholders in junk bond mutual funds and an exodus of <unk> investors 
 for many money managers the past four months have been <unk> 
 this is the worst <unk> ever in the junk market and it could take years before it 's over says mark <unk> a senior vice president at standard & poor 's corp. a credit rating company 
 in the third quarter for example junk bonds those with less than an investment-grade rating showed negative returns the only major sector of the bond market to do so 
 since the end of last year junk bonds have been outperformed by all categories of investment-grade bonds including <unk> treasury securities 
 the junk market which <unk> to $ N billion from less than $ N billion at the start of the decade has been declining for months as issuers have <unk> under the weight of hefty interest payments 
 the fragile market received its biggest jolt last month from campeau corp. which created its u.s. retailing empire with more than $ N billion in junk financing 
 campeau developed a cash squeeze that caused it to be <unk> on some interest payments and to put its prestigious bloomingdale 's department store chain up for sale 
 at that point the junk market went into a tailspin as buyers disappeared and investors tried to sell 
 in an interview mr. joseph says his dinner discussion with the prudential executives acknowledged problems for junk 
 what i thought i was saying is that the market is troubled but still viable and <unk> enough quite <unk> which is not at all bad he says 
 nobody 's been perfect in their credit judgments the past couple years and we 're going to make sure our default rates are going to be in the acceptable <unk> of the market 
 what has jolted many junk buyers is the sudden <unk> that junk bonds can not necessarily be bought and sold with the ease of common stocks and many investment-grade bonds 
 unlike the new york stock exchange where buyers and sellers are quickly matched the junk market where risky corporate loans are traded is sometimes closed for repairs 
 at closely held <unk> securities corp. junk bond money managers <unk> k. <unk> and <unk> h. <unk> say the problems of the junk market go deeper than a temporary <unk> 
 in recent months they say there has been heavy selling of junk bonds by some of the market 's traditional investors while new buyers have n't materialized to replace them 
 wall street securities firms the primary source of liquidity for the high yield market have been net sellers of junk bonds because of trading losses <unk> said in a recent grim report to customers 
 mutual funds have also been net sellers of junk bonds as junk 's relatively poor performance and negative press coverage have produced <unk> redemptions by shareholders <unk> said 
 investors trying to raise cash have sold large liquid issues such as rjr holdings corp. and <unk> co. declines in these benchmark issues have contributed to the market 's <unk> 
 and <unk> said buying has been severely reduced because savings and loans have been restricted in their junk purchases by recently passed congressional legislation 
 in fact savings and loans were sellers of high yield holdings throughout the quarter <unk> said 
 ms. <unk> and ms. <unk> say they are managing their junk portfolios <unk> building cash and <unk> upgrading the overall quality 
 meanwhile prudential the nation 's largest insurer and the biggest investor in junk bonds has seen the value of its junk bond portfolio drop to $ N billion from $ N billion since august because of falling junk prices 
 we certainly do have a lack of liquidity here and it 's something to be concerned about says james a. <unk> a managing director 
 i have no reason to think things will get worse but this market has a <unk> for surprising us 
 this market teaches us to be <unk> 
 the junk market 's yield <unk> are learning a real painful lesson he says 
 although the majority of junk bonds outstanding show no signs of default the market has downgraded many junk issues as if they were in trouble says stuart <unk> manager of aetna life & casualty insurance co. 's $ N billion investment-grade public bond portfolio 
 but we think the risks are there for things getting a lot worse 
 and the risks are n't appropriate for us he says 
 the big insurer unlike prudential owns only about $ N million of publicly sold junk bonds 
 the string of big junk bond defaults which have been a major cause of the market 's problems this year probably will <unk> some analysts say 
 if anything we 're going to see defaults increase because credit ratings have declined says paul <unk> associate professor at the massachusetts institute of technology 's sloan school of management 
 mr. <unk> whose study on junk bond defaults caused a furor on wall street when it was disclosed last april says this year 's junk bond defaults already show a high <unk> with his own findings 
 his study showed that junk bonds over time had a cumulative default rate of N N 
 one indication of a growing number of junk defaults mr. <unk> says is that about half of the $ N billion of corporate bonds outstanding that have been lowered to a default rating by s&p this year are junk bonds sold during the market 's big issue years of N through N 
 these bonds now rated <unk> include junk offerings by <unk> industries columbia savings colorado first texas savings association <unk> financial corp. integrated resources inc. metropolitan broadcasting corp. resorts international inc. southmark corp. and <unk> inc 
 obviously we got a lot more smoke than fire from the people who told us the market was n't so risky says bradford cornell professor of finance at university of california 's anderson graduate school of management in los angeles 
 mr. cornell has just completed a study that finds that the risks and returns of junk bonds are less than on common stocks but more than on investment-grade bonds 
 mr. cornell says the junk market is no <unk> as drexel claimed but it also is n't a disaster as the <unk> say 
 despite the junk market 's problems drexel continues to enjoy a loyalty among junk bond investors that its wall street rivals have n't found 
 during the past three weeks for example drexel has sold $ N billion of new junk bonds for turner broadcasting co. uniroyal chemical continental air and duff & phelps 
 still the list of troubled drexel bond offerings <unk> that of any firm on wall street as does its successful offerings 
 troubled <unk> issues include resorts international <unk> integrated resources sci tv gillette holdings western electric and southmark 
 quality junk bonds will continue to trade well says michael <unk> chairman of salomon brothers asset management inc 
 but the deals that never should have been brought have now become nuclear waste

 like which are <unk> and which are not 
 with the fall social season well under way <unk> are out in force trying to <unk> their <unk> and sometimes put down their <unk>

 in case you have forgotten his name was rudolph <unk> 
 name-dropping is pervasive and getting more so as society becomes more complex and <unk> says herbert <unk> a new york <unk> with a <unk> <unk> 
 it can be an avenue of <unk> to a certain sector of society 
 it provides some people a needed sense of <unk> and can help open up a conversation with someone you do n't know 
 like the long island <unk> in the theater district the other day who <unk> to a <unk> that she once met <unk> <unk> 
 i was having a drink in <unk> 's when all of a sudden i saw a woman 's <unk> coming up the steps on the second floor and she was wearing <unk> <unk> 
 i knew it was someone important so i followed her into the <unk> room and sure enough it was <unk> 
 so i said <unk> 
 and she said <unk> 
 can you imagine 
 <unk> said <unk> to me 
 some people must drop names call it an <unk> <unk>

 <unk> <unk> a new york writer who changed his name from william stretch in N is an <unk> <unk> 
 i do it <unk> and <unk> and while it may occasionally get me into trouble it 's also gotten me access to parties and society he says 
 name-dropping recently helped mr. <unk> crash a party fame magazine threw for N of the N people mentioned in the <unk> of the late andy <unk> 
 i guess i might have asked <unk> to leave but he drops so many good names we decided to let him stay says steven greenberg publisher of fame 
 after all <unk> was the ultimate <unk> dropping five a day in his <unk> 
 and <unk> was mentioned twice although very briefly and in passing 
 mr. <unk> says that at the party he <unk> to malcolm <unk> publisher of <unk> magazine <unk> been in the columns together mary boone a new york art dealer i think she knows me but i 'm not sure and <unk> <unk> the actress she knows me but we 're not really the best of friends 
 mr. <unk> the <unk> columnist says there are people who actually plan whose names they are going to drop before attending a party 
 these <unk> do n't <unk> only their <unk> with the <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> mosbacher 
 they even drop <unk> names like <unk> <unk> whom everybody these days apparently has heard of but no one really knows says mr. <unk> 
 it 's the <unk> of name-dropping that counts 
 but name-dropping has other benefits often civic 
 in the name of civic pride and from the desire to <unk> a negative image some city <unk> seek to link their <unk> with the most <unk> names the city has to offer 
 take cleveland 
 it has gotten a bad rep because its once heavily <unk> <unk> river caught fire because former mayor ralph <unk> set his hair on fire with an <unk> <unk> and because its proposed rock <unk> roll hall of fame was recently refused an <unk> grant 
 some people call it the mistake on the lake lake <unk> that is 
 it helps to point out how many important people came through cleveland on their way to the top says george miller executive director of the new cleveland campaign a nonprofit organization devoted to citing the city 's strengths 
 mr. miller notes that actor paul <unk> 's family owned a <unk> store in cleveland that the late actress margaret hamilton who played the bad <unk> in the <unk> of <unk> once ran a <unk> school in cleveland and that <unk> bob hope 's father a <unk> once worked on a church next to <unk> hall cleveland 's main concert hall

 mr. <unk> says that a <unk> property <unk> the san fernando valley is priced at $ N million because the late actor <unk> <unk> once lived there

 americans now can choose among N different models of cars vans and trucks up from just N when the decade began according to automotive news a trade publication 
 for car marketers it has become a much tougher battle to keep loyal customers from <unk> to one of the new makes on the block 
 for american car buyers the proliferation of choice is both <unk> and confusing 
 malcolm <unk> vice chairman of the jordan <unk> case & taylor advertising agency in new york calls the proliferation <unk> mania 
 he says the number of automobile choices is causing stress among consumers today and that people will simply ignore new models that lack a <unk> image 
 the winners he predicts will be brands from car makers that have traditionally been associated with quality and value 
 he says it 's important for a new make to be as distinctive as possible while still retaining links to the parent company 's quality image 
 he <unk> toyota and nissan motor co. for creating separate divisions for their new luxury models rather than simply adding more <unk> to their standard car lines 
 some auto executives believe the benefits of more choice outweigh the <unk> 
 there 's more noise out there and the consumer may have to work harder to cut through it says vincent p. <unk> executive director of market research and planning at general motors corp

 just four years ago gm planners divided the combined car and truck market into seven segments 
 today they identify N distinct segments for cars and another N for trucks and vans 
 the number of makes has <unk> because the u.s. is the world 's biggest and <unk> market for automobiles virtually every auto maker wants to sell here

 the wall street journal 's american way of buying survey found that N N of today 's car buyers tend to switch brands 
 for the survey peter d. hart research associates and the roper organization each asked about N u.s. consumers about their buying habits 
 which cars do americans favor most these days 
 it 's hard to <unk> but age seems to be the best <unk> 
 adults under age N like sports cars luxury cars <unk> and imports far more than their elders do 
 three of every N buyers under N would prefer to buy a sports car compared with just N N of adults N and over according to the journal survey 
 young consumers prefer luxury cars by a N N to N N margin even though older buyers because of their incomes are more likely to actually purchase a luxury car 
 perhaps most striking N N of households headed by people aged N to N have at least one foreign car 
 that 's true of only N N of households headed by someone N or older 
 generally imports appeal most to americans who live in the west and are <unk> affluent and especially young

 both features appealed most to buyers under N 
 in contrast <unk> computers power seats and <unk> engines had little appeal

 program trading amounted to N N of average daily volume in june 
 the big board says program trading describes a variety of strategies involving the purchase or sale of a basket of N or more stocks 
 the most controversial of these is stock-index arbitrage in which traders buy or sell baskets of stocks and offset the position with an opposite trade in stock-index futures to lock in profits 
 it 's the most controversial form of program trading because it can create abrupt price swings in the stock market 
 salomon brothers inc. was the top program trader in september but most of the firm 's activity involved portfolio trading strategies other than stock-index arbitrage

 the complaint filed in federal district court <unk> imperial and other defendants of issuing false and misleading financial data 
 it also charges that imperial the holding company for imperial savings & loan experienced major losses and <unk> because of improper assessment of the risks of junk-bond investments and wholesale consumer loan packages 
 the suit seeks unspecified damages 
 imperial is in the midst of reducing its junk-bond holdings and getting out of the investment banking business in order to return to traditional thrift activities 
 the derivative suit is similar to a class-action complaint filed earlier this year 
 imperial said in a statement it expects other complaints to be filed in the wake of the original suit and a recent article in barron 's magazine that focused on the company 's problems 
 although an imperial spokesman said the company had n't yet been served with the derivative suit he reiterated the company 's statement that it would vigorously defend itself against the class-action suit 
 spokesmen at drexel and first executive said the companies had n't yet been served with the suit 
 in a separate complaint also filed in federal court here shareholder max <unk> of new york charged imperial its top executives and directors with breach of fiduciary duty and <unk> the company 's assets

 eastman kodak co. seeking to position itself in the potentially huge high-definition television market unveiled a <unk> that can transform conventional <unk> film into high-definition video 
 the move also helps the rochester n.y. photographic giant ensure that its <unk> film business for which it holds a <unk> monopoly supplying every hollywood movie company is n't made <unk> by the <unk> hdtv business 
 while the prototype <unk> is costly it 's being <unk> by the <unk> hdtv industry as a way of increasing the number of high-quality shows that can be seen on the new medium 
 the industry has been waiting with <unk> breath for the machines to come along says david <unk> president of <unk> <unk> five productions inc. a new york pioneer in high-definition programming 
 he notes that industry executives have until now worried that they would face a severe shortage of programs once consumers begin replacing their tv sets with <unk> 
 japanese electronic giants such as sony corp. and hitachi ltd. have focused almost entirely on hdtv hardware and virtually ignored software or programs shot in high-definition 
 and only a handful of small u.s. companies are engaged in high-definition software development 
 it 's estimated that just about N hours of <unk> programming is currently available for airing 
 kodak says its new <unk> hdtv <unk> will help alleviate the problem by allowing programmers and broadcasters to convert movies and television programs shot in <unk> <unk> film into high-definition video 
 consumers will be able to switch on their hdtv sets and get all the <unk> benefits the high-tech medium offers 
 otherwise they 'd be watching programs that are no different in quality from what they currently view on color tvs 
 it would be like watching a black and white movie on a color tv set says malcolm g. <unk> chairman of the film and video department at the rochester institute of technology 
 the new <unk> are a critical link between film and the television <unk> says <unk> d. <unk> vice president and general manager of kodak 's motion picture and <unk> products division 
 kodak wo n't disclose the cost or when its <unk> will be on the market but it 's estimated the machine may be available within two years 
 a similar machine already on the market made by rank <unk> ltd. a unit of rank <unk> costs about $ N 
 and the potential market is tremendous industry experts say 
 if hdtv takes off in the u.s. there will be demand for some N to N hdtv <unk> known in the industry as <unk> 
 demand will come first from programming production companies and then from television stations 
 the <unk> is head and <unk> above anything else i 've seen says richard j. <unk> vice president engineering and development at mca inc. 's universal city studios 
 and mr. <unk> the program producer contends that kodak 's move is a sound marketing decision 
 they ca n't afford to stay out of hdtv 
 indeed the stakes are high 
 the u.s. electronics industry estimates that the hdtv market will total about $ N billion over the next two decades with an additional $ N billion expected to go for related products 
 <unk> break down images into more than N lines compared with N for today 's <unk> providing considerably sharper detail 
 and the sets are wider <unk> the <unk> of a movie screen 
 but the financial rewards are n't expected soon nor are they guaranteed 
 experts estimate the first sets of <unk> wo n't be available for another five to N years and will probably retail for more than $ N each in today 's dollars 
 some critics say they wo n't be quickly embraced by consumers because of the high price 
 nevertheless kodak could n't risk letting hdtv turn its <unk> film business into a <unk> 
 kodak understands hdtv is where everybody is going says <unk> 's mr. <unk> 
 yet another political scandal is <unk> japan 
 but this time it 's hurting opposition as well as <unk> members 
 and as it <unk> it 's <unk> some of the more <unk> and <unk> aspects of japanese society 
 already ruling liberal democratic party demands that opposition members testify under <unk> in parliament have stalled one budget committee session and forced the committee to plan a special two-day investigation at the end of the month 
 but the scandal itself is so <unk> that <unk> members are divided between those who want to pursue the matter in hope of <unk> the opposition and those who favor leaving well enough alone 
 the opposition can be the most hurt because everyone already figures the ldp is that kind of <unk> says <unk> <unk> former aide to ldp <unk> <unk> <unk> and now an independent analyst 
 but he adds we ca n't tell where it will go at all because we 're still in the middle of it 
 this time the scandal centers on donations made by the <unk> pachinko <unk> industry 
 pachinko a kind of <unk> is japan 's favorite form of legal gambling 
 the donations so far appear to be small especially compared with the huge sums that changed hands in the recruit co <unk> scandal that plagued the ruling party last year 
 but the implications could be great 
 pachinko is slightly on the <unk> side often linked to the lower ranks of japan 's <unk> and regularly at the top of annual lists of tax <unk> 
 recently the industry has faced the threat of new restrictions and political donations may have been made with the intent to bribe 
 also about N N of pachinko <unk> owners are korean many of whom maintain close ties with north or south korean residents ' organizations and donations by such foreign groups are illegal in japan 
 to many japanese pachinko is benign or <unk> <unk> 
 <unk> <unk> pachinko <unk> <unk> from the main streets and narrow <unk> of cities and towns across the country 
 <unk> pass hours watching the lights <unk> and listening to the metal balls <unk> as much to gamble as to get a little time to be <unk> alone with their thoughts 
 at N yen $ N for a handful of balls pachinko is a common <unk> and has been since it took root as cheap entertainment in the years after world war ii 
 but the total of all those <unk> balls has created an industry with a reported annual income of N trillion yen almost $ N billion or nearly the size of japan 's <unk> automobile industry 
 and because the pachinko industry is regularly at the top of annual lists for tax evasion some observers estimate the real income could be as much as N trillion yen 
 if that money were being taxed it could bring the government a badly needed several trillion yen 
 in N an attempt was made to crack down on the industry with tougher restrictions 
 then in N a proposal to keep better track of income by selling prepaid cards for pachinko was <unk> in parliament 
 the proposal split the industry in two along the lines of national <unk> north koreans oppose the plan while south koreans japanese and taiwanese accept it or are neutral 
 in august a conservative weekly magazine reported that a pachinko industry organization donated money to japan socialist party members 
 the magazine alleged that in making the donations the pachinko industry may have been offering <unk> to win support in the battle against prepaid cards or it may have been laundering money back and forth between the <unk> and the north korean residents ' organization the chosen <unk> 
 the chosen <unk> and the <unk> immediately denied the report 
 and at first neither the opposition nor the ldp wanted to pursue the issue 
 but the press kept it alive as with the recruit scandal lists began circulating with names of people who had received money 
 within a matter of weeks <unk> magazines reported that members of the ruling ldp had received much larger donations from pachinko organizations 
 so far though there have been no allegations that the contributions the ldp members received amounted to <unk> 
 then the two camps <unk> the <unk> reports that chosen <unk> had donated directly to <unk> members were rapidly <unk> by statements that the south korean residents ' organization had long been donating directly to ldp members 
 the <unk> admitted oct. N that its members received about eight million yen from the pachinko organization and charged ldp members with receiving N million yen $ N and other opposition parties with taking about N million yen 
 on friday the chief cabinet secretary announced that eight cabinet ministers had received five million yen from the industry including N yen $ N by prime minister <unk> <unk> 
 no one has alleged that the donations were by themselves illegal 
 direct donations from either of the residents ' organizations would be illegal because the groups are defined as foreign but both groups deny making direct donations 
 they say it s possible some of their members may be donating privately 
 the issue is further complicated because although the organizations represent korean residents those residents were largely born and raised in japan and many speak only japanese 
 that they retain korean <unk> and ties is a reflection of history their parents were shipped in as <unk> during the decades when japan occupied korea before world war ii and the discrimination that still faces koreans in japanese society 
 many japanese think it only natural that the organizations or their members would <unk> to politicians the way many japanese do to win favor or support 
 both residents ' organizations admit to receiving some funding from abroad 
 but ldp members and supporters of the prepaid card idea tend to speak in <unk> about the <unk> 's alleged donations <unk> that north korean money would be more suspect than south korean because north korea is communist and south korea is an ally 
 when robert mcduffie was N he got a chance to play in the starting lineup for his high school basketball team in <unk> <unk> 
 unfortunately his mother had tickets for a recital by <unk> perlman the same night and she was <unk> about his attending 
 i threw such a fit says mr. mcduffie who had begun violin studies at the age of six 
 but once perlman started playing i did n't give a damn about basketball 
 <unk> i went home and practiced for three hours 
 today it 's obvious that the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> made the right choice 
 at N mr. mcduffie has a rich <unk> tone an <unk> <unk> precision and an increasingly busy schedule 
 he 's currently in the midst of a <unk> u.s. tour with <unk> <unk> and the warsaw <unk> with stops including charleston s.c oct. N <unk> fla oct. N tampa fla oct. N and miami oct. N 
 later this season he gives a recital at washington 's kennedy center and appears as <unk> with several major <unk> 
 yet mr. mcduffie 's career has developed at a slower pace than those of some of his better known <unk> 
 during the late 1970s he was part of a musical <unk> pack a group of <unk> <unk> who studied at the <unk> school with the noted <unk> <unk> delay 
 his violin <unk> included <unk> <unk> a <unk> of <unk> stern who performed with major <unk> while still a student <unk> lin who joined the <unk> of <unk> artists inc. at the age of N and <unk> <unk> who launched her career by winning the N <unk> competition 
 i thought i was over the hill at N recalls mr. mcduffie an <unk> man with pale blue eyes and a light southern <unk> 
 but i was n't ready for a career at that time 
 young mcduffie 's first violin teacher was <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> who taught in the <unk> public school system 
 he taught me how to play like a <unk> jokes the <unk> 
 i did n't learn to count until i got to <unk> 
 after studies at that <unk> 's <unk> division with an assistant to the legendary <unk> ivan <unk> he switched at the college level to miss delay mr. <unk> 's longtime assistant and ultimately his rival 
 i think i had to prove myself to her says mr. mcduffie 
 but she was always encouraging 
 she only put her foot down twice he continues 
 in my freshman year my <unk> was known as a party animal 
 she thought i was n't getting my practicing done 
 as the <unk> tells it his <unk> looking teacher put her hands on her <unk> <unk> her foot and said you 've just got to get the <unk> <unk> out of there 
 the second incident took place after mr. mcduffie gave an ambitious student recital and was feeling rather pleased with himself 
 miss delay requested that he come to her studio with a tape of the recital 
 we <unk> to the <unk> <unk> he recalls and she said you hear the first note that <unk> 
 that 's the only note that 's truly in tune 
 that 's the most important experience i 've had with any teacher he says because she taught me how to listen 
 now when i play with <unk> the musicians often <unk> me on my <unk> 
 it was also at <unk> that mr. mcduffie discovered his <unk> for conservative <unk> american <unk> such as david diamond and samuel barber 
 after winning a school competition with a performance of the latter 's violin <unk> mr. mcduffie was invited to play the work for the <unk> who was dying of cancer 
 barber was <unk> by the <unk> looking very pale recalls the <unk> who performed the work with a piano <unk> at the <unk> 's apartment 
 he did n't say much but what he said was important because it 's not in the score 
 there 's a beautiful <unk> <unk> he 'd kill me if he heard me say that throughout the first movement 
 the only time the violin has it is right at the end 
 it 's written <unk> in the score and i played it that way kind of <unk> 
 and he <unk> out <unk> <unk> sweet sweet 
 so we did it over he adds 
 i played very <unk> with the tip of the <unk> 
 if a <unk> is sensitive enough to bring down the <unk> volume at that point it makes the piece <unk> 
 i do n't know why barber never told anybody else 
 on <unk> stern 's recording it 's very <unk> 
 since leaving <unk> mr. mcduffie has made some smart moves and some controversial ones 
 his guest appearance on the nbc soap opera another world <unk> musical <unk> 
 by contrast he 's won <unk> for his <unk> of william <unk> 's violin <unk> which he recently recorded for <unk> along with leonard bernstein 's engaging <unk> for violin solo <unk> and <unk> 
 mr. mcduffie 's sweet tone <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> make him an ideal <unk> of both works 
 aided by the <unk> playing of the st. louis <unk> under leonard <unk> 's direction this <unk> really swings 
 mr. <unk> 's violin <unk> which sounds more like a mildly <unk> <unk> for solo violin with <unk> <unk> <unk> until the <unk> <unk> <unk> 
 but there are ample rewards in its <unk> slow sections and <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> and <unk> 
 at avery fisher hall here mr. mcduffie was heard recently with mr. <unk> and the warsaw <unk> in more conventional fare <unk> 's <unk> violin <unk> in <unk> minor 
 his performance was so <unk> and driven that the <unk> rarely <unk> 
 the <unk> <unk> played <unk> with a big <unk> sound that <unk> its size 
 whatever he plays mr. mcduffie finds satisfaction in the music itself something greater out there than me as he puts it during an interview at the manhattan apartment he shares with wife <unk> a literary <unk> 
 a normal person did not write the <unk> violin <unk> he declares 
 even when i hear it played badly i 'm still <unk> by the piece 
 if i could ever feel i 've contributed to it in some way then all the hard work has been worth it 
 ms. <unk> is a free-lance music writer in new york 
 are consumers too deep in <unk> 
 a lot of observers think so and if they 're right the whole economy as well as the <unk> among us could be hurt 
 a sudden forced <unk> by consumers who normally account for about two-thirds of economic activity would damp the economy at a time when <unk> spending is slowing and <unk> governments ca n't readily take up the slack 
 and another wave of bad loans would further <unk> many <unk> lending institutions 
 the <unk> cite some worrisome trends 
 during the almost <unk> economic expansion inflation-adjusted gross national product disposable personal income and personal consumption expenditures have risen N N but inflation-adjusted consumer installment credit has surged N N 
 and the ratio of installment debt to disposable personal income personal income after taxes has hit a high of about N N N 
 however these figures do n't seem to worry thomas a. durkin an economist at the federal reserve board 
 in a paper presented at the recent annual meeting of the national association of business economists in san francisco mr. durkin comments that installment credit always grows rapidly in cyclical advances and growth in this cycle is very typical of earlier <unk> 
 he adds we are now <unk> a slowdown which if history is a guide could <unk> for a while 
 but what about the debt burden 
 mr. durkin doubts that there is some magic level at which the ratio of installment debt to disposable income indicates economic problems 
 and more <unk> he says the debt burden measured other ways is not really in <unk> waters 
 the chart below shows why see accompanying illustration wsj oct. N N 
 the ratio of consumer installment credit to disposable income though up a bit has n't climbed <unk> and such debt as a percent of household assets is little changed 
 moreover the burden of consumer credit payments relative to disposable income may be lower in this cycle than earlier mr. durkin says 
 he notes that some revolving credit-card credit is actually convenience credit being used simply as a handy way of paying bills rather than a handy way of borrowing 
 in addition he says longer maturities on automobile and other forms of installment credit boost the stock of debt faster than the flow of <unk> and the accompanying payment burden 
 and if you consider the changing distribution of credit mr. durkin says much of the increase in debt in recent years is due to increasing credit use by <unk> families that is those probably best able to handle it 
 citing figures on home-equity loans he notes that N N of homeowners had home-equity credit accounts but the proportion rises to N N of homeowners in the $ <unk> income range and N N of homeowners with income above $ N 
 and much home-equity credit is used <unk> 
 the most frequent use is home improvement which presumably improves the value of the property mr. durkin says 
 so it is n't surprising that <unk> <unk> at banks remain as the chart shows <unk> below some earlier highs see accompanying illustration wsj oct. N N 
 a severe recession could of course raise <unk> rates but so far the current levels of consumer debt do n't seem to <unk> as a major threat 
 in fact the current weakness in auto buying and department-store sales and the gradual <unk> in the household saving rate suggest that consumers conservative as ever are already <unk> their <unk> a bit more tightly 
 in july consumer installment credit outstanding fell for the first time since january N 
 consumers appear unwilling to add to their leverage to support their spending bruce steinberg a merrill lynch economist says 
 as a result household debt appears to be stabilizing at around N N of gnp 
 consumers credit cards in hand are n't running <unk> through the shopping <unk> or putting the economy at any great risk 
 maidenform inc. <unk> to be intimate with its customers but not with the rest of the public 
 the <unk> maker of <unk> <unk> and <unk> enjoys one of the best-known brand images but its financial profile is closely <unk> by members of the founding family 
 there are very few companies that can <unk> of such a <unk> group says robert a. brawer N years old recently named president succeeding beatrice coleman his <unk> who remains chairman 
 we are a <unk> breed he <unk> 
 mrs. coleman N who declined to be interviewed is the maidenform strategist 
 sales have tripled during her <unk> tenure to about $ N million in N 
 maidenform says it is very profitable but declines to provide <unk> 
 the company sells image 
 its current ad campaign on which maidenform has spent more than $ N million since fall N does n't even show its underwear products but rather men like christopher <unk> star of the <unk> movies talking about their <unk> <unk> 
 the maidenform name is part of american pop culture says joan <unk> account supervisor of the campaign by levine <unk> <unk> & <unk> a new york ad firm 
 maidenform generated such <unk> campaigns as i <unk> i in my maidenform <unk> and the maidenform woman 
 you never know where she 'll turn up 
 <unk> on the brand is key says mr. brawer whose immediate plans include further international expansion and getting better control of distribution outside the u.s. 
 the intimate apparel industry is perceived to be a growth industry and clearly maidenform is a force to be <unk> with says david s. <unk> a special situations analyst at american securities corp. in new york 
 although working women are forced to wear the uniform of the day to retain their <unk> they are buying better quality more upscale intimate apparel he said 
 although mr. brawer 's appointment as president was long expected the move on sept. N <unk> the resignation of alan lesk as senior vice president of sales and merchandising 
 three days later mr. lesk was named president and chief executive officer of <unk> co. a competing intimate apparel division of <unk> inc 
 <unk> also owns <unk> another major intimate apparel maker 
 mr. lesk could n't be reached to comment 
 but maidenform officials say that after spending N years at maidenform mr. lesk N made it clear he wanted the top job 
 if you want the presidency of the company this is n't the firm to work for says james <unk> N who was named senior vice president of sales assuming some of the responsibilities of mr. lesk 
 the company <unk> the loss of mr. lesk and split his merchandising responsibilities among a committee of four people 
 my style is less informal mr. brawer says 
 top officers insist maidenform 's greatest strength is its family ownership 
 you ca n't go anywhere in this company and find an <unk> chart one <unk> 
 it is fun competing as a private company mr. brawer says 
 you can think long range 
 other major players in intimate apparel apparently feel the same way 
 <unk> was taken private by spectrum group in N for about $ N million 
 and last year <unk> holdings inc. went private for about $ N million 
 it was then split into <unk> apparel inc. the intimate apparel division and <unk> family products corp. which makes <unk> <unk> items and other products 
 publicly traded <unk> corp. which owns <unk> fair and <unk> lee corp. which owns <unk> co. are also strong forces in intimate apparel 
 buy-out offers for maidenform are n't <unk> says executive vice president david c. <unk> but they are n't taken very seriously 
 when he gets calls i do n't even have to <unk> with mrs. coleman mr. <unk> says 
 the company could command a good price in the market 
 over the past three and a half years apparel companies many of whom have strong brand names have been bought at about N N of sales says <unk> <unk> prudential-bache securities inc. apparel analyst 
 mr. brawer along with mrs. coleman and her daughter elizabeth an attorney who is vice chairman are the family members involved in the operations of maidenform which employs about N 
 mr. brawer 's wife <unk> and robert <unk> elizabeth 's husband round out the <unk> board 
 each has an equal vote at the monthly meetings 
 we are all very <unk> mr. brawer says 
 executives say mrs. coleman is very involved in the day-to-day operations especially product development 
 in the late 1960s she designed a <unk> stretch <unk> that boosted sales 
 her father william rosenthal designed the <unk> making company 's first <unk> in the 1920s which he said gave women a <unk> form compared with the <unk> form they got from the flat <unk> used for support at the time 
 while mr. rosenthal introduced new <unk> designs his wife <unk> concentrated on sales and other financial matters 
 the name maidenform was <unk> by a third business partner <unk> <unk> 
 the company has N plants and distribution facilities in the u.s. puerto rico other parts of the caribbean and ireland 
 maidenform products are mainly sold at department stores but the company has quietly opened a retail store of its own in omaha neb. and has N factory outlets with plans to add more 
 before joining maidenform in N mr. brawer who holds a <unk> degree in english from the university of chicago taught at the university of wisconsin

 china could <unk> its foreign-exchange reserves as early as next year a western government report says unless imports are cut drastically to help narrow the <unk> deficit 
 according to the report completed last month if china 's trade gap continues to widen at the pace seen in the first seven months of this year the reserves would be wiped out either in N or N 
 a country is considered financially healthy if its reserves cover three months of its imports 
 the $ N billion of reserves china had in june would cover just that much 
 the report by the western government which declines to be identified concludes that a near-term foreign-exchange payment problem can be avoided only if import growth drops to below N N per <unk> 
 according to chinese customs figures import growth has slowed in recent months dropping to N N in july and N N in august from the year-earlier periods compared with an average growth rate of N N in the first half 
 but before import growth slowed china 's buying spree in the first half already had taken its toll on foreign-exchange reserves 
 the $ N billion level in june marked a drop from $ N billion at the end of april 
 china 's last big import binge sent reserves tumbling to $ N billion in june N from $ N billion the previous september 
 china might <unk> off a crisis if it acts as <unk> as it did to arrest the N decline when beijing <unk> the <unk> on foreign-exchange spending and <unk> the currency 
 but this time china faces a more difficult battle because of economic forces that have come into play since the <unk> square killings june N 
 for example china 's <unk> income is expected to suffer from the big drop in tourist <unk> since june N 
 revenue from tourism this year is projected to total $ N billion down from $ N billion last year 
 because of this and the huge trade gap the deficit in china 's current account which measures trade in goods and services plus certain <unk> transfers of funds is expected to widen sharply from the $ N billion deficit last year 
 the western government report suggests a number of scenarios for china 's <unk> balance two of which are considered most likely 
 in one imports and exports continue to grow at the respective average rates of N N and N N recorded during the first seven months and the <unk> deficit widens to $ N billion 
 in N china had a record deficit of $ N billion 
 the other scenario assumes that beijing takes effective actions to curb imports in the coming months 
 in this case china would still finish the year with a <unk> deficit of $ N billion based on projections that imports for all of this year grow N N and exports N N 
 if china were still on good terms with foreign lenders it might be able to stem the drain on its foreign-exchange reserves by using some loan funds to offset the <unk> deficit 
 but since june foreign bankers led by international financial institutions have virtually suspended their new loans to china 
 even if borrowing <unk> commercial bankers are n't expected to lend as much as before 
 in addition economists are forecasting a slowdown in foreign direct investments as businessmen become increasingly wary of china 's deteriorating political and economic environment 
 on top of all this <unk> <unk> are expected to peak in N to N 
 with less capital coming in china 's balance of payments would suffer 
 the western government report 's first scenario assumes a N N reduction in foreign borrowing and a N N <unk> in foreign direct investment 
 in the second foreign borrowing is projected to grow N N and investment to drop N N 
 but in either case the report says china 's balance of payments would rapidly dry up foreign reserves which are used to finance the <unk> 
 in the first scenario the reserves would be exhausted next year and in the second they would be wiped out in N 
 <unk> holding ag parent of the swiss chemical and pharmaceutical group said its group sales rose N N in the first nine months of the year to N billion francs $ N billion 
 the company reported good gains in all of its divisions 
 <unk> also said it expects a considerable rise in N group profit from the N <unk> $ N million net in N 
 new <unk> investments inc. said it closed the acquisition of <unk> glass co. from <unk> co. a <unk> ill. maker of <unk> home products 
 terms were n't disclosed

 new <unk> investments is a closely held investment partnership with interests primarily in the packaging industry 
 ralph brown was N feet over minnesota when both jets on his falcon N <unk> out 
 at N feet he says he and his <unk> were looking for an interstate or a <unk> to land 
 at N feet the engines <unk> 
 but knowing that <unk> would probably ground him for repairs mr. brown <unk> his stop in nearby chicago and set course to get his load a few hundred <unk> to the memphis <unk> hub on time 
 had he been a little less <unk> i 'd have gotten the thing on the ground and headed for the <unk> bar mr. brown says 
 but he flies for federal express corp. perhaps the <unk> thing in corporate america to the green <unk> 
 federal 's employees work long hours and seem to <unk> on the stress of racing the <unk> 
 like mr. brown they sometimes go to surprising <unk> to meet that <unk> corporate goal delivering the goods on time 
 they are a <unk> to federal 's management which since the company 's founding N years ago has had its way with its work force an unusual feat in the contentious transportation industry 
 that may soon change 
 this month federal 's N pilots including some N acquired along with tiger international inc. in february will decide whether to <unk> the powerful air line pilots association as their bargaining agent 
 the election which would bring the first major union to federal 's u.s. operations has <unk> new <unk> against devoted veterans such as mr. brown 
 it has also rattled federal 's strongly <unk> management which is already <unk> with <unk> <unk> operations and with falling profits 
 a union sooner or later has to have an adversary and it has to have a victory frederick w. smith federal 's chairman and chief executive says with <unk> 
 in our formula we do n't have any losers except the competition 
 what managers really fear is that the <unk> movement could spread beyond the pilots 
 under federal transportation law a government mediator is attempting to <unk> the <unk> of tiger 's job <unk> into federal 's 
 depending on the outcome the merged company may face union elections this fall among <unk> <unk> <unk> workers stock <unk> and flight <unk> 
 these groups constitute up to N N of its work force 
 unions would have a <unk> effect on the whole culture of the company says bernard la <unk> a professor at ohio state university at columbus and a federal consultant 
 that culture carefully <unk> by mr. smith leaves little if any room for unions 
 since founding the company the <unk> vietnam <unk> who is still only N years old has <unk> an <unk> of combat 
 flights are <unk> 
 mr. smith 's managers have at times been called <unk> <unk> <unk> 's guerrillas 
 the <unk> <unk> award the navy <unk> for a job well done is <unk> on federal 's workers who <unk> the call of duty 
 competitors are known as the enemy 
 to reinforce employees ' <unk> mr. smith pays well 
 he also lets workers <unk> steam through an elaborate <unk> procedure and as a <unk> fly free in empty <unk> seats 
 he gives <unk> talks in periodic family <unk> <unk> internationally on <unk> the company 's own television network 
 and with many of his N workers mr. smith 's <unk> attitude has caught on 
 james cleveland a <unk> who earned a <unk> <unk> for figuring out how to get a major customer 's <unk> load to its <unk> by N a.m. considers himself far more than a <unk> 
 we do n't just hand the customer the package 
 that 's just the beginning he says 
 in <unk> we run the show 
 david <unk> a longtime pilot <unk> at the mere suggestion that a union might <unk> with his flight schedule 
 this is america he says 
 nobody has the right to tell me how much i can work 
 such attitudes have given federal flexibility not only to rapidly implement new technology but to keep its work force extraordinarily lean 
 the company deliberately <unk> stretching employees ' schedules to the limit 
 but though <unk> work as many as N hours a week during the autumn rush they leave early during slack times while still being assured of a minimum <unk> 
 pilots as well routinely fly overtime to ensure that none are <unk> during seasonal lows 
 the operational freedom has also given federal a leg up on archrival united parcel service inc. the nation 's largest employer of united <unk> of <unk> members 
 ups wo n't discuss its labor practices but according to mr. cleveland a former ups employee and others union work rules prohibit ups drivers from doing more than carrying packages between customers and their vans 
 because ups drivers are n't permitted to load their own vehicles at the <unk> say these <unk> packages often get buried in the load and are delivered late 
 labor problems are the last thing mr. smith needs right now 
 although the tiger acquisition has brought federal a long way toward becoming the global player it wants to be it also has brought problems 
 it more than doubled federal 's long-term debt to $ N billion thrust the company into unknown territory heavy cargo and suddenly expanded its landing rights to N countries from four 
 federal on its own had n't been doing very well overseas 
 it had <unk> in its attempt to get into asia where treaty restrictions forced it to fly some planes <unk> on certain routes 
 on routes to south america the company had no backup jets to ensure delivery when planes were <unk> 
 in europe business suffered as federal bought several local companies only to have the managers quit 
 these and other problems squeezed federal 's profit margins last year to N N down from more than N N annually in the first half of the decade 
 earnings have plummeted too in each of the past three quarters 
 in the fiscal first period ended aug. N profit fell N N to $ N million or N cents a share mostly because of the tiger merger federal says 
 federal 's stock price however has held up well driven in part by the general <unk> of airline stocks analysts say 
 since trading as low as $ N a share in may federal 's shares have rallied as high as $ N in new york stock exchange composite trading 
 they closed friday at $ N down N cents on the day 
 there 's a certain irony in the fact that federal express faces its first union problems as a result of its tiger purchase 
 tiger itself was founded by a band of <unk> <unk> who had <unk> supplies over the <unk> from india to china during world war ii 
 in the early 1970s mr. smith <unk> his fledgling company on tiger 's innovation of <unk> and <unk> operations 
 but from early on tiger 's workers <unk> while federal 's never have 
 federal express officials acknowledge mistakes in their drive overseas but say it will pay off eventually 
 analysts expect federal 's earnings to improve again in its fiscal third quarter ending feb. N when the company should begin benefiting from tiger 's extra flights <unk> planes and landing rights 
 until then they expect the cost of <unk> the two carriers to continue <unk> profits 
 for now the union issue is the most <unk> of federal 's tiger problems management believes 
 although encouraging dialogue between managers and workers mr. smith does n't <unk> what he considers <unk> 
 when a large group of pilots once signed <unk> opposing <unk> and compensation changes he called a meeting in a company <unk> and dressed them down for challenging his authority 
 he then made most of the changes pilots say 
 that sort of approach however has n't worked since the addition of tiger 
 its N workers who had battled tiger 's management for years over <unk> were union members until the day of the merger when most of their unions were automatically <unk> 
 soon after the merger moreover federal 's management asked tiger 's pilots to sign an agreement <unk> that they could be fired any time without cause or notice 
 when the pilots refused the company <unk> it 
 mr. smith angered federal 's pilots too 
 in his <unk> to seal the deal with tiger chairman saul steinberg last august mr. smith ignored a promise that he had made to his own pilots three years ago that any <unk> acquired in future mergers would be <unk> put at the bottom of the pilot seniority list that <unk> work schedules pay and career options 
 the tiger merger agreement <unk> that the lists be combined on the basis of tenure 
 mr. smith is trying hard to <unk> the anger 
 and even some <unk> pilots say his <unk> and popularity among the many former military <unk> could be tough to beat 
 a lot of people are identifying a vote for representation as a vote against fred smith says <unk> <unk> a <unk> pilot and union activist 
 mr. smith and other top federal executives have met with tiger workers in los angeles ohio new york alaska asia and europe 
 recently they have appeared every few weeks in <unk> type <unk> <unk> <unk> arguments 
 in one video mr. smith defended his agreement to merge the <unk> lists 
 he said mr. steinberg had insisted that the merger talks move quickly 
 regulators as well might have <unk> the deal if tiger 's pilots had n't been protected he said 
 furthermore mr. smith added our contract with our pilots says that we will manage our fleet operations with their advice 
 it does n't give any particular group the ability to veto change 
 already the fight has been costly 
 the <unk> controversy along with the <unk> dispute has been turned over to the mediator 
 meanwhile the company is operating with two separate pilot groups and seniority lists and that is costing federal a big number says james <unk> executive vice president and chief operating officer 
 the issue has also cost federal management a lot of good will among its old pilots 
 they were willing to <unk> us because we had n't shown any <unk> any resistance says william <unk> a <unk> pilot and <unk> federal veteran 
 adds john <unk> a N <unk> and past chairman of the <unk> flight advisory board they 've made all these <unk> gestures to the flying tiger pilots and for us nothing 
 such <unk> could prove <unk> in the union vote 
 a large majority of the N former tiger <unk> support the union according to a union study 
 but though most of the N federal pilots are believed opposed it is unclear just how much their loyalty to mr. smith has been eroded 
 the fight has turned <unk> and among pilots at least has shattered the <unk> de corps that mr. smith worked so hard to build 
 <unk> pilots have held <unk> parties 
 some younger pilots say they have had to endure <unk> <unk> by senior pilots while flying across the country 
 and for now at least the competition is n't the only enemy 
 barney <unk> a N <unk> and leader of the <unk> forces said he has received two <unk> death threats and been challenged to a fight with tire <unk> by a <unk> 
 the pilots are either for us or extremely against us he says with a sigh 
 <unk> corp. said it obtained a $ N million export order for <unk> recovery vehicles and related support equipment 
 <unk> declined to say what country placed the order 
 the company said it received an order for N of the vehicles which retrieve tanks and other <unk> vehicles when they break down or are damaged and an option for N more 
 delivery is to begin in early N 
 <unk> produces products for defense industrial commercial and construction markets 
 the senate convicted u.s. district judge <unk> hastings of florida of eight impeachment articles removing the <unk> judge from his $ <unk> lifetime job 
 mr. hastings 's case was particularly <unk> because it marked the first time a federal official was <unk> and removed from office on charges of which a jury had acquitted him 
 in N mr. hastings was found not guilty of accepting a $ N bribe in a case before him the central charge on which the senate convicted him 
 he was only the sixth federal judge ever ousted from office after an impeachment trial 
 with no floor debate the senate on friday voted N to <unk> mr. hastings of perjury and conspiring to accept a bribe five votes more than needed 
 conviction on any single impeachment article was enough to remove judge hastings from office 
 he was found not guilty of three charges involving accusations that he had improperly disclosed information about a sensitive government investigation 
 the senate did n't vote on six lesser charges 
 although mr. hastings had been acquitted by a jury lawmakers handling the prosecution in congress had argued that the purpose of impeachment is n't to punish an individual 
 instead they argued that impeachment aims to protect public institutions from people who have abused their positions of trust <unk> of the outcome of prior criminal or civil cases 
 mr. hastings faced the senators and sat <unk> during the first two <unk> votes then quickly left the chamber 
 in an <unk> news conference on the capitol steps he denounced the senators ' action 
 their opinion is <unk> of the wisdom of the <unk> ' teaching regarding impeachment mr. hastings said 
 for the future he said he would run for governor of florida 
 mr. hastings was appointed to the federal bench by president carter in N and was one of the few black federal judges in the country 
 while he packed the senate gallery with his supporters during some of the impeachment trial most civil rights groups kept their distance from his case 
 following the impeachment conviction dr. benjamin <unk> executive director of the national association for the <unk> of <unk> people issued a <unk> statement warning that the hastings case could set a dangerous precedent but adding we must respect the considered judgment of the senate 
 when last we left him fbi agent <unk> mancuso had solved a murder mystery unraveled a washington political scandal and racked up some pretty good ratings numbers in the <unk> favorite son 
 what next for the <unk> fbi agent with the heart of gold

 there are plenty of worse <unk> for shows and most of them had already made the fall lineup

 week by week on mancuso fbi nbc <unk> N p.m <unk> he <unk> around the crime styles of the rich famous and powerful of the washington scene a loose <unk> on deck at the fbi

 the opening show featured a secretary of defense <unk> accused of <unk> a la john tower 
 when his secretary is found floating dead in the <unk> 's pool mancuso is called in to investigate

 if all of this seems a little <unk> it 's redeemed in part by some tricky plot <unk> 
 the usual suspects are found to be guilty then not guilty then guilty but of a different crime 
 in last week 's rape case for example the girl turns out to have been a victim of incest and the biggest <unk> are the politicians who exploit the case 
 most of all though the show is redeemed by the character of mancuso 
 what makes the veteran fbi man so <unk> is his <unk> <unk> earned we discover when he was assigned to the civil rights movement back in the 1960s 
 he was n't protecting the freedom <unk> he was <unk> them as <unk> 
 this is not the mississippi burning scenario that <unk> his young colleagues kid you 've been reading classic <unk> too long mancuso says 
 back in N the fbi had five black agents 
 three were <unk> for j. edgar <unk> and two <unk> his house 
 at the core of mr. <unk> 's mancuso is his <unk> <unk> 
 he describes a reporter as miss first amendment 
 he describes a <unk> <unk> as <unk> williams 
 and when he 's told try a little <unk> he <unk> back i 'm going home to try a little <unk> 
 yet for all his <unk> he 's at heart a <unk> <unk> a <unk> with a secret crush on truth justice and the american way 
 he 's the kind of guy who <unk> <unk> flags 
 if mancuso fbi has an intriguing central character it also has a major flaw 
 it 's wildly <unk> 
 executive producers steve sohmer and jeff <unk> and <unk> ken <unk> and steve <unk> have <unk> this show up to the breaking point 
 to start there 's always a crisis and someone always worries what if the press gets a hold of this 
 at least once an episode we see <unk> <unk> around <unk> <unk> 
 at least once mancuso 's boss <unk> in here now and proceeds to dress his investigator down 
 you are a <unk> a <unk> in a $ N suit 
 one more word and you are out on a park bench <unk> 
 finally of course the boss gives in but he 's still <unk> i find myself explaining anything to teddy kennedy you 'll be chasing stolen cars in <unk> 
 in fact throughout mancuso fbi we do n't get words or lines we get <unk> 
 witnesses <unk> <unk> <unk> a dream that the planet could be saved from itself and from the <unk> <unk> creatures who try to <unk> down every decent man who raises his voice 
 and mancuso himself is investigating at the top of his <unk> how the hell can you live with yourself he <unk> at a politician 
 you twist people 's trust 
 you built your career on <unk> and hate 
 the <unk> will be here years after the polls close 
 in each show mancuso gets to <unk> similar <unk> 
 where the hell are they <unk> <unk> live when people like you turn the world into a big toxic waste dump 
 you 're the real criminal here and what you did was n't just a murder it was a crime against <unk> 
 and at least once a show someone <unk> the line get off that <unk> 
 now that 's advice the writers should take to heart 
 they have a series with a good character some interesting even occasionally surprising plot lines and they 're <unk> it 
 why when a key witness disappears does mancuso trash her apartment <unk> down <unk> <unk> walls 
 it 's a bizarre and totally inappropriate reaction all to add more <unk> to a script that 's already <unk> on <unk> 
 that 's not plot 
 that 's not character 
 that 's <unk> 
 there is a scene at the end of the first week 's show where mancuso <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> to his dead partner david 
 asked to say a few words he pulls out his <unk> piece of paper and tries to talk but he 's too <unk> up to get the words out 
 he <unk> on the piece of paper in frustration then turns and walks away 
 it was a <unk> moving moment for series television and robert <unk> 's acting <unk> in the <unk> 
 there 's a pretty good program inside all the noise of mancuso fbi 
 if the show 's <unk> could just let themselves be quiet for a little they might just hear it 
 with a twist of the <unk> boys with tops and <unk> <unk> and <unk> types with <unk> in their <unk> have a goal in common all of them try to put the right spin on it

 texaco inc. has purchased an <unk> company in texas for $ N million its first major acquisition since its legal <unk> with pennzoil co. began more than four years ago 
 the white plains n.y. oil company said friday that it had acquired <unk> production corp. a subsidiary of <unk> energy holdings inc. for $ N million in cash with the rest to be paid in shares of a new <unk> issue of preferred stock 
 <unk> which holds properties in N oil and gas fields in south texas will provide texaco with mostly gas reserves 
 the fields contain <unk> reserves of N billion cubic feet of natural gas and four million barrels of oil 
 this acquisition is another indication of texaco 's commitment to increase the company 's reserve base said chief executive officer james w. <unk> 
 texaco has also been attempting to sell oil properties 
 at least two years ago the company put N million barrels of oil reserves on the block 
 they were either too small or <unk> to maintain the company said 
 not all of those <unk> have yet been sold 
 texaco acquired <unk> before it completed those sales because <unk> 's properties are high quality and near other fields texaco already owns a company spokeswoman said 
 texaco like many other oil companies has been struggling to replace its falling oil and gas reserves 
 texaco 's situation had become particularly complex because much of its effort had for years been focused on its <unk> with pennzoil and then on new york investor carl c. icahn 's attempt to take over the company 
 pennzoil had sued texaco for improperly <unk> with its acquisition of a portion of <unk> oil co 
 eventually texaco which was forced into bankruptcy proceedings by that litigation settled its fight with pennzoil for $ N billion in N 
 mr. icahn who played a key role in the settlement and attempted subsequently to take control of the company sold his stake in texaco just last summer 
 completion of texaco 's acquisition of <unk> is subject to government approval under the hart-scott-rodino antitrust improvements act 
 <unk> inc. said it reduced the estimated cash distribution for its capital housing and mortgage partners inc. trust to between N cents and N cents a share from between N cents and N cents for the year ending june N N 
 the change in expected cash distributions from the <unk> real estate investment trust stems from a revised estimate of administrative costs said jay r. cohen <unk> executive vice president 
 <unk> which sponsors <unk> is a world-wide real estate investment firm 
 h&r block inc. had net income of $ N million or $ N a share in the fiscal year ended april N

 <unk> ag 's chairman said the belgian insurer is prepared to give up some of its independence to a white knight if necessary to <unk> a raider 
 amid heavy buying of shares in belgium 's largest insurer maurice <unk> also warned in an interview that a white knight in buying out a raider could leave speculators with big losses on their ag stock 
 since the beginning of the year the stock has nearly doubled giving ag a market value of about N billion belgian francs $ N billion 
 the most likely white knight would be societe generale de <unk> s.a. which already owns N N of ag and which itself is controlled by cie financiere de suez the <unk> french financial conglomerate 
 but mr. <unk> said a rescue also could involve <unk> mutual life insurance co. which owns N N of ag 
 ag is hardly alone in its anxiety

 in france suez and <unk> assurances s.a. both have been on the <unk> for giant acquisitions suez last month acquired control of <unk> <unk> the <unk> european insurance company after a takeover battle with cie <unk> 
 mr. <unk> said the volume of shares changing hands has grown significantly since <unk> 
 but he estimated that a raider would have been able to <unk> no more than N N of the shares in recent months 
 aside from exploring plans for joint ventures or acquisitions mr. <unk> has called top managers of companies rumored as potential raiders among them <unk> union des assurances de paris and suez all based in france 
 they have all very clearly stated that they have not acquired and are not acquiring shares of ag he said 
 any raider would find it hard to crack ag 's <unk> 
 a syndicate of shareholders holds just under N N of ag mr. <unk> said and members have agreed to give one another the right of first refusal should they sell any ag shares 
 aside from generale de <unk> and <unk> the syndicate includes <unk> <unk> a belgian savings bank and various family interests 
 a generale spokesman confirmed that the giant belgian holding company would be willing to raise its stake in ag should a raider seek control 
 <unk> officials could n't be reached for comment 
 even without bid talk this year 's surge in prices for brussels real estate has excited interest in ag 
 the company says those holdings constitute the <unk> real-estate portfolio in belgium 
 with the dust settling from the failed coup attempt in panama one of the many <unk> questions the bush administration will <unk> is this is the national security council staff big enough and does it have enough clout to do its job of <unk> foreign policy 
 president bush 's national security adviser <unk> gen. <unk> scowcroft came into office in january intent on making the nsc staff <unk> and more disciplined than it had been during the reagan administration 
 gen. scowcroft was a member of the tower commission which investigated the iran-contra affair 
 he was all too aware of how a large <unk> <unk> nsc staff had spun out of control and nearly <unk> president reagan 's second term 
 so following both the style he pursued as president ford 's national security adviser and the recommendations of the tower commission gen. scowcroft has <unk> the nsc staff and tried to ensure that it <unk> to its assigned tasks namely gathering the views of the state department pentagon and intelligence community serving as an honest broker in <unk> that information for the president and then making sure presidential decisions are carried out 
 the tower commission specifically said that the nsc staff should be small and warned against letting energetic <unk> like <unk> col. oliver north strike out on their own rather than leaving the day-to-day execution of policies to the state department pentagon or central intelligence agency 
 however the panama episode has raised questions about whether the nsc staff is sufficiently big diverse and powerful to coordinate u.s. policy on tough issues 
 during the coup attempt and its aftermath nsc staffers were stretched very thin says one senior administration official 
 it 's a very small shop 
 gen. scowcroft does n't plan to increase the staff right now but is weighing that possibility the official adds 
 the nsc staff does n't have the <unk> that i believe is required to have an effective <unk> process says frank <unk> a former pentagon aide who now runs the center for security policy a conservative washington <unk> 
 the problem with this administration i think is that by design it has greatly diminished both in a physical sense and in a procedural sense the role of the nsc 
 the national security council itself was established in N because policy makers <unk> a need in an increasingly complex world for a formal system within the white house to make sure that communications <unk> smoothly between the president and the state department pentagon and intelligence agencies 
 by law the council includes the president vice president and secretaries of state and defense 
 in practice the director of central intelligence and chairman of the joint chiefs of staff also serve as <unk> members 
 but the size shape and role of the nsc staff have been left for each president and his national security adviser to decide 
 that task is one of washington 's <unk> problems 
 in the bush white house the size of the nsc 's staff of professional officers is down to about N from about N in N administration officials say 
 administration officials insist that the size of the staff was n't a problem during the panama crisis 
 but one clear problem during the coup attempt was that the nsc <unk> most experienced in latin america <unk> briggs was gone 
 he had just resigned at least in part because of a <unk> with assistant secretary of state bernard <unk> over the administration 's policy on panama and support for nicaragua 's contra rebels 
 the absence of mr. briggs underscored the possible <unk> of the current nsc staff 
 both gen. scowcroft and his deputy robert gates are experts in u.s.-soviet affairs 
 gen. scowcroft is particularly <unk> in arms control and mr. gates has spent years studying soviet politics and society 
 both have become <unk> of president bush 
 but neither has an extensive background in latin america the middle east or asia 
 in those areas the role of nsc staffers under them therefore have become more important 
 gen. scowcroft knows as well as anyone that one of the biggest dangers he faces is that nsc staffers working in relative <unk> will take over <unk> and operational tasks that are best left to bigger and more experienced state department and pentagon bureaus 
 but just as every previous nsc adviser has gen. scowcroft now will have to <unk> at what point the nsc staff becomes too lean and too <unk>

 frank lavelle who at the time was the marketing director for sperry in <unk> fla. admitted participating in a scheme to bribe <unk> <unk> the navy official 
 mr. <unk> who left the navy in N pleaded guilty earlier this year to related conspiracy bribery and <unk> charges 
 the bribery scheme took place between N and N according to documents filed by prosecutors in connection with mr. lavelle 's guilty plea in federal district court in <unk> va 
 sperry merged with <unk> corp. to become unisys corp. in late N 
 court documents filed by prosecutors indicate mr. <unk> tried to steer to sperry a <unk> dollar contract to <unk> maintenance of certain navy electronics <unk> 
 mr. <unk> among other things illegally provided mr. lavelle with inside information and documents intended to give sperry an unfair advantage in the competition the documents said 
 sperry ultimately was eliminated from the competition without receiving the work 
 documents filed by prosecutors also indicate that mr. lavelle and his fellow <unk> requested and obtained approval of the scheme from <unk> sperry officials because the payment which <unk> <unk> requested was so large 
 charles <unk> a former unisys vice president and james neal a former company consultant have admitted participating in this and other bribery schemes

 he <unk> the contest on larry king 's radio show on pat <unk> 's television show and on the <unk> cable television network 
 he talked about it in every speech he made as he <unk> the country promoting his books which <unk> handy <unk> advice on using government information for fun and profit 
 mr. lesko figured he would be flooded with <unk> by now 
 after all he says we 've got like N million bureaucrats 
 and in addition to the $ N he has promised the winner a my favorite bureaucrat <unk> and offered each of two <unk> $ N 
 so far though mr. lesko has received only one entry 
 to make matters worse the lone nomination came from another bureaucrat a woman from the new york state department of taxation and finance who <unk> her boss 
 mr. lesko who is making the rules as he goes has determined that bureaucrats are eligible for nomination by other bureaucrats 
 but he says he would prefer to get <unk> from <unk> folks 
 he admits that he has n't had much luck generating free publicity for his contest 
 newspapers including this one have generally ignored his news releases 
 talk show hosts quickly change the topic 
 but mr. lesko 's staff is beginning to wonder whether there is n't some larger phenomenon <unk> the contest 
 is the government not helping anybody asks <unk> murray an assistant to mr. lesko 
 mr. lesko himself is n't yet prepared to accept that explanation 
 people hate to write he says 
 maybe people do n't believe i want to give this money away 
 maybe americans are just so <unk> with government that they are n't interested in admitting that bureaucrats come in handy once in a while 
 if he sponsored a contest on how a bureaucrat <unk> something mr. lesko admits i 'd get N <unk> 
 now there 's an idea 
 ford motor co. and saab-scania ab of sweden broke off talks about a possible alliance after ford officials concluded that the cost to modernize saab 's car operations would outweigh the likely return 
 with the collapse of the talks friday european analysts expect ford to intensify its pursuit of british luxury car maker jaguar plc which is scrambling to fend off a hostile ford bid by negotiating a friendly alliance with ford 's archrival general motors corp 
 saab meanwhile is left to continue its search for an ally to shore up its sagging car business 
 saab said last week it has had and will continue to have contacts with other manufacturers 
 among the possible suitors is italy 's fiat s.p a analysts said last week 
 ford and saab officials declined to elaborate publicly on the announcement friday that their negotiations failed to yield an agreement that could make long-term business sense to both parties 
 individuals close to the ford side of the negotiations said late last week that the no. N u.s. auto maker lost interest as it became clear that the swedish auto maker 's automotive operations had little to offer in the way of image or technology 
 ford originally had seen a saab alliance as a way to expand its presence in the european and u.s. luxury car markets 
 in addition ford and saab had discussed a possible link between their heavy truck operations 
 but the talks on a heavy truck alliance apparently did n't go far 
 some european analysts speculated that officials of saab 's highly profitable <unk> truck operation balked at <unk> any of their <unk> 
 meanwhile ford officials became convinced they could n't expect to recover the investment it would require to make saab 's cars competitive in the increasingly crowded luxury market 
 saab 's problems were underscored friday when the company announced that its car division had a N billion kronor $ N million loss during the first eight months of this year slightly worse than saab-scania had forecast in its first-half report last month 
 overall saab-scania 's pretax profit during the first eight months of the year plunged N N to N billion swedish kronor $ N million from N billion kronor $ N million a year earlier 
 industry analysts in europe said the most likely suitor for saab now is fiat 
 saab and fiat have worked together in the past in one case developing jointly a new auto <unk> that became the foundation of saab 's N model fiat 's <unk> and <unk> 's <unk> 
 last month saab-scania chief executive <unk> <unk> said his company has had talks with fiat about a broader alliance 
 but the talks yielded nothing so advanced that we needed to make a public announcement about it he said 
 as for ford analysts expect the end of the saab play will allow the u.s. auto maker to focus its resources on the <unk> struggle with gm for a stake in jaguar 
 the failure of the saab talks makes it even more crucial for ford to be <unk> in the jaguar contest said stephen reitman european auto industry analyst at <unk> & drew in london 
 ford faces an <unk> fight for jaguar however 
 jaguar executives said last week they expect to have a friendly alliance with gm <unk> up by the end of the month 
 gm meanwhile is <unk> a delegation of members of the british parliament who are <unk> the auto maker 's <unk> operations in detroit 
 a gm spokesman said the visit is n't connected to the jaguar situation 
 but ford clearly views jaguar as a prize worth fighting for since the company 's <unk> brand image would give ford a badly needed leg up in the high end of the luxury markets in both europe and the u.s. 
 last week ford encountered a setback in its effort to broaden its u.s. luxury offerings when it was forced to abandon a four-year-old effort to market its <unk> scorpio sedan in the u.s. as a luxury import under the merkur brand name 
 so despite the <unk> <unk> analysts say ford by last friday had boosted its jaguar holding to about N N of the luxury auto maker 's shares outstanding from N N early last week 
 about N million jaguar shares changed hands in active trading on london 's stock exchange friday and jaguar shares moved up N pence to N pence $ N 
 on the u.s. over-the-counter market jaguar 's american depositary receipts rose N cents to $ N

 the dallas cowboys are looking at a <unk> situation struggling to pull ahead of the atlanta <unk> 
 up in his stadium box their new and controversial owner <unk> jerry jones watches <unk> as the team <unk> up to the <unk> line 
 mr. jones takes heart 
 there in the center of the pack is <unk> <unk> <unk> the key to the cowboys ' comeback strategy 
 so key in fact that mr. jones signed him in april for $ N million over the next six years a record for a <unk> 
 he 's a genuine <unk> <unk> <unk> mr. jones 
 with three minutes left on the <unk> mr. <unk> takes the <unk> steps back and fires a <unk> pass straight into the hands of an atlanta defensive back 
 the crowd <unk> mr. jones <unk> his head the cowboys lose the game 
 a few days after that sept. N game mr. <unk> broke a finger <unk> him for weeks 
 <unk> the <unk> of professional sports 
 for mr. jones losing his <unk> temporarily was just the latest in a string of setbacks that has <unk> the dallas cowboys and this year much of the national football league 
 once fat and happy the cowboys now are losing games fans and money 
 last year the team ended up $ N million in the red on $ N million in revenue 
 it has some of the highest costs in the league 
 its attendance is off N N from six years ago 
 at the very least mr. jones who <unk> the society circuit as <unk> as his bench can take comfort in one fact these days he is n't alone 
 nearly half the owners of the N national football league teams are losing money the result of flat attendance aging stadiums and more than anything <unk> salaries for star players like mr. <unk> 
 last year the top N players on each nfl team took home an average $ N a figure comparable to baseball and higher than in basketball 
 <unk> draft picks have done even better average salaries and bonuses for them rose to $ N this year up N N from N 
 it 's a vicious circle says art <unk> owner of the cleveland <unk> 
 one team pays so much and the other pays more 
 we just do n't have that kind of income stream 
 all this is causing <unk> in professional football 
 owners largely <unk> in the past are now almost desperately looking for ways to lower costs and raise revenue <unk> some revolutionary ideas in the process 
 though not intentionally the cowboys ' mr. jones has come to represent this new breed of owner 
 shortly after buying N N of the team from <unk> <unk> bright for $ N million and <unk> of the cowboys ' <unk> bottom line the <unk> mr. jones set about his own round of team cuts 
 first he <unk> <unk> tom <unk> the legendary coach who took the cowboys to five <unk> <unk> and N consecutive winning seasons 
 in dallas mr. <unk> has a standing just shy of <unk> 
 <unk> sentiment flooded the local press a crude <unk> <unk> said one writer a real <unk> said another who in the hell does he think he is wrote a third 
 for mr. jones it was just the beginning 
 he quickly cut the team 's bloated administrative staff by half shut down a <unk> dance academy and in july announced plans to sell valley ranch the team 's <unk> practice camp and the most <unk> training facility in the nfl 
 mr. jones calls the ranch the pentagon of <unk> 
 it is a <unk> of halls that <unk> film rooms elaborate <unk> and <unk> centers that testify to a richer more <unk> era 
 he likes to tell the <unk> of how he got lost on the <unk> ranch during an early visit took refuge in an office and called the front desk for help 
 i said somebody come get me 
 i 'm at extension N 
 with a new day <unk> on the sport mr. jones does n't see a place for this sort of luxury 
 it 's just not cost efficient he says 
 the place costs nearly $ N million a year to maintain 
 when he sells it he says the cowboys will move to a more practical read affordable <unk> practice field near texas stadium 
 and as for tom <unk> well in mr. jones 's mind he had played out his winning years 
 after posting losing seasons in each of the last three years the cowboys needed a change he says 
 football has long been mr. jones 's passion both on and off the field 
 an arkansas native he started at guard on the <unk> N university of arkansas team that won a national championship 
 after college he worked at his father 's insurance company in little rock and in N led an aborted attempt to buy the san diego <unk> 
 years later with cash from the sale of the insurance company he founded <unk> production corp. an oil and gas exploration company based in little rock 
 so it was n't surprising that mr. jones returned to his arkansas roots when he went looking for a replacement for mr. <unk> 
 he tapped <unk> johnson a <unk> on the N university of arkansas <unk> and the head coach at the university of miami where he led the <unk> to five winning seasons and a national championship in N 
 whatever mr. johnson 's <unk> in the hearts and minds of many dallas fans he is no tom <unk> 
 seven games and after a loss to the kansas city chiefs yesterday seven losses into the season the new cowboys are n't doing any better than the old 
 in fact the last time they played this badly was in N their opening season 
 average attendance at their games about N last year continues flat 
 mr. jones is attacking the problem on several fronts 
 he continues to <unk> the team trading <unk> running back <unk> walker to the minnesota <unk> this month for a slew of players and future draft picks 
 to try to draw more fans he has dropped <unk> ticket prices from $ N to $ N 
 but the general trend given rising costs in the league has been to raise prices and mr. jones is expected to eventually follow suit 
 it 's simple says <unk> hunt who owns the kansas city chiefs and last year raised ticket prices by $ N to an average $ N 
 if we did n't increase prices we 'd be in the red 
 mr. jones has also <unk> up his marketing staff to sell the N luxury suites <unk> texas stadium his deal with <unk> bright included operating rights for the stadium 
 the suites are <unk> have <unk> bars and <unk> <unk> and offer a clear view of the field all for a sale price of $ N to $ N million depending on their size and location 
 mr. jones has been taking prospective <unk> owners onto the field during practice to let them <unk> <unk> with players and promises those who actually buy one of the rooms an insider 's look at the team 's strategy before game time 
 the sales job seems to be paying off when he bought the team only six of the suites had been sold 
 today N have 
 gate receipts are only the cowboys ' second largest source of cash 
 the biggest is the nfl 's contract with national television for broadcast of the league 's games 
 last year the cowboys ' share of that pie came to $ N million 
 the team additionally earns between $ N million and $ N million for local radio and television broadcast rights 
 mr. jones is currently trying to jack up the price for those local rights 
 he is also trying to get more stations in mexico where the cowboys have a following to pick up the games 
 mr. jones whose <unk> voice and <unk> ways <unk> an intense businessman who works <unk> days is resigned to the hefty salaries he pays his players these days 
 he calls the contracts critical to winning in the nfl and has played his part in the bidding wars 
 besides signing mr. <unk> to a sizable contract mr. jones has agreed to pay <unk> <unk> steve <unk> $ N million over the next four years 
 this wage inflation is bleeding the nfl dry the owners contend 
 soon only large corporations will be able to afford to buy and run football teams predicts john j. <unk> jr. an investment banker with salomon brothers who handled the cowboys sale 
 to tackle the problem nfl owners have proposed setting a <unk> wage scale to try to rein in salaries 
 details of the plan which would go into effect in N are <unk> but each player would apparently be paid a base salary <unk> to his position and ability 
 bonuses would be paid based on playing time and performance 
 the nfl players association meanwhile contends that athletes are paid a wage <unk> with their ability to draw fans and that some owners are in financial trouble because of poor business management not players ' salaries 
 the owners are trying to boost profit in other ways too 
 many have launched promotions to attract new fans and are <unk> dated stadium contracts 
 most of the owners must pay up to N N of gross ticket sales for leases on stadiums they say are either too small or too old 
 in chicago for example size is the issue 
 we have the worst lease in the nfl contends michael b. <unk> the president of the chicago bears and a <unk> of george <unk> who founded the nfl 's predecessor organization 
 we 're in a <unk> area with millions of bear fans and only a small number can be <unk> 
 when the lease expires in N he says it 's got to be changed 
 this year the nfl also imposed an <unk> limit on teams going into training camp down from N in a move meant to trim payroll costs 
 and the league is trying to get more for its three-year national network contract which expires after this season 
 the current contract pays the nfl $ N billion 
 owners say they expect the league to demand a N N increase despite the fact that televised football games have had lackluster ratings 
 an nfl spokesman also says the league will probably expand its offerings to cable tv companies like espn 
 the changes have n't come easy 
 like the game of professional football the nfl organization itself is in turmoil 
 the new breed of team owner mr. jones included has been fighting the nfl bureaucracy for a greater say in league affairs and the battle has produced a form of <unk> gridlock 
 in july N nfl owners almost all of them new blocked an effort to install jim <unk> as a replacement for retiring league commissioner pete <unk> 
 mr. <unk> is perceived by some owners as a <unk> for the old guard 
 earlier this month another effort to choose a commissioner failed 
 the owners meet again tomorrow 
 for his part jerry jones says he 's in the business for the long haul and his work style seems to support that 
 he puts in busy <unk> weeks excluding game days and on one recent afternoon <unk> questions in the course of an hour from a tv producer his <unk> marketing manager a <unk> customer and a <unk> of arkansas reporters

 of course the <unk> complain about their treatment of course the <unk> feel put upon 
 but his complaint that days of rage does n't contain balanced comments from <unk> about how badly the <unk> are <unk> is irrelevant

 president bush wants the pentagon to get special treatment in coping with the across-the-board spending cuts that took effect last week 
 mr. bush asked congress to raise to $ N billion from $ N billion the amount of money defense secretary dick cheney may shift among the pentagon 's individual programs projects and activities allowing him to ease the pain that the gramm-rudman budget law was intended to <unk> 
 if the request is approved by both the house and senate mr. cheney would need only permission from the white house office of management and budget to move the money according to senate budget analysts 
 that would give the pentagon flexibility that no other federal agency has 
 it 's simply a way of making the cuts less onerous for defense than they are for domestic programs said chairman james <unk> d. <unk> of the senate budget committee who said he would oppose the request 
 that is n't consistent with the kind of discipline that gramm-rudman is supposed to impose he said 
 the president 's request did n't indicate how mr. cheney would shift the money 
 a pentagon official said the request was made to give the department maximum flexibility to deal with the cuts 
 last week budget director richard darman structured the $ N billion spending reduction half of which must come from defense to impose a little bit more discipline by applying cuts to each individual program project or activity in the budget 
 that would give agencies less ability to <unk> over things he told reporters 
 under the deficit-reduction law N N of the pentagon 's money and N N of other agencies ' money has been canceled 
 lawmakers are expected to try to restore the funds once a pending <unk> measure has been signed into law 
 rochester telephone corp. said it completed its purchase of urban telephone corp. of <unk> wis. the second-largest <unk> independent telephone company in that state 
 rochester telephone said the acquisition was made in an exchange of its common shares for all the shares of urban telephone but a price was n't disclosed 
 urban is the company 's first telephone subsidiary in wisconsin 
 since june rochester telephone signed letters of intent to purchase three other wisconsin firms 
 a bill that would permit the securities and exchange commission to monitor the financial condition of securities firms ' holding companies is facing tough opposition from some wall street firms which argue that the legislation is unnecessary 
 the legislation and other issues related to the stock market will be the focus of hearings this week by the house telecommunications and finance subcommittee and the senate securities subcommittee 
 richard breeden the new chairman of the sec has n't taken a formal position on the bill which would also require investors to disclose large trades and give the sec additional authority during market <unk> 
 however he recently told the senate banking committee that he believes the agency should have explicit authority to monitor debt levels at holding companies and affiliates of <unk> which are frequently used to issue bridge loans 
 the bridge loans are intended to provide temporary financing for acquisitions 
 since such loans are often <unk> through the sale of high-risk high-yield junk bonds the recent woes of the junk-bond market have renewed concerns among regulators about the risks associated with wall street firms issuing bridge loans 
 but some wall street executives argue that such fears are unwarranted 
 in a july N letter to the senate securities subcommittee first boston corp. argued that the fact that no retail brokerage firm failed during the N market crash demonstrates that current rules are adequate 
 first boston whose holding company cs first boston group is one of the larger issuers of bridge loans on wall street said it is also concerned that once the sec has the power to monitor holding companies it will try to regulate their activities 
 the proposal while <unk> i think can be <unk> misleading because the likely consequence would be to weaken rather than strengthen the control the sec has exercised for N years over the financial <unk> and viability of <unk> michael <unk> managing director of first boston said in an interview 
 the bill would <unk> scarce resources of the commission away from <unk> into areas which simply have no way of affecting <unk> mr. <unk> said 
 sources in the industry and on capitol hill say a compromise that would <unk> the industry while addressing the sec 's concerns may be possible 
 an aide to the senate securities subcommittee says some legislators support the concept of risk disclosure but adds nobody is <unk> to the language in the bill 
 edward o'brien president of the securities industry association said that the <unk> trade group opposes the bill as it is written but that it is hopeful a compromise can be reached to achieve the sec 's goals 
 mr. o'brien will elaborate on the <unk> 's position in testimony before the house telecommunications and finance subcommittee this week a spokesman said 
 this letter was inspired by david <unk> 's sept. N editorial-page article about <unk> <unk> man in the middle of drug trafficking 
 i 've organized a series of exchanges <unk> and other continuing projects between cuban and american artists 
 in any matters between us and the cubans there can be no <unk> consequently i 've become familiar not only with cuban art and artists but also with cuban bureaucrats and their counterparts in our own government 
 despite levels of <unk> <unk> and <unk> frustration of <unk> proportion these projects all remain in my mind valuable and well worth the effort 
 there is a simple reason for this the cuban people 
 let me immediately put limits to whatever <unk> <unk> that may intimate 
 those people to whom i refer are not some <unk> <unk> quantity they are artists critics taxi drivers <unk> even some employees of the ministry of culture all of whom share a deep belief in the original principles of the cuban revolution <unk> out in terms such as <unk> among all members of the society <unk> for education and creative expression universal rights to health and <unk> housing etc 
 in fact the generation of <unk> growing into maturity right now works with such <unk> held <unk> assumptions and such <unk> commitment to moral and ethical principles that it makes <unk> <unk> 's famous <unk> of art <unk> and revolution seem modest 
 it is on behalf of these people and out of my real respect for them that i am responding to mr. <unk> 's opinions of their country 
 the <unk> trial in july with its <unk> of deeply rooted and widespread corruption and the summary trial and execution was extremely disturbing to everyone who has ever considered himself a friend of cuba 
 however <unk> though those <unk> may have been they still provide no excuse for wholesale departures from truth 
 mr. <unk> should make <unk> among <unk> the army and the cuban people 
 they are not <unk> since they are motivated to act based on their own circumstances 
 it is <unk> to <unk> a government 's policies with the will of the people as we well know and it is even worse <unk> to merge the clearly <unk> <unk> of <unk> and the military and the state bureaucracy 
 mr. <unk> is also <unk> that mr. <unk> has resisted collaboration with u.s. officials even though by his own account that collaboration has been devised essentially as a mechanism for acts directly hostile to the cuban regime such as <unk> <unk> 
 i think it 's a little <unk> to be surprised that <unk> does n't <unk> the u.s. state department to violate the jurisdiction of the cuban government over its own territory 
 we badly need to follow fact rather than the rhetoric of conventional wisdom 
 without this basic level of attention to reality our policies on cuba will continue to be as <unk> as they have for N years 
 from my own point of view given the <unk> of <unk> creativity and warm spirit in which the cuban people <unk> we deny ourselves access to things we hold <unk> and which seem to run in such short supply these days 
 there is no rational <unk> for such behavior

 <unk> inc. recently reported third-quarter earnings which were mistakenly shown in the quarterly earnings surprises table in last tuesday 's edition to be lower than the average of analysts ' estimates

 investors <unk> out of new york city bonds in <unk> last week driving prices lower and boosting yields 
 one bond trader estimated that more than $ N million of new york city general obligation bonds were put up for sale friday alone 
 while that represents a small percentage of the city 's public debt outstanding friday 's selling followed a <unk> effort to unload the bonds by a broad spectrum of institutional and individual investors 
 i 've never seen so many new york city <unk> 's up for sale said another trader 
 every broker has blocks of every size and maturity 
 municipal bond analysts said the sell-off was triggered by concerns about the city 's financial health rumors of a $ N million bond offering coming soon and political uncertainty 
 a spokesman for the city would n't confirm the size of the bond issue but did say that a general obligation offering is in the works and should be priced sometime in the next two weeks before the november mayoral election 
 general obligation bonds are backed by the city 's overall revenues and credit 
 although many investors were aware that a bond offering was being scheduled many expected a much smaller amount of bonds to be sold 
 the fact that the city will issue such a large amount of debt was interpreted as a sign that new york 's budgetary problems are more serious than had been expected 
 new york one of the nation 's largest issuers of tax-exempt bonds sold $ N million of municipal bonds just a few weeks ago 
 there have been reports for months that the city 's economy is weakening as the october N stock market crash continues to make itself felt 
 the recent sharp stock market decline <unk> those concerns 
 meanwhile tax revenues are falling while the city 's spending needs are expanding 
 rumors <unk> last week that new york 's credit ratings single-a from moody 's investors service inc. and <unk> from standard & poor 's corp. are at risk 
 the weakness in new york city bonds follows a warning from new york state comptroller edward <unk> that the N crash seriously weakened the city 's economy 
 in a study the comptroller said the city 's glory days are over 
 mr. <unk> warned mayoral candidates to be prepared for limited options and constraints on service increases to address the city 's problems in the next few years due to the <unk> weakening in the new york city economy 
 new york city 's revised financial plan due out later this month is expected to include measures to balance the city 's $ N billion budget 
 at present analysts project a budget gap on the order of $ N million to $ N million for the fiscal year ending june N N although the city 's own budget analysts project a narrower deficit 
 mark page new york 's deputy director of finance said that investors ' concerns about the city 's financial health are unwarranted given our proven ability to manage ourselves 
 he charges the city 's critics with spreading <unk> emotional rhetoric 
 there are also questions about whether a new and <unk> mayor can manage the city through what could become a financial crisis 
 the leading <unk> for the mayoral office democrat david dinkins has been criticized recently for the way he handled his personal financial affairs 
 and the controversy has led to uncertainty about the outcome of the election 
 until last week mr. dinkins was considered a <unk> 
 the market can adjust to good news or bad news but uncertainty drives people wild said bernard b. <unk> chief executive of <unk> <unk> & co. a securities firm that specializes in the municipal market 
 until last week everyone felt certain they knew the outcome of the election 
 now there have been a number of questions raised 
 last week yields on long-term new york city general obligation bonds jumped half a percentage point 
 new york city 's N N bonds due N for example were quoted late friday at a price to yield N N compared with N N thursday 
 as the yield on new york general obligation bonds rose the bond buyer <unk> general obligation index the mostly widely followed gauge of the tax-exempt market held steady at N N in the week ended oct. N 
 qintex australia ltd. encountered another setback friday when its los angeles-based affiliate qintex entertainment inc. filed for protection under chapter N of the u.s. bankruptcy code 
 qintex entertainment also said david evans its president and chief executive and roger <unk> a director both resigned 
 neither could be reached for comment 
 earlier this month qintex australia 's $ N billion agreement to acquire mgm\/ua communications co. collapsed because of a dispute over a $ N million letter of credit the australian operator of television stations and resorts was to have supplied as security in the transaction 
 mr. evans had been the de <unk> head of mgm\/ua for months 
 qintex entertainment a producer and distributor of television programs most noted for its <unk> of the hit <unk> <unk> <unk> said it filed for chapter N protection after qintex australia failed to provide it with $ N million owed to mca inc. in connection with the distribution of the new leave it to <unk> show 
 qintex entertainment is N N owned by qintex australia and said it relies on the australian company for funding its working capital requirements 
 after the announcement of the bankruptcy filing qintex entertainment stock sank $ N in over-the-counter trading to close at $ N on heavy volume of more than N million shares 
 the stock traded as high as $ N this past summer 
 jonathan lloyd executive vice president and chief financial officer of qintex entertainment said qintex entertainment was forced to file for protection to avoid going into default under its agreement with mca 
 the $ N million payment was due oct. N and the deadline for default was oct. N 
 mr. lloyd said if qintex had defaulted it could have been required to repay $ N million in debt under its loan agreements 
 mca on friday said that as a result of qintex 's failure to make the required payment it was <unk> the distribution agreement on the new leave it to <unk> as well as other mca properties 
 qintex australia was saying as recently as last weekend that they would take care of the situation 
 they continued to represent that to the board said mr. lloyd 
 we were <unk> they would stand behind the company 
 mr. lloyd said both qintex entertainment and qintex australia had attempted to secure a loan that would allow the company to make the $ N million payment but the request was turned down by an unidentified lender on oct. N 
 at that point he said qintex australia stated it would <unk> to arrange the financing 
 however a qintex australia spokesman said his firm had never promised or guaranteed to make the payment 
 in a prepared statement from australia the company also said that following the breakdown of the mgm talks it had been <unk> its position as a significant shareholder and a substantial creditor of qintex entertainment and had resolved to minimize the degree of further loans to qintex entertainment in excess of that previously made 
 the qintex australia spokesman added that his company had opposed the chapter N filing 
 he said the company believed qintex entertainment 's financial problems could have been resolved by other means 
 the report of the bankruptcy filing stunned hollywood executives and investors 
 it 's a <unk> said joseph di <unk> chairman of <unk> capital securities a brokerage firm that has an investment in qintex entertainment 
 qintex australia was going to pay more than $ N billion for mgm\/ua and then they could n't come up with the far smaller sum of $ N million 
 qintex said mr. evans the former president resigned for personal reasons and that mr. <unk> an attorney resigned because his participation in evaluating the company 's role in buying mgm\/ua was no longer necessary 
 mr. <unk> was a director of the company and a predecessor firm since N 
 the announcement seemed to further damp prospects that talks between qintex australia and mgm\/ua might be revived 
 it 's understood that mgm\/ua recently contacted rupert murdoch 's news corp. which made two failed bids for the movie studio to see if the company was still interested 
 however we are n't currently doing anything 
 it is n't a current topic of conversation at the company said barry <unk> chairman and chief executive officer of the fox inc. unit of news corp 
 financial printer <unk> & co. said it formed a business translation service which will provide legal financial and other services in most major <unk> including japanese chinese and russian 
 japan 's finance ministry strongly denied playing any role in the new york <unk> free fall 
 <unk> utsumi vice minister for international affairs said the ministry did n't in any way suggest to japanese banks that they stay out of the ual corp. leveraged buy-out 
 the ministry has never even suggested that japanese banks be cautious about leveraged buy-outs in general mr. utsumi said 
 there are no facts behind the <unk> that we sent any kind of signal he declared in an interview 
 the comments were the ministry 's first detailed public statement on the subject and reflect the ministry 's concern that foreigners will think japan is using its tremendous financial power to control events in foreign markets 
 a number of accounts of the events leading to the N point drop in new york stock prices on oct. N accused the ministry of pulling the plug on the ual deal for one reason or another 
 mr. utsumi said the most the ministry had ever done was ask japanese banks about the status of their participation in one previous u.s. leveraged buy-out 
 the ministry <unk> about that deal which mr. utsumi declined to identify because the large presence of japanese banks in the deal was being strongly criticized in the u.s. congress and it was necessary for us to grasp the situation 
 he said the inquiry was n't made in a way that the banks could have interpreted as either encouraging or discouraging participation and he added that none of the japanese banks changed their posture on the deal as a result of the inquiry 
 mr. utsumi also said some japanese banks were willing to participate in the ual financing up to the very end which would suggest at the very least that they were n't under orders to back out 
 in general mr. utsumi said japanese banks are becoming more independent in their approach to overseas deals 
 each japanese bank has its own judgment on the profits and risks in that ual deal he said 
 they are becoming more independent 
 it 's a sound phenomenon 
 <unk> bank ltd. is one japanese bank that decided not to participate in the first ual proposal 
 a <unk> bank spokesman denied that the finance ministry played any part in the bank 's decision 
 we made our own decision he said 
 still mr. utsumi may have a hard time convincing market analysts who have <unk> or <unk> believed that the ministry played a role in <unk> recent moves by japanese banks 
 all week there has been much speculation in financial circles in tokyo and abroad about the ministry 's real position 
 bank analysts say ministry officials have been growing increasingly concerned during the past few months about japanese banks getting in over their heads 
 the ministry thinks the banks do n't know what they are doing that they have very little idea how to cope with risk said one foreign bank analyst who asked not to be identified 
 the ministry wants to see the japanese banks pull in their <unk> on leveraged buy-outs he added 
 although some of the japanese banks involved in the first proposed bid for ual bowed out because they found the terms <unk> observers here say they have a hard time <unk> that commercial considerations were the only reason 
 japanese banks are under political pressure as well the analyst said 
 moreover analysts point out that japanese banks have a reputation for doing deals that are n't extremely profitable if they offer the chance to build market share cement an important business relationship or curry favor with powerful bureaucrats 
 clearly some financial authorities are concerned about the japanese banks role in leveraged buy-outs 
 at a news conference this week bank of japan gov. <unk> <unk> cautioned banks to take a prudent stance regarding highly leveraged deals 
 despite mr. <unk> 's statements it is the finance ministry not the central bank that makes policy decisions 
 while recent events may cool some of the leveraged buy-out fever japanese banks are n't likely to walk away from the game 
 despite the risks the deals can be an attractive way for japanese banks to increase their presence in the u.s. market bank analysts say 
 flush with cash at home but with fewer customers to lend to leading banks are eager to expand overseas 
 jumping in on big deals is a high profile way to <unk> the problem of not having a strong <unk> network 
 france 's national tobacco company known for making <unk> cigarettes such as <unk> and <unk> is <unk> out 
 concerned by <unk> demand for its traditional products it is moving not only into <unk> cigarettes but also into electronic <unk> payment cards to be sold in neighborhood tobacco stores 
 brown tobacco in france is a more <unk> stronger grade than the lighter grade or <unk> tobacco used in so-called <unk> cigarettes 
 we are n't philip morris cos. says <unk> de <unk> chairman of government-owned societe <unk> <unk> <unk> des <unk> & <unk> s.a. known as seita 
 he says that because seita 's profits are limited by <unk> cigarette prices he does n't have the cash to diversify as heavily into food and drink as the u.s. concern has done 
 last year for example seita 's net profit soared N N to N million french francs $ N million on sales of <unk> N billion a N N profit margin 
 instead he said in an interview he is looking for ways to exploit france 's network of N tobacco agents most of them <unk> 
 while seita does n't own the french <unk> its close alliance with them offers distribution possibilities 
 one proposal is to introduce a new payment system for parking in paris 
 instead of paying for parking by putting money in the existing machines which deliver little paper receipts drivers would be able to buy electronic cards in local tobacco shops 
 once <unk> the card would sit in the car 's window showing traffic <unk> how much time the <unk> could remain 
 when the <unk> returned to his car he could turn the card off and if it showed time remaining save it for later 
 seita is a partner in the project which was developed by <unk> <unk> using japanese technology 
 seita and <unk> currently are negotiating with city officials for the right to begin service 
 and seita is considering further diversification 
 it wanted to buy rjr nabisco inc. 's french <unk> subsidiary <unk> in hopes of selling its products in tobacco stores but lost the bidding to food group bsn <unk> 
 it currently is considering bidding for swedish match co 
 and it retains an interest in acquiring <unk> and other articles that might be sold in tobacco shops 
 it also is trying to shore up its tobacco business 
 <unk> cigarettes such as <unk> now make up just N N of the french tobacco market half the level of about two decades ago 
 while seita retains a manufacturing monopoly in france it is being hurt by rising imports and from <unk> cigarette demand 
 so seita has introduced <unk> cigarettes under the <unk> label and intends to <unk> the unsuccessful <unk> <unk> in new packaging similar to the <unk> used by <unk> <unk> 
 the aim says mr. de <unk> is to win market share from imported cigarettes and to persuade smokers who are switching to <unk> cigarettes to keep buying french 
 when the supreme court upheld missouri 's abortion restrictions last july the justices almost certainly did n't have drunk driving <unk> and false <unk> on their minds 
 but the N ruling may have had as much immediate impact on those activities especially <unk> as on abortion rights 
 the decision webster vs. reproductive health services illustrates how supreme court rulings often have a <unk> effect spreading into areas of law and policy that were n't part of the actual cases decided and that never were contemplated by the justices 
 in the missouri case <unk> consequences may have <unk> because the high court <unk> the preamble of the state 's N abortion law 
 the preamble says that human life begins at conception and that <unk> children have rights protected by the constitution 
 last year a federal appeals court in st. louis said the preamble was unconstitutional citing an earlier supreme court ruling that states ca n't justify <unk> abortion curbs by changing the definition of when life begins 
 but the supreme court concluded that it was <unk> to rule on the <unk> of the preamble because the definition of human life had n't yet been used to restrict abortion services 
 the high court majority said it was up to the state courts for now to decide whether the definition has any bearing on other state laws 
 already local missouri judges have relied on the restored preamble in two separate cases to throw out criminal trespass charges against anti-abortion demonstrators who blocked access to reproductive health services an abortion clinic in st. louis 
 the protesters said their actions were justified by the desire to save the lives of <unk> children 
 under a N missouri law persons accused of some crimes including <unk> may offer a defense that their actions were justified as an emergency measure to avoid an imminent public or private injury 
 relying on the preamble 's statement that a <unk> is an <unk> child the two st. louis county circuit court judges in august accepted the <unk> that the abortion clinic protesters were trying to save lives 
 in another case a <unk> ann o'brien was convicted of trespass before the supreme court 's webster ruling 
 last week when her appeal was argued before the missouri court of appeals her lawyer also relied on the preamble 
 the effect of the supreme court webster opinion is that it left room for <unk> to grow in the cracks of roe vs. wade and i think this is one of the cracks said mark <unk> a st. louis lawyer who represented ms. o'brien and the other st. louis protesters 
 roe vs. wade was the supreme court 's N decision that recognized a woman 's right to abortion 
 mario <unk> president of kansas city lawyers for life says that if abortion foes succeed in using the preamble to escape prosecution for trespass this will shut down abortion in missouri 
 there 's no risk to the protesters and you ca n't keep an abortion clinic open if there are N people standing outside every day 
 that would be an ironic result of a case in which the supreme court <unk> stopped short of <unk> roe vs. wade 
 in two other cases the possible consequences of the supreme court ruling appear even more <unk> 
 in one the lawyer for a <unk> resident of columbia mo. who was charged with drunk driving argued that his client should be treated as a <unk> adult because his actual age should be calculated from conception not from birth 
 in missouri those caught drinking and driving between the ages of N and N may have their licenses <unk> for one year while those N or older suffer only a 30-day suspension 
 a boone county judge rejected the motion but daniel <unk> a jefferson city lawyer says he has appealed 
 and in a case filed in federal court in august a lawyer is arguing that missouri authorities are <unk> <unk> the <unk> of a pregnant woman who is in jail for theft and <unk> 
 in terms of sheer <unk> the <unk> regime of <unk> barre may rank as no. N in the world 
 the only reason that somalia remains in <unk> is numbers a <unk> <unk> <unk> of N million people spread out over an <unk> nearly the size of texas 
 the barre <unk> simply is limited in the amount of people it can <unk> and kill 
 <unk> small children <unk> elderly people to death <unk> and shooting women and <unk> people alive are just a few of the <unk> activities that the <unk> armed forces have been engaged in over the past two years 
 up to N <unk> have escaped to the relative safety of marxist ethiopia because of the behavior of president barre 's troops 
 in the port of <unk> for example hundreds of men of the rival <unk> <unk> were <unk> up in may N <unk> and then taken out at night in groups of five to N men to be executed without any judicial process <unk> 
 guns were never used each man was <unk> to death with a large <unk> 
 the <unk> details are only now emerging from a <unk> <unk> report based on hundreds of interviews with <unk> selected refugees 
 the study was done by robert <unk> a consultant to the u.s. state department who has years of experience in investigating human-rights abuses on both sides of the <unk> ideological divide 
 what gives these events particular significance however is the fact that they are part of a wider drama affecting the strategic positions of both the u.s. and the soviet union on the horn of africa 
 not since the late 1970s has the horn been so up for <unk> as it has suddenly become in just the past few weeks 
 mr. barre 's rule is crumbling fast 
 <unk> <unk> his armed forces really just an armed gang which control less than half the country 
 inflation is at record levels 
 desperate he has called in the <unk> to help fight the rebels of the <unk> national movement in the north which is only one of several groups picking away at the regime in the capital of <unk> 
 <unk> years old and a <unk> scientific socialist president barre has a power base composed only of his minority <unk> <unk> that according to observers is narrowing 
 the u.s. 's interest in somalia consists of a single runway at the port of <unk> which u.s. military aircraft have the right to use for <unk> of the gulf of <unk> and the indian ocean 
 that strip of concrete is backed up by a few <unk> <unk> <unk> where a handful of american <unk> <unk> by imported food cold soft drinks and back issues of sports illustrated maintain radio contact with the outside world 
 in the past two years the desert behind them has become a land of mass executions and <unk> <unk> where due to mr. barre 's <unk> and <unk> nobody is any longer in control 
 as long as the rival <unk> regime of mengistu <unk> <unk> held a total gridlock over neighboring ethiopia the u.s. was forced to accept that <unk> <unk> runway as a distant no. N to the soviets ' array of <unk> next door 
 but due to dramatic events on the <unk> over the past few days and weeks those soviet bases may soon be as endangered and as <unk> as the american runway 
 on sept. N i wrote on these pages about the killing and <unk> of N <unk> soldiers by <unk> and <unk> guerrillas 
 recently in <unk> province in the center of ethiopia <unk> forces have killed <unk> and captured an additional N government troops 
 think what these numbers mean considering the headline space devoted to hundreds of deaths in lebanon a small country of little strategic importance 
 <unk> <unk> are now N miles north of <unk> <unk> threatening the town of <unk> which would cut off mr. mengistu 's capital from the port of <unk> through which all fuel and other supplies reach <unk> <unk> 
 as a result mr. mengistu has been forced to transfer thousands of troops from <unk> just to hold the town thereby <unk> the loss of even more territory in <unk> only to keep the <unk> at bay 
 mr. mengistu is in an increasingly weak position half his army is tied down defending the northern city of <unk> from the <unk> 
 the weaker he gets the more he turns toward the u.s. for help 
 while the <unk> are communists like the <unk> they are among the most <unk> guerrillas in the world having suffered more than a decade of <unk> <unk> by the <unk> mengistu air force 
 what this all means in <unk> is that soviet dominance in ethiopia is <unk> as fast as president barre 's regime in somalia is 
 the u.s. therefore has a historic opportunity both to strike a blow for human rights in somalia and to undo the <unk> <unk> of the late 1970s on the horn of africa 
 back to somalia 
 the state department to its credit has already begun <unk> itself from mr. barre <unk> by its decision to publish the <unk> report which the press has ignored 
 what 's more the u.s. has suspended $ N million in military aid and $ N million in economic aid 
 but this is not enough 
 because the u.s. is still perceived to be tied to mr. barre when he goes the runway could go too 
 considering how <unk> the security of that runway is anyway the better option both morally and <unk> would be for the bush administration to blast the regime publicly in terms clear enough for all influential <unk> to understand 
 it is a <unk> that mr. barre 's days are numbered 
 the u.s. should take care however that its own position in the country does not go down with him 
 nobody is sure what will come next in somalia or whom the successor might be 
 but as one expert tells me whoever it is will have to work pretty damn hard to be worse than barre 
 while the state department positions itself for the <unk> period in somalia it should continue to back former president carter 's <unk> role as a mediator between mr. mengistu and the <unk> guerrillas in ethiopia while <unk> opening up channels of communications with the <unk> rebels through neighboring <unk> 
 <unk> politics are the most sophisticated <unk> and <unk> in all of black africa 
 remember that it took mr. mengistu many months in what became known as the creeping coup to topple <unk> <unk> <unk> in N and N 
 there is simply no way to engineer a succession <unk> as is sometimes possible elsewhere on the continent

 opec 's ability to produce more petroleum than it can sell is beginning to cast a shadow over world oil markets 
 output from the organization of petroleum exporting countries is already at a high for the year and most member nations are running flat out 
 but industry and opec officials agree that a handful of members still have enough unused capacity to <unk> the market and cause an <unk> collapse a few months from now if opec does n't soon adopt a new quota system to <unk> its <unk> <unk> 
 as a result the effort by some oil ministers to get opec to approve a new permanent <unk> agreement next month is taking on increasing urgency 
 the organization is scheduled to meet in vienna beginning nov. N 
 so far this year rising demand for opec oil and production restraint by some members have kept prices firm despite rampant cheating by others 
 but that could change if demand for opec 's oil <unk> seasonally early next year as some think may happen 
 opec is currently producing more than N million barrels a day sharply above its nominal <unk> fourth-quarter ceiling of N million according to opec and industry officials at an oil conference here sponsored by the oil daily and the international herald tribune 
 at that rate a majority of opec 's N members have reached their output limits they said 
 but it is estimated that at least three million barrels a day and possibly as much as seven million barrels a day of spare capacity still exists within opec 
 most is concentrated in five persian gulf countries including his own <unk> <unk> <unk> 's oil minister told the conference friday 
 he puts opec 's current capacity at N million to N million barrels a day 
 that 's higher than some other estimates 
 <unk> <unk> <unk> kuwait 's oil minister recently estimated opec capacity at N million barrels a day 
 either way the <unk> is big enough to keep <unk> balanced oil markets on edge 
 even modest amounts of additional output by those with the huge extra capacity and reserves such as saudi arabia and <unk> could upset the market 
 the <unk> oil minister and saudi oil minister <unk> <unk> insisted in their comments to the conference that their countries would act <unk> to maintain a stable market 
 however in interviews later both ministers stressed that they expect future opec quotas to be based mainly on the production capacity and reserves of each member 
 under that approach countries with the most unused oil capacity would get bigger shares of any future increases in opec 's production ceiling than they would under the current system 
 if you are already producing at N N or N N of your capacity what 's the good to be told you can produce at N N of capacity asked mr. <unk> 
 at an <unk> geneva meeting late last month opec 's oil ministers <unk> approved another increase of one million barrels a day in their production ceiling 
 they <unk> it out using the existing formula however which meant that even those countries that could n't produce more received higher official <unk> 
 the main effect of the ceiling boost was to <unk> some of the <unk> already coming from the quota <unk> 
 still there was a <unk> at geneva 
 previously no opec member had been willing to accept a reduction in its percentage share of the group 's total output target or ceiling 
 but the concept of disproportionate quotas for those with unused capacity advanced there in an iranian proposal was generally endorsed by the ministers 
 in the end politics got in the way 
 libya accepted iran 's proposal only so long as it was promised production parity with kuwait 
 and the united arab <unk> a <unk> quota <unk> refused to give any guarantee it would change its ways 
 but the oil ministers continue to study the plan and it will probably be the basis for discussion at next month 's meeting 
 it 's understood several <unk> already have been worked into the plan 
 the ceiling would be lifted to N million barrels to provide kuwait and the united arab <unk> much higher official quotas while reducing percentage shares of some others 
 libya 's previous conditions are no longer considered a problem although the united arab <unk> is still an issue 
 saudi arabia opec 's <unk> also has surfaced as a possible obstacle some opec sources said 
 insisting on a N N share of any ceiling saudi officials have long pressed for the pro <unk> distribution of increases to all members 
 in geneva however they supported iran 's proposal because it would have left the saudi percentage of the opec total intact and increased actual saudi volume to nearly N million barrels daily from five million 
 some of the proposed modifications since however call on saudi arabia to give back to the <unk> pool a <unk> N barrels 
 though tiny that 's a reduction in its share 
 mr. <unk> the saudi oil minister reiterated here that the kingdom would insist on maintaining its percentage share of opec production under any quota revisions 
 under any circumstances saudi arabia should get more rather than less mr. <unk> said 
 in a blow to france 's rafale jet fighter the french navy for the first time publicly stated its desire to buy N mcdonnell douglas corp. <unk> <unk> to defend its aircraft carriers 
 the statement is likely to <unk> the debate within france 's military establishment over the rafale which is made by <unk> <unk> <unk> aviation <unk> 
 in an interview in the navy 's official weekly magazine <unk> <unk> the navy 's <unk> adm. <unk> goupil said the navy still intends to buy N <unk> as scheduled in the late 1990s and early <unk> century 
 the air force is to take at least N more 
 adm. goupil said the navy ca n't wait until N when the naval rafale becomes available to replace its <unk> fleet of <unk> crusaders used since the 1950s to protect carriers from attack 
 rather than <unk> the crusaders which dassault is proposing to do for around N billion french francs $ N million adm. goupil said the navy wants to buy used <unk> from the u.s. navy 
 officially the statement is n't an attack on the rafale 
 adm. goupil said that when the <unk> wear out the navy is prepared to take <unk> to replace them 
 but <unk> senior navy officials sharply <unk> the rafale as an air force plane <unk> to carrier use 
 although they never said so publicly they have made no secret of their preference for the <unk> on operational grounds 
 adm. goupil 's comments are likely to <unk> the broader dispute within the military establishment here over the role of dassault 
 although <unk> dassault still is run by the founder 's son chairman <unk> dassault who has fiercely protected his company 's independence 
 the rafale project is the result of france 's inability jointly to develop a plane with other countries and french officials question whether the state can continue paying for expensive independent programs 
 so far mr. dassault has resisted pressure to change 
 what brought the naval issue to a head is that the crusaders are literally falling apart without any immediate plan to replace them 
 adm. goupil a former <unk> <unk> leader said that the last other country to use crusaders the philippines retired its last ones two years ago 
 a french <unk> crash a few months ago heightened pressure for new planes here 
 adm. goupil rejected dassault 's proposal to <unk> the crusaders saying the cost was impossible to estimate 
 even <unk> he said the crusaders represent an <unk> and dangerous protection for the aircraft carriers france has sent to meet such crises as the wars in lebanon and the persian gulf

 for cathay pacific airways the smooth ride may be ending 
 the first signs of trouble came last month when the hong kong carrier a subsidiary of <unk> pacific ltd. posted a N N drop in operating profit for the first six months and warned that margins will remain under pressure for the rest of the year 
 securities analysts many of whom scrapped their buy recommendations after seeing cathay 's interim figures believe more <unk> lie ahead 
 fuel and personnel costs are rising and tourism in and through hong kong remains <unk> by china 's turmoil since the june N killings in beijing 
 in addition delivery delays for the first two of as many as N boeing <unk> that the carrier has ordered have raised costs because personnel had been hired to man the planes 
 and tough competition in the air-freight market is cutting into an important sideline 
 there also is concern that once hong kong <unk> to china 's sovereignty in N cathay will be forced to play second <unk> to china 's <unk> flag carrier civil aviation administration of china or <unk> 
 the sense is we would never be in a position again where everything works for us the way it did before says rod eddington cathay 's commercial director 
 <unk> hall an analyst at james capel far east ltd. says there is n't much cathay can do about rising costs for jet fuel hong kong 's tight labor market or the strengthening of the local currency which is pegged to the u.s. dollar 
 these factors are further complicated by the airline 's push to transform itself from a regional carrier to an international one ms. hall says 
 ms. hall expects cathay 's profit to grow around N N annually this year and next 
 in N it earned $ N billion hong kong us$ N million on revenue of hk$ N billion 
 cathay is taking several steps to bolster business 
 one step is to beef up its fleet 
 in addition to aircraft from boeing co. cathay announced earlier this year an order for as many as N airbus <unk> 
 the expansion which could cost as much as us$ N billion over the next eight years will expand the fleet to about N planes by N up from N at the end of last year according to sun hung <unk> securities ltd 
 the <unk> airbus planes will be used largely to replace cathay 's aging fleet of lockheed <unk> for regional flights while the boeing aircraft will be used on <unk> routes to europe and north america 
 cathay also is moving some of its <unk> <unk> operations outside hong kong 
 fierce bidding for young employees in hong kong is pushing up cathay 's labor costs by N N a year for <unk> staff while experienced skilled employees are leaving the colony as part of the brain drain 
 some jobs already have been moved to australia and there are plans to place others in canada 
 david bell a spokesman for the airline says the move is partly aimed at retaining existing staff who are leaving to secure foreign <unk> ahead of N 
 cathay is working to promote hong kong as a <unk> worth visiting on its own merits rather than just a <unk> 
 although the june N killings in beijing have hurt its china flights cathay 's other routes have retained high load factors 
 mr. eddington <unk> promoting hong kong as an important part of attracting visitors from japan south korea and taiwan where the number of people looking to travel abroad has surged 
 there also has been speculation that cathay will be among the major private-sector participants in the hong kong government 's plans to build a new airport with the carrier possibly investing in its own terminal 
 cathay officials decline to comment on the speculation 
 mr. eddington sees alliances with other carriers particularly cathay 's recent link with amr corp. 's american airlines as an important part of cathay 's strategy 
 but he <unk> that cathay has n't any interest in <unk> equity stakes with the u.s. carrier or with lufthansa the west german airline with which it has <unk> for about a decade 
 analysts believe cathay is approached for such swaps by other carriers on a regular basis particularly as the popularity of share exchanges has grown among european carriers 
 we think alliances are very important mr. eddington says 
 but we 'd rather put funds into our own business rather than someone else 's 
 i 'm not sure <unk> would necessarily make things <unk> 
 in a pattern it aims to copy in several key u.s. <unk> cathay recently announced plans to serve san francisco by flying into american airlines ' los angeles hub and <unk> continuing passengers onto a flight on the u.s. carrier 
 we 'll never have a big operation in the u.s. and they 'll never have one as big as us in the pacific mr. eddington says 
 but this way american will coordinate good <unk> to boston new york chicago and dallas 
 we 'll coordinate on this end to places like <unk> singapore and manila 
 asian traffic which currently accounts for N N of cathay 's business is expected to continue as the carrier 's mainstay 
 cathay has long stated its desire to double its weekly flights into china to N and it is applying to <unk> <unk> flights into vietnam 
 further expansion into southern europe is also possible says mr. bell the spokesman 
 while a large number of hong kong companies have <unk> offshore ahead of N such a move is n't an option for cathay because it would jeopardize its landing rights in hong kong 
 and mr. eddington <unk> rules out a move to london our <unk> is hong kong traffic rights 
 he says the airline is putting its faith in the <unk> agreement on hong kong 's return to china 
 a special section dealing with aviation rights states that landing rights for hong kong 's airlines which include the smaller hong kong <unk> airlines will continue to be negotiated by hong kong 's government 
 but critics <unk> that <unk> officials ultimately will be responsible to beijing 
 my feeling is cathay does n't have a hope in the long run says an analyst who declines to be identified 
 cathay would love to keep going but the general sense is they 're going to have to do something 
 mr. eddington acknowledges that the carrier will have to <unk> and <unk> to local changes but he feels that the <unk> agreement is firm ground to build on for the foreseeable future 
 we 're confident that it protects our route structure he says and our ability to grow and <unk>

 the san francisco society for the prevention of <unk> to animals also has been providing medical care food water and foster homes for <unk> animals

 the neighborhood around alexander <unk> co. 's vermont-slauson shopping center in the watts section of los angeles resembles the <unk> deteriorating sections of many inner cities and certainly is n't the sort of area one would choose to visit 
 but turn into the shopping center 's parking lot and one could be in the safe busy mall of a <unk> suburb 
 only it is safer and <unk> 
 over the past year there have been only one <unk> three <unk> of or from autos no <unk> and one attempted <unk> in the mall which opened in late N 
 a shopping center of similar size in an affluent los angeles suburb would per year be expected to have eight <unk> N <unk> of or from autos and four <unk> 
 the watts mall has annual sales of more than $ N per <unk> square foot the figure for a comparable suburban shopping center would be $ N 
 three other <unk> shopping centers in the watts area are doing almost as well 
 a successful <unk> mall in a <unk> area violates the more typical inner-city pattern in which commercial areas are taken over by <unk> youth gangs and the criminal element with an erosion of the customer base development capital and <unk> 
 major regional and national chain stores are replaced by <unk> operations offering <unk> merchandise at higher prices 
 along with the exodus of shopping opportunities is an exodus of the jobs that the major chains used to provide to community residents 
 thus there is even more to the vermont-slauson center than a good place to shop 
 this <unk> commercial zone becomes for the residents a secure <unk> in a <unk> urban landscape evidence that community <unk> is not inevitable and that the gangs are not <unk> 
 the center improves the community image to outsiders as well and may help to arrest or even reverse the exodus of capital and investment 
 an additional benefit is the creation of jobs 
 this starts in the construction phase through the use of minority contractors and local workers 
 it continues through the life of the center the vermont-slauson center has created N permanent private-sector jobs at a one-time cost in public funds of only $ N per job 
 as many of these jobs are filled by local residents who move from the welfare rolls to the tax rolls the $ <unk> public investment should repay itself in a few years 
 and that is before consideration of increased state and local revenues from taxes and fees on sales real estate licenses and the like 
 profits are also <unk> back into the community the <unk> vermont-slauson economic development corp. receives N N of the profits from the vermont-slauson center and uses the money to provide moderate and low-cost housing in the community now running into the hundreds of units as well as commercial and industrial development projects 
 bradford <unk> director of the mayor 's city economic development office says there is no question that vermont-slauson had a <unk> effect on the surrounding neighborhood 
 what had been a deteriorated area with nothing but <unk> shops and <unk> shops is now experiencing a major upgrading in the housing and commercial stock thanks to a <unk> <unk> source of <unk> capital that vermont-slauson yields 
 another benefit is that substantial <unk> of the <unk> in these centers are minority businessmen and women 
 in the grand <unk> plaza developed by <unk> realty group in chicago 's third ward opposite the robert taylor homes N N of the stores to date have been leased to blacks and N N to members of other minority groups 
 children from the community will have <unk> role models than the drug <unk> 
 so what 's the catch 
 primarily that putting one of these inner-city deals together takes time patience <unk> of vision and negotiating skills that not all developers <unk> 
 security costs are also quite high 
 one of these centers can involve years of negotiating with numerous public agencies local political leaders and citizen groups and with prospective tenants and sources of financing 
 suburban deals are not without their delays and <unk> inner-city deals just have more of them 
 security at a typical <unk> inner-city center is impressive but <unk> 
 the entire site is <unk> by a <unk> <unk> iron <unk> with a small number of <unk> gates 
 <unk> and flowers give it a <unk> and <unk> appearance 
 <unk> motion detectors and <unk> tv cameras monitor the entire center lighting levels are three to five times the industry standard 
 the security command post <unk> as <unk> retail space has its own <unk> 's <unk> above the <unk> of the other buildings with a <unk> view of the entire center 
 local law enforcement is present in a <unk> <unk> space donated by the center 
 these features are also used in <unk> realty group 's grand <unk> plaza 
 <unk> has its own large security force of <unk> and <unk> personnel on <unk> duty at each center 
 security is N N to N N of the common area charges of these centers vs. an industry average of about N N 
 these security costs are kept <unk> because the centers ' site acquisition construction and financing costs were reduced by such programs as urban development action grants economic development administration grants community development block grants tax-free industrial development bonds enterprise zone tax write-offs city infrastructure grants and tax <unk> financing 
 many of these programs no longer exist or have been severely cut back 
 however since these centers appear to pay for themselves there is nothing to prevent state and local governments from <unk> legislation with similar provisions 
 many states already have enterprise zones and legislation that combines tax incentives loans and grants to encourage investment in depressed areas with requirements for the hiring of the <unk> and minorities 
 these programs could be expanded to focus on funds for project planning identifying sources of funds and for acquiring a site and preparing it 
 <unk> crime and the fear of it in inner-city commercial areas should give enterprise zones more success than most have enjoyed to date 
 with many suburban areas basically overbuilt with shopping centers inner-city areas may represent a major new <unk> market for investment 
 new approaches to mall design and operation make it possible to tap these markets 
 if the risks and rewards are reasonable developers will respond 
 government officials who wonder how important it is for them to encourage development in high-risk areas should visit vermont-slauson and grand <unk> plaza and decide for themselves

 for bankers and regulators arizona is looking more like texas every day 
 on friday los angeles-based first interstate bancorp said it expects a net loss of $ N million for the third quarter of N because of hemorrhaging at its first interstate bank of arizona unit 
 first interstate said the unit <unk> by arizona 's worsening real-estate woes will have a $ N million loss for the quarter 
 first interstate took a huge $ N million provision for loan losses at the arizona bank 
 it charged off an estimated $ N million of arizona loans leaving the unit with a reserve for future losses of $ N million about N N of its $ N million of troubled loans and <unk> real estate 
 first interstate made the move under pressure from regulators 
 the action capped a <unk> of grim arizona banking news for the third quarter and <unk> signaled that arizona is challenging texas 's long <unk> as banking 's busiest <unk> 
 earlier last week valley national corp. the state 's largest locally owned banking company reported a $ N million loss and suspended its dividend 
 pinnacle west capital corp. which has been <unk> with regulators for months over what to do about pinnacle 's <unk> merabank thrift unit suspended its dividend and reported a N N plunge in third-quarter net income 
 security pacific corp. said third-quarter credit losses surged a third to $ N million mainly because of sour arizona real-estate loans 
 new york-based chase manhattan corp. took an $ N million <unk> charge 
 furthermore the regulatory <unk> behind first interstate 's loss suggests regulators have concluded that lenders ' reserves are far too low to absorb their future arizona losses and are forcing bankers to do something about it 
 <unk> from the office of the comptroller of the currency had been <unk> through first interstate 's real-estate portfolio since last month they first recommended that first interstate take a provision that was less than the eventual $ N million third-quarter hit 
 when first interstate balked arguing that the figure was too high regulators responded by raising their recommendation to $ N million 
 at that point first interstate decided it was the better part of <unk> not to negotiate further said one industry official close to the talks 
 thomas p. <unk> chief financial officer would n't comment about the details of the negotiations 
 he said the provision was n't forced upon us but the regulators made it very clear what they thought was an appropriate number 
 the tough regulatory stance <unk> large future losses especially at the state 's thrifts 
 at least six of arizona 's N savings and loan institutions have either been taken over by the government 's conservatorship program or are essentially insolvent they are sitting on enormous <unk> losses 
 for example western savings & loan association which is now in conservatorship had tangible <unk> minus liabilities of a negative $ N million at june N 
 it had a $ N million loss in the second quarter 
 yet it still held $ N million of <unk> real estate for which it maintains no reserves <unk> 
 it also had $ N million of <unk> loans its level of reserves against those was n't immediately available though it is believed to be small 
 the rapid deterioration of the arizona thrifts only adds to the <unk> cost of the government 's massive thrift bailout officially estimated at about $ N billion 
 together the six <unk> or essentially insolvent arizona thrifts have tangible capital of a negative $ N billion foreclosed property of $ N billion and <unk> loans of $ N billion 
 they have no reserves against the real estate and their reserves against the loans are <unk> compared with the levels of reserves banks are moving to set up 
 the thrifts had a combined loss of $ N million in the second quarter 
 other lenders have been recovering only N cents to N cents on the dollar on foreclosed arizona property if they can sell it at all 
 all this havoc is the result of one of the worst <unk> in arizona 's <unk> history compounded by some of the usual suspects in 1980s banking <unk> greed fraud and plain bad banking 
 in the late 1970s and early 1980s lenders and developers poured money into office buildings <unk> and massive <unk> of raw desert land confident that arizona 's population would grow at annual rates of N N to N N for years to come 
 now annual population growth is running at about N N a year some desert <unk> bought three years ago for $ N an <unk> are being sold at $ N an <unk> and phoenix has a seven-year supply of <unk> office space 
 it 's horrible to say but it 's unfortunate that earthquake was n't in phoenix it might have knocked out some of our empty buildings said <unk> jackson a prominent arizona businessman with interests in real estate banking and many other businesses 
 many arizona real-estate experts think the worst may be yet to come 
 ralph <unk> publisher of <unk> update newsletter said <unk> have climbed to about N a month just in <unk> county where phoenix is located 
 that 's up from about N a month in N and it 's accelerating so far this month <unk> are averaging about N a day 
 it 's <unk> mr. <unk> said 
 moreover mr. <unk> and others said residential real estate which had remained fairly strong through most of the downturn is beginning to <unk> more and more of the <unk> 
 and the generally <unk> condition of arizona 's lenders means there is little capital available in the state to shore up the economy and slow down the slide 
 it 's reasonable to say there is not a <unk> s&l in the state and the amount of viable bank capital is very low said mr. jackson 
 we 're going to see another big wave of failures and defaults between now and year-end 
 the only thing a lot of these lenders can get out of their mouth now is pay me in N days 
 first interstate had a $ N million loss in N 's third quarter mainly from <unk> and reserves connected with its texas operations 
 for the six months ended june N it reported net income of $ N million or $ N a share including $ N million from tax credits and accounting changes 
 the bank 's arizona unit holds about $ N billion of first interstate 's $ N billion of assets 
 mr. <unk> said the bank expects arizona real-estate prices which plummeted N N over the last year to fall another N N before stabilizing 
 some in arizona think that may be optimistic 
 first interstate said its operations outside of arizona achieved results as expected for the quarter but did n't specify the results 
 first interstate stock closed at $ N down N cents in composite trading friday on the new york stock exchange 
 since its unsuccessful bid for bankamerica corp. in N the bank has undertaken a major restructuring in an effort to cut costs and boost performance but many industry officials believe it may be <unk> for a takeover bid especially with interstate banking set to begin in california in N 
 mr. <unk> said the problems in arizona have only increased our resolve to continue to make our restructuring even more effective 
 separately standard & poor 's corp. lowered its ratings on valley national corp. 's senior debt to <unk> from <unk> affecting about $ N million of long-term debt 
 s&p also lowered ratings on unsecured deposits and issues backed by a letter of credit from the bank holding company 's principal unit valley national bank of arizona 
 the ratings service said the <unk> reflect the continued slide in the company 's financial condition 
 a spokesman for phoenix <unk> valley national said the concern will be able to withstand the current downturn in arizona real estate 
 commercial paper holders have reinvested their funds he said and consumer deposits have been up in the last few days 
 <unk> corp. said its scientists isolated a <unk> which may hold potential as a treatment for disruptions of the <unk> ranging from <unk> rejection to <unk> and <unk> 
 the <unk> is the mouse version of a protein called the <unk> <unk> 
 <unk> is a <unk> which directs the growth and function of white blood cells involved in the body 's immune response 
 the <unk> <unk> on the surface of such cells receives the <unk> 's message to rally the body 's defense 
 but in certain conditions such as <unk> diseases and <unk> and transplant rejection doctors would like to damp the immune response so such cells do n't touch off harmful <unk> reactions or cell destruction 
 a <unk> form of the <unk> might turn off a specific part of the immune response without general immune <unk> the company said 
 the <unk> <unk> is one of five such <unk> to be developed and tested by <unk> corp. a spinoff of <unk> through a proposed $ N million initial public offering 
 <unk> will contract with the spinoff to provide the research development and initial testing of the new agents

 conner peripherals inc. which has a <unk> on a key part used in many portable computers is on target to <unk> compaq computer corp. as the fastest-growing start-up manufacturing firm in u.s. business history 
 conner dominates the market for hard-disk drives used to store data in laptop computers 
 it said yesterday that net income for its third quarter soared N N to $ N million or N cents a share from $ N million or N cents a share in the year-ago period 
 its revenue totaled $ N million an increase of N N from $ N million a year ago 
 for the nine months the san jose calif.-based company said net income jumped N N to $ N million or N cents a share from $ N million or N cents a share 
 revenue nearly tripled to $ N million from $ N million 
 analysts expect conner 's earnings to reach roughly $ N million or $ N to $ N a share on sales of $ N million for N the company 's third full year in business 
 that 's a faster growth rate than reported by compaq which did n't post similar results until its fourth year in N 
 but compaq had achieved that level of sales faster than any previous manufacturing start-up 
 conner 's performance is closely tied to the <unk> demand for <unk> computers the computer industry 's fastest-growing segment 
 since its inception conner has both benefited from and helped make possible the rapid spread of portable computers by selling storage devices that consume five to N times less electricity than drives used in desktop machines 
 today conner controls an estimated N N of the hard-disk drive market for laptop computers 
 the company supplies drives to compaq and zenith data systems the top two u.s. manufacturers of <unk> and to toshiba corp. nec corp. and sharp corp. the leading japanese laptop makers 
 they 've had this field to themselves for over a year now and they 've been greatly <unk> said bob <unk> an analyst at <unk> inc. a market researcher in los <unk> calif 
 in the coming months however this is likely to change 
 next month seagate technology which is the dominant supplier of hard-disk drives for personal computers plans to introduce its first family of <unk> drives for <unk> computers 
 and the japanese are likely to keep close on conner 's heels 
 they are going to catch up said david <unk> an analyst with hambrecht & quist 
 both toshiba and nec already produce hard-disk drives and sony also is studying the field mr. <unk> said 
 but conner is n't standing still 
 yesterday the company introduced four products three of which are aimed at a hot new class of computers called <unk> 
 each of the three drives uses a mere N watts of power and one <unk> just N ounces 
 most of our competitors are announcing products based on our older products said <unk> conner chief executive officer and founder of the firm that bears his name 
 we continue to develop products faster than anyone else can 
 these new products could account for as much as N N of the company 's business in N mr. conner estimated 
 we 're not afraid of <unk> some of our old stuff to stay ahead of the competition he said 
 conner already is shipping its new drives 
 last week for instance compaq introduced its first notebook computer to <unk> reviews 
 conner is supplying hard-disk drives for the machine which <unk> only six pounds and fits in a <unk> 
 from its inception conner has targeted the market for <unk> machines building hard-disk drives that are smaller and use far less power than those offered by competitors such as seagate 
 the availability of these drives in turn boosted demand for laptop computers whose <unk> had been limited because of lack of storage 
 conner also makes hard-disk drives for desktop computers and is a major supplier to compaq which as of july owned N N of conner 's stock 
 sales to compaq represented N N of conner 's business in its third quarter compared with N N in the year-ago period

 there is no charge for research only for time on the phone 
 if the matter requires further legal work or litigation mr. cane says his lawyers may refer the client to a law firm

 indeed in a note to the results directors said if the true worth of some of the group 's assets were taken into account instead of using book values the negative net asset backing a share would turn into a substantial positive one 
 the <unk> supermarket went out of business last may 
 the reason was not high interest rates or labor costs 
 nor was there a shortage of customers in the area the residential <unk> section of northern manhattan 
 the business closed when the owner was murdered by <unk> 
 the owner was israel ortiz a <unk> entrepreneur and father of two 
 in his first year of operating the store he bought for $ N mr. ortiz was robbed at least twice at <unk> 
 the first time he was shot in the hand as he <unk> the <unk> outside 
 the second time he identified two <unk> who were arrested and charged 
 two weeks later perhaps in <unk> mr. ortiz was shot three times in the back during what police classified as a third <unk> attempt 
 that was his reward for working until N p.m. seven days a week to cover his $ N a month rent 
 for providing what his customers described as very personal and helpful service 
 for creating a focus for neighborhood life 
 israel ortiz is only one of the thousands of entrepreneurs and their employees who will be injured or killed by crime this year 
 the u.s. bureau of justice statistics reports that almost N N of all <unk> workers suffer injuries from crime each year almost twice the national average and about four times the rate for teachers truck drivers medical workers and <unk> salespeople 
 only a few other <unk> have higher reported rates of criminal injury such as police <unk> and taxi drivers 
 yet these figures show only the most visible part of the problem 
 recent data from new york city provide more of the picture 
 while by no means the highest crime community in the country new york is a prime example of a city where crime <unk> small-business development 
 a survey of small businesses there was conducted this spring by <unk> a policy research organization 
 it gave N businesses a <unk> and <unk> N responses 
 the survey found that over a three-year period N N of the firms said employees or owners had been robbed on their way to or from work or while on the job 
 <unk> percent reported their customers being robbed 
 crime was the reason that N N reported difficulty recruiting personnel and that N N said they were considering moving 
 more than one-third of the responding businesses said they suffer from drug dealing and <unk> near their premises 
 in brooklyn and the bronx one out of four commercial firms is <unk> each year 
 industrial neighborhoods fare even worse with <unk> rates twice the <unk> average 
 crime is clearly more deadly to <unk> <unk> than to big businesses 
 two decades ago the small business administration reported yale prof. albert <unk> 's landmark study of crime against N small businesses drawn from national irs records 
 he found that monetary crime losses as a proportion of gross receipts were N times higher for small businesses than for large ones 
 the new york study 's companies averaged N employees their annual crime losses averaged about $ N with an additional $ N annual cost in security enough money to hire at least one more worker 
 the costs of crime may also be enough to destroy a struggling business 
 whatever the monetary crime losses they may not be nearly as important to entrepreneurs as the risk of personal injury 
 after repeated gun <unk> some entrepreneurs may give up a business out of fear for their lives 
 one washington couple recently sold their liquor store after N years in business that included four <unk> deaths and N <unk> or <unk> on the premises 
 these findings illustrate the vicious cycle that national institute of justice director james k. stewart calls crime causing poverty 
 <unk> neighborhoods offer relatively few employment opportunities contributing to the poverty of local residents 
 small neighborhood businesses could provide more jobs if crime were not so harmful to creating and maintaining those businesses 
 this may help explain why small businesses create N N of all jobs nationally but only N N of jobs in a <unk> city like new york 
 bigger business can often better afford to minimize the cost of crime 
 the new york study found that the cost of security measures in firms with fewer than five employees was almost $ N per worker compared with one-third that amount for firms with more than N employees 
 the shift of retailing to large shopping centers has created even greater economies of scale for providing <unk> business environments 
 private security guards and <unk> police can <unk> the law of trespass to regulate access to these <unk> places 
 since N in fact revenues of the N largest guard companies primarily serving such big businesses have increased by almost N N 
 few small neighborhood businesses however can afford such protection even in collaboration with other local merchants 
 in the neighborhoods with the highest crime rates small business generally relies on the public police force for protection 
 this creates several problems 
 one is that there are not enough police to satisfy small businesses 
 the number one proposal for reducing crime in the new york survey was to put more police on foot or <unk> <unk> suggested by more than two-thirds of the respondents 
 only N N supported private security <unk> funded by the merchants themselves 
 a second problem is the persistent frustration of false <unk> which can make urban police less than enthusiastic about responding to calls from small businesses 
 only half the new york small businesses surveyed for their part are satisfied with the police response they receive 
 some cities including new york have <unk> with special tax districts for commercial areas that provide additional <unk> funded by local businesses 
 but this raises added cost barriers to urban <unk> 
 another solution cities might consider is giving special priority to police <unk> of small-business areas 
 for cities losing business to suburban shopping centers it may be a <unk> business investment to help keep those jobs and sales taxes within city limits 
 increased <unk> of business zones makes sense because urban crime is heavily concentrated in such hot spots of <unk> <unk> 
 with national institute of justice support the minneapolis police and the crime control institute are currently testing the effects of such a strategy <unk> its <unk> value with traditional random <unk> 
 small-business <unk> would be an especially helpful <unk> whenever a small-business person is scheduled to testify against a <unk> suspect 
 while no guarantee an increased police presence might even deter further attacks 
 it might even have saved the life and business of israel ortiz

 diversification pays 
 that 's a fundamental lesson for investors but its truth was demonstrated once again in the performance of mutual funds during and after the stock market 's friday-the-13th plunge 
 stock funds like the market as a whole generally dropped more than N N in the week through last thursday according to figures compiled by lipper analytical services inc 
 that reflects the huge drop a week ago friday last monday 's rebound and the <unk> and <unk> that followed 
 but several other types of funds <unk> investors from the worst of the market 's slide 
 funds that invest internationally were the <unk> stock and fixed-income funds 
 more than ever people should realize they should have a diversified portfolio said <unk> <unk> a senior vice president of vanguard group 
 that means stocks bonds money market instruments and real estate 
 one week 's performance should n't be the basis for any investment decision 
 but the latest mutual fund performance figures do show what can happen when the going gets rough 
 you want to know how a fund did when the market got <unk> said kurt brouwer an investment adviser with brouwer & <unk> in san francisco 
 it 's like <unk> the tires of a car 
 what you want to know is when the road 's rough when there 's snow and ice how 's this car going to perform 
 general equity funds fell an average of N N in the week ended thursday compared with a N N slide for the standard & poor 's 500-stock index 
 but lipper analytical 's figures show that there were a number of ways investors could have <unk> themselves from the stock market 's gyrations 
 <unk> funds for instance which invest in companies that mine and process the precious metal posted an average decline of N N 
 flexible portfolio funds which <unk> investments among stocks bonds and money-market instruments and other investments declined at about half the rate of stock funds an average drop of N N according to lipper 
 global allocation funds take the <unk> concept one step further by investing at least N N of their portfolios outside the u.s. 
 this gives them the added benefits of international diversification including a foreign-exchange boost during periods like the past week when the dollar declines against other major currencies 
 with all that going for them global flexible portfolio funds declined only N N in the week through last thursday 
 but while the merits of diversification <unk> through when times are tough there 's also a price to pay a diversified portfolio always <unk> an <unk> portfolio during those times when the investment in the <unk> portfolio is truly hot 
 and friday the 13th notwithstanding stocks have been this year 's hot investment 
 thus even including the latest week the average general stock fund has soared more than N N so far this year the lipper analytical figures show 
 by comparison global asset allocation funds have turned in an average total return of about N N while domestic flexible portfolios are up about N N 
 fixed-income funds have returned N N while gold funds which tend to be volatile have risen just N N on average 
 that 's the problem with trying to hedge too much said mr. brouwer 
 you do n't make any real money 
 over the last N years for example mr. brouwer says an investor putting $ N a year in the s&p N would have made nearly twice as much than if it were invested in treasury bills 
 some equity funds did better than others in the week that began on friday the 13th 
 the $ N million <unk> fund for instance was the seventh top performing fund for the week with a N N return 
 its return so far this year has been a credible N N 
 the fund 's strategy is to sell when a stock <unk> N N over its cost 
 by the time the market plummeted N days ago <unk> was N N in cash said robert <unk> president and portfolio manager 
 last monday he started buying the high-quality growth companies that people were throwing away at discount prices 
 among mr. <unk> 's picks <unk> systems reebok international ltd. and digital microwave corp 
 the fund 's cash position is now about N N which mr. <unk> calls still bearish 
 among the big stock funds dreyfus fund with more than $ N billion in assets had a decline of just N N for the week and a return of N N for the year 
 howard stein chairman of dreyfus corp. said the fund was about half invested in government bonds on oct. N and about N N in cash 
 in a downward market bonds act better he said 
 we still think there 's a lot of <unk> in this market 
 we believe interest rates will continue to trend lower and the economy will slow around the world 
 many of the funds that did best in the last week are heavily invested overseas giving them the benefit of foreign currency <unk> when the dollar is weak 
 from its high point on thursday oct. N to where it traded late in new york a week later the dollar fell N N against the west german mark N N against the british pound and N N against the japanese yen 
 three international cash portfolios funds which invest almost exclusively in bonds and money-market instruments overseas were among the four <unk> funds in the latest week 
 because the funds ' investments are <unk> in foreign currencies their value expressed in dollars goes up when those currencies rise against the dollar 
 but when the dollar rises against major foreign currencies as it did for much of this year the dollar value of these funds declines 
 all three funds posted negative returns for the year to date 
 of the funds that fared the worst in the <unk> N week two are heavily invested in airlines stocks which led the market slide following problems with financing for the ual corp buy-out plan 
 reflecting airline takeover activity however both the fidelity select air transportation portfolio and the national aviation & technology fund posted <unk> returns for the the year to date N N for the fidelity air transportation fund and a <unk> N N for national aviation & technology 
 the small drop in equity funds in general in the latest week may not necessarily be a good sign said a. michael lipper president of lipper analytical 
 noting that equity funds are up nearly N N from their post-crash low on dec. N N he said that what happened last week may not be enough of an adjustment 
 there 's either more to come or an extremely long period of <unk> 
 but investors do n't seem to think so 
 several big mutual fund groups said last week that cash flows into stock funds were heavier than usual after heavy outflows on the 13th 
 vanguard group said it had a more than $ N million net <unk> into its stock funds last week 
 there certainly has n't been a panic reaction said steven <unk> a vice president at t. rowe price associates 
 people showed some staying power and in fact interest in buying equities

 mr. mcdonough believes that the <unk> of the planet depends on such <unk> as opening windows to cut <unk> air pollution <unk> down carpets instead of using toxic <unk> and avoiding <unk> which comes from endangered rain <unk>

 does n't anybody here want to win this mayor 's race 
 as they <unk> and <unk> toward election day two weeks from tomorrow both democrat david dinkins and republican rudolph giuliani are in trouble 
 mr. dinkins the manhattan borough president can afford more <unk> and <unk> because he holds a comfortable <unk> lead in most of the <unk> polls 
 but in the past N days he has taken a series of body <unk> to his pride and his reputation that could <unk> affect his ability to govern this tumultuous city should he become new york 's first black mayor 
 ordinarily a <unk> opponent would find a way to capitalize on the other side 's <unk> 
 but mr. giuliani a <unk> prosecutor has had difficulty switching from his <unk> <unk> mode to a political stance that suggests he might know something about running this big troubled city 
 and now at the crucial moment he 's running out of money 
 this is the nation 's biggest city and traditionally its mayor is the nation 's best-known urban politician 
 democrats hoped that mr. dinkins could become a highly visible national leader 
 republicans figured that in mr. giuliani the nation 's best-known prosecutor they had a chance for a huge upset in the heart of democratic territory and that they would pick up a new political star 
 but it has n't worked out that way 
 dinkins is a decent but sloppy guy says david <unk> veteran campaign consultant here who has always worked for mayor edward koch defeated by mr. dinkins in the sept. N democratic primary 
 the alternative giuliani is <unk> 
 i guess we 'll <unk> go ahead and do it vote for dinkins says richard wade a politically active professor who supported richard <unk> an <unk> in the democratic primary 
 there 's nothing on the other side 
 we 're picking up steam insists roger <unk> mr. giuliani 's media consultant whose last big campaign helped put george bush in the white house 
 he adds it just has n't gotten down to the engine room yet 
 but the steam may never reach the engine room 
 for just as mr. giuliani <unk> on to an issue that has mr. dinkins reeling his campaign desperately needs cash to keep mr. <unk> 's commercials on the air beyond wednesday or thursday 
 to help out this week the white house is <unk> chief of staff john <unk> and three cabinet members hud 's jack kemp transportation 's samuel skinner and treasury 's nicholas brady according to peter powers the giuliani campaign manager 
 for republicans who began this campaign with such high hopes all of this is deeply frustrating 
 historically new york is almost always in trouble 
 but the trouble it faces now under democratic rule seems bigger and more <unk> than anything it has faced in the past 
 this year the city faces a budget deficit that could become even bigger next year 
 and hardly surprising many residents trying to cope with the city 's other problems are constantly on edge one ethnic group <unk> with another 
 people were n't so happy in the 1930s says thomas <unk> another local professor and the <unk> of the legendary <unk> <unk> the city 's fusion mayor who built a coalition mr. giuliani hopes to <unk> 
 but at least back then they did n't generally direct their anger at each other

 i <unk> you to come up with one major <unk> of david dinkins says mr. giuliani 
 he defeated the contentious mr. koch in the democratic primary partly because he seemed to offer hope he could <unk> the city 's racial and ethnic <unk> 
 his <unk> campaign is almost <unk> all <unk> pictures and <unk> words 
 his theme is unity <unk> <unk> bringing new york together again 
 both candidates are negotiating about holding debates but mr. dinkins is widely seen as the major obstacle for scheduling them 
 the 45-year-old mr. giuliani has run a negative campaign to pick up votes <unk> to mr. dinkins 
 he 's got to get dinkins 's <unk> up says lee <unk> director of the <unk> college institute of public opinion 
 but our polls show voters do n't like the attack stuff 
 why even N N of the republican vote is going to dinkins 
 it 's <unk> politics says john <unk> mr. dinkins 's issues director insisting there is a strong <unk> <unk> to the giuliani effort 
 for the giuliani forces it 's a <unk> 
 on the one hand mr. giuliani wants to cut into mr. dinkins 's credibility 
 on the other he seeks to convince voters he 's the new <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and ready to lead new york out of the mess it 's in 
 it has n't helped that he 's <unk> on abortion and <unk> rights sought the support of both the liberal and conservative parties he won the liberal endorsement and that he turned to <unk> <unk> mason for help with jewish voters 
 mr. mason left the campaign after telling reporters mr. dinkins is a <unk> with a <unk> 
 <unk> is a <unk> <unk> word for a black person 
 mr. dinkins concedes nothing in his ability to <unk> and <unk> 
 he can match <unk> mason with his own robert <unk> carson an angry street <unk> who was convicted of <unk> in N 
 the dinkins campaign paid mr. carson close to $ N to get out the vote on <unk> day 
 paper work on how it was spent is incomplete 
 mr. carson has been charged with being <unk> 
 asked about that the other day he replied <unk> 
 i 'm <unk> 
 more troubling for mr. dinkins is his record in personal accounting 
 it began in N when he was being considered for deputy mayor and a routine check <unk> the extraordinary fact that he had n't paid his income tax for the previous four years 
 i was always going to do it tomorrow he explained at the time 
 and now he 's <unk> trying to explain an arrangement in which he sold stock in inner city broadcasting co. headed by his old friend and <unk> <unk> sutton to his son david dinkins jr. for $ N 
 he had valued the shares at more than $ N million two years earlier 
 he says he sold the stock to avoid <unk> problems in his role as a voting member of the city 's board of estimate 
 he says his son has n't paid for the shares 
 it looks like serious tax evasion says mr. <unk> the giuliani media consultant 
 it follows the same pattern as his tax returns 
 he <unk> to talk about it until after he gets caught 
 he simply has n't explained why something worth a million dollars ended up worth $ N two years later says mr. powers the giuliani campaign manager 
 it 's <unk> for him to suggest it 's the difference between <unk> value of the shares and their market value 
 so far though no one not even former u.s. attorney giuliani has been able to pinpoint just what law mr. dinkins has broken or just what tax he has <unk> 
 the crime goes to character says ron <unk> a consultant to the giuliani campaign 
 it 's serious stuff 
 he <unk> and ducks 
 he 's had a history of <unk> and this is the latest chapter 
 it makes people think maybe this guy is n't so <unk> clean after all says mr. <unk> mayor koch 's media consultant 
 the result may turn out to be a lot closer than people think

 winnebago industries inc. battered by a <unk> slowdown in recreational vehicle industry sales reported a widened fourth-quarter loss and slashed its dividend in half 
 the forest city iowa maker of motor homes said it had a loss of $ N million or N cents a share in the quarter ended aug. N 
 a year earlier the company had a deficit of $ N million or six cents a share 
 the cut in the dividend to N cents a share <unk> from N cents would indicate to me they do n't see the problems being fixed real quick said frank <unk> an analyst at <unk> <unk> inc. in minneapolis 
 indeed winnebago said it started several promotional programs to spur retail sales in the fall and winter 
 the year was already shaping up as a difficult one for the recreational vehicle industry which makes products such as motor homes travel <unk> <unk> <unk> and van <unk> 
 with the exception of van <unk> the industry has seen a decline from N 's robust sales 
 but the rate of the decline <unk> in august with unit sales to dealers for the month down N N from a year earlier according to the recreation vehicle industry association 
 at winnebago sales for the quarter fell N N to $ N million from $ N million a year earlier 
 the company attributed the decline to consumers ' concern over interest rates and gas prices two key expenses for <unk> buyers 
 it 's a <unk> discretionary purchase said robert <unk> who follows the industry for merrill lynch & co 
 so when there 's talk and concern about the economy it 's not <unk> for a portion of the buying public to defer purchases 
 mr. <unk> expects industry <unk> sales for all of N to fall about N N from N when sales of N units were the highest since N 
 and he said the weakness could continue in the first half of next year 
 but he said the industry has a good decade ahead particularly if aging baby boomers fulfill the industry 's dreams by buying <unk> 
 winnebago was hit especially hard in the latest downturn because unit sales in its bread-and-butter motor home business tumbled N N industrywide in august and N N in the first eight months of the year 
 the company said it also suffered in the quarter from incentive programs losses from <unk> a motor home line and costs of developing a new commercial vehicle among other things 
 the news sent winnebago stock falling N cents to $ N in new york stock exchange composite trading a 52-week low 
 the dividend cut will prove most costly for john k. hanson winnebago 's founder and chairman 
 based on his control of about N N of winnebago 's N million shares his annual dividend income would be cut to about $ N million from $ N million 
 for the year winnebago had a loss of $ N million or N cents a share following profit of $ N million or N cents a share a year earlier 
 sales rose N N to $ N million from $ N million 
 bullish bond market sentiment is on the rise again 
 as the government prepares to release the next batch of economic reports the consensus among economists and money managers is that the news will be negative 
 and that they say will be good for bonds 
 recent data have indicated somewhat weaker economic activity said elliott <unk> director of economic research at donaldson lufkin & jenrette securities 
 mr. <unk> is advising clients that the near-term direction of bond prices is likely to remain upward 
 analysts insist that even without help from a shaky stock market which provided a temporary boost for bonds during the oct. N stock market plunge bond prices will start to climb on the prospects that the federal reserve will allow interest rates to move lower in the coming weeks 
 that would be <unk> to fixed-income investors many of whom were badly burned in the third quarter by incorrectly assuming that the fed would ease 
 investors rushed to buy bonds during the summer as prices soared on speculation that interest rates would continue to fall 
 but when it became clear that rates had stabilized and that the fed 's <unk> policy was on hold bond yields jumped and prices tumbled 
 long-term bonds have performed <unk> this year 
 for example a group of long-term treasury bonds tracked by merrill lynch & co. produced a total return of N N in the first quarter N N in the second quarter and N N in the third quarter 
 total return is price changes plus interest income 
 now some investment analysts insist that the economic climate has turned cold and gloomy and they are urging clients to buy bonds before the rally begins 
 among other things economists note that consumer spending is slowing corporate profit margins are being squeezed business confidence is slipping and construction and manufacturing industries are depressed 
 at the same time last week 's consumer price index showed that inflation is <unk> 
 add it all up and it means that the fed has a little <unk> to ease its credit policy stance without the risk of <unk> inflation said norman robertson chief economist at mellon bank corp. pittsburgh 
 i think we will see a federal funds rate of close to N N N in the next two weeks and N N by year end 
 the federal funds rate which banks charge each other on overnight loans is considered an early signal of changes in the fed 's credit policy 
 economists generally agree that the rate was lowered by the fed from around N N where it had been since july to about N N N in early october on the heels of a weak employment report 
 although the rate briefly drifted even lower following the stock market sell-off that occurred oct. N it ended friday at about N N N 
 james <unk> chief fixed-income strategist at merrill lynch is touting <unk> securities which he says should benefit more quickly than longer-term bonds as interest rates fall 
 given our forecast for lower rates purchases made now should prove quite rewarding before year end he said 
 mr. <unk> also likes long-term investment-grade corporate bonds and long-term treasurys 
 he says these bonds should appreciate in value as some investors reacting to the recent turmoil in the stock and high-yield junk bond markets seek safer securities 
 if the tennessee valley authority sale is any guide there appears to be good demand for <unk> long-term paper from both domestic and overseas accounts he said 
 tva in its first public debt offering in N years sold $ N billion of long-term and <unk> securities last week 
 strong investor demand prompted the utility to boost the size of the issue from $ N billion 
 tva which operates one of the nation 's largest electric power systems is a corporation owned by the federal government 
 but <unk> investors to buy bonds may be especially tough this week when the u.s. government will auction more than $ N billion of new securities 
 today the treasury department will sell $ N billion of three-month and six-month bills at the regular weekly auction 
 tomorrow the treasury will sell $ N billion of two-year notes 
 resolution funding corp. known as refcorp a division of a new government agency created to bail out the nation 's troubled savings and loan associations will hold its first bond auction wednesday when it will sell $ N billion of 30-year bonds 
 all of this comes ahead of the government 's big quarterly refunding of the federal debt which takes place sometime in november 
 so far investors have n't shown much appetite for refcorp 's initial bond offering 
 roger early a portfolio manager at federated investors corp. said that yields on the so-called bailout bonds are n't high enough to attract his attention 
 why should i bother with something that 's an unknown for a very small pickup in yield he said 
 i 'm not going to jump on them the first day they come out 
 he seems to be typical of many professional money managers 
 when the size of the refcorp offering was announced last week and when-issued trading activity began the bailout bonds were yielding about N percentage point more than the treasury 's benchmark 30-year bond 
 on friday the yield was quoted at about N percentage point higher than the benchmark bond an indication of weak demand 
 some economists believe that yields on all treasury securities may rise this week as the market struggles to absorb the new supply 
 but once the new securities are <unk> they expect investors to focus on the weak economic data 
 the supply is not a <unk> to the market said samuel <unk> chief financial economist at kleinwort benson government securities inc 
 if one thinks that rates are going down you do n't care how much supply is coming 
 friday 's market activity 
 most bond prices fell on concerns about this week 's new supply and disappointment that stock prices did n't stage a sharp decline 
 junk bond prices moved higher however 
 in early trading treasury bonds were higher on expectations that a surge in buying among japanese investors would continue 
 also providing support to treasurys was hope that the stock market might see declines because of the expiration of some stock-index futures and options on indexes and individual stocks 
 those hopes were dashed when the stock market put in a relatively quiet performance 
 treasury bonds ended with losses of as much as N point or about $ N for each $ N face amount 
 the benchmark 30-year bond which traded as high as N N during the day ended at N N 
 the yield on the benchmark bond rose slightly to N N from N N 
 in the corporate bond market traders said the new-issue market for junk bonds is likely to pick up following chicago & north western acquisition corp. 's $ N million junk bond offering friday 
 today for example underwriters at morgan stanley & co. said they expect to price a $ N million 12-year senior subordinated debenture offering by imo industries inc 
 traders expect the issue to be priced to yield N N 
 shearson lehman hutton inc. said that a $ N million senior subordinated discount debenture issue by <unk> <unk> drugs is expected by the end of the month 
 however despite the big new-issue calendar many junk bond investors and analysts are skeptical the deals will get done 
 there are about a dozen more deals coming said michael <unk> director of fixed-income research at kemper financial services inc 
 if they had this much trouble with chicago & north western they are going to have an awful time with the rest 
 last week underwriters were forced to postpone three junk bond deals because of recent weakness in the market 
 and pressure by big investors forced donaldson lufkin & jenrette securities corp. to <unk> chicago & north western 's $ N million junk bond offering 
 after hours of negotiating that stretched late into thursday night underwriters priced the 12-year issue of <unk> senior subordinated debentures at par to yield N N higher than the N N that had been expected 
 the coupon on the issue will be reset in one year at a rate that will give the issue a market value of N 
 however the maximum coupon rate on the issue when it is reset is N N 
 debenture holders also will receive the equivalent of N N of the common stock in chicago & north western 's parent company 
 the coupon was raised to induce some of the big players on the <unk> to come in said a spokesman for donaldson 
 we put a price on the deal that the market required to get it done 
 the spokesman said the issue was sold out and met with strong interest abroad particularly from japanese investors 
 in the secondary or resale market junk bonds closed N point higher while investment-grade corporate bonds fell N to N point 
 sotheby 's inc. 's gamble in the <unk> business appears to have paid off 
 the new york arm of the london-based auction house auctioned off the estate of john t. dorrance jr. the campbell 's soup co. heir for $ N million last week a record for a <unk> art collection 
 that total was below the $ N million the auction house estimated the collection might sell for but was enough to ensure that an unprecedented financial arrangement sotheby 's had made with the dorrance family proved profitable to the auction house 
 sotheby 's provided the dorrance family a guarantee of at least $ N million and as much as $ N million to obtain the collection people familiar with the transaction said thus taking a greater than usual financial interest in the property to be sold 
 the dorrance estate auctioned off in a series of sales held over four days included <unk> furniture and paintings 
 an <unk> <unk> auctioned last wednesday <unk> $ N million a world record for the artist 
 in addition a handful of paintings from the dorrance collection remain to be sold at sotheby 's annual old masters paintings auction in january 
 the better business bureau of san diego and the state attorney general 's office entered into a settlement stemming from an investigation of <unk> business <unk> published by an outside firm better book inc

 without admitting any <unk> the bureau agreed to several conditions if it again contracts with an outside firm to publish its <unk> 
 the conditions include not <unk> how many <unk> will be distributed and agreeing to make refunds to <unk> advertisers if any <unk> are involved in the sale 
 the attorney general 's investigation was sparked by lawsuits and charges by angry california <unk> that they were <unk> in a <unk> <unk> project contracted by better book 
 the <unk> led to the closing of the los angeles better business bureau in late N 
 mccaw cellular communications inc. said it obtained firm financing commitments from three major banks in regard to its offer for N N of lin broadcasting corp

 further mccaw said the banks expressed confidence that the balance of the $ N billion bank facility will be committed within the next several weeks by a syndicate of foreign and domestic banks 
 morgan <unk> and <unk> are leading that syndicate 
 mccaw is offering to buy N million shares of lin for $ N each in cash which would result in mccaw owning N N of the <unk> and broadcasting concern 
 the offer is in limbo however because lin has agreed to merge its <unk> businesses with bellsouth corp

 a majority of japanese banks are said to be wary of making new loans to mexico under the brady plan because they 're uncertain the mexican economy will remain stable 
 instead many small and medium-sized banks and some larger ones are likely to take one of the other two options open to them under the plan japanese banking officials said 
 the plan proposed by u.s. secretary of state nicholas brady calls for banks either to make new loans or to reduce the principle on existing loans or to cut the interest rate on those existing loans 
 the officials said that most japanese banks prefer the losses they 'd suffer in either of the latter options to the risk of new lending 
 but an official at a long-term credit bank explained that since some larger banks have already taken loss provisions for loans to other third world nations further write-offs could be viewed as <unk> 
 they ca n't take the hit to their earnings he said 
 as a result the official said they may be forced into a <unk> situation in which they make risky loans that they could have to write off later

 ekco group inc. nashua n.h. expects to report that net income in the third quarter ended oct. N fell N N to N N from $ N million or N cents a share a year earlier 
 robert stein president and chief executive officer attributed the expected decline partly to the effects of a <unk> strike last month at the company 's <unk> ohio <unk> facility 
 <unk> orders in early september also played a role he said in an interview 
 but mr. stein said he is reasonably confident that earnings for the full year will exceed the $ N million or N cents a share in N 
 that would require fourth-quarter net of more than about N cents to N cents a share assuming that mr. stein 's third-quarter estimate proves accurate 
 in the year-earlier fourth quarter the company had profit of $ N million or N cents a share 
 third-quarter revenue is expected to be $ N million to $ N million up from $ N million a year earlier according to neil gordon treasurer 
 the year-earlier periods do n't reflect results of the company 's <unk> corp. unit acquired last january but include some canadian operations that were sold at the end of N 
 august through october traditionally is the busiest season for the <unk> business as many retailers use the goods as autumn promotional items 
 mr. stein said some retailers perhaps anxious about <unk> inventories appear to have held back on orders in september but have been ordering more heavily in october 
 mr. stein said <unk> is marginally profitable but has n't performed as well as expected 
 <unk> 's <unk> <unk> and other <unk> products are doing very well and its plastic <unk> products are poised for growth he said 
 but the unit 's third segment wildlife <unk> is suffering from a depressed market and ekco is seeking to sell that segment he said 
 mr. stein said he expects profit to be higher in N than in N reflecting a number of measures taken since the acquisition of ekco <unk> in late N 
 prior to acquiring the <unk> business the company was known as <unk> corp. <unk> had been a maker of computer printers but mr. stein and other officers decided to sell that business after japanese competitors grabbed a dominant share of the market 
 mr. stein said tighter operating controls have enabled ekco to reduce inventory levels N N to N N improve <unk> delivery of orders to about N N from around N N and to lower the number of labor hours required to produce a unit 
 by moving the design of new products in-house instead of contracting out the work the company also has been able to come up with designs that can be manufactured more efficiently he said 
 in addition to those measures the company spent heavily earlier this year to install displays at its customers ' retail outlets a strategy that mr. stein said has helped bolster awareness of the company 's brands 
 ekco 's <unk> operation makes kitchen tools and <unk> as well as <unk> at factories in the u.s. and canada 
 the main issue in the strike at the ohio facility was health-care benefits mr. stein said 
 the strike ended <unk> 
 ekco continues to seek further acquisitions in the consumer-products industry mr. stein said 
 he indicated that ekco may be interested in acquiring another company with revenue in the range of $ N million to $ N million partly because mass <unk> increasingly want to rely on larger and fewer suppliers 
 after several years of booming business with china foreign traders are bracing for the biggest slump in a decade 
 the <unk> of <unk> measures starting last october already had begun to <unk> when the massacre in <unk> square on june N and subsequent events <unk> the belt far tighter 
 foreign lending has been virtually suspended since then <unk> liquidity and <unk> many projects 
 and beijing has pulled back on domestic loans and subsidies leaving many domestic buyers and <unk> plants strapped for cash 
 <unk> far east ltd. a swiss concern that sells chemicals to <unk> and soap factories in china <unk> the problems

 the company 's sales <unk> during N 's first half 
 the june killings magnified the problems 
 in canton <unk> 's representative office received no orders in june 
 at first it attributed the slump to temporary business disruptions but when no orders were <unk> in august and september manager donald <unk> became convinced that business would be bad for many months 
 things have grown worse since june N mr. <unk> says 
 he predicts that sales will drop between N N and N N from last year 's $ N million 
 the consumer-products and <unk> sectors are bearing the brunt of china 's <unk> measures and foreign companies such as <unk> that deal with those industries are being hit the hardest 
 but in general all <unk> companies are feeling the <unk> 
 the import pie will shrink says john <unk> first vice president of the american chamber of commerce in hong kong and a china trade specialist 
 on the down side sales could fall as much as N N for some companies on the upper side sales will be flat 
 china 's foreign trade has gone in cycles during the past decade 
 the last time that traders experienced a trough was during N when beijing imposed tough measures to curb imports and <unk> foreign exchange 
 the current trough is expected to be much deeper because beijing has cut off domestic funds from factories for the first time to slow inflation 
 in addition the suspension of loans and export credits from foreign governments and institutions following the june killings have been a big setback 
 the freeze on new lending is dealing the single biggest blow to trading says raymond <unk> china manager for <unk> ag a west german <unk> company 
 import growth from the year-earlier months slowed to N N in july and N N in august compared with an average growth rate of N N in the first half 
 in the first eight months of N imports grew N N to $ N billion down slightly from a growth rate of N N a year earlier 
 the picture for china 's exports is just as bleak mainly because of the domestic credit squeeze 
 exports in the first eight months grew only N N to $ N billion compared with a growth rate of N N a year earlier according to chinese customs figures 
 the threat to china 's balance of payments is further <unk> by the plunge in its foreign-exchange reserves excluding gold holdings 
 the reserves dropped for the first time in recent years to $ N billion in june from $ N billion in april 
 the trend has prompted beijing to intensify efforts to curb imports 
 in recent weeks china 's leaders have <unk> trading in <unk> and scores of chemical products and commodities 
 the ministry of foreign economic relations and trade set up a special bureau last month to monitor the issue of import and export licenses 
 beijing 's periodic <unk> on imports have taught many trading companies that the best way to get through the drought is by helping china export 
 for example <unk> <unk> corp. one of the biggest japanese trading houses now buys almost twice as many goods from china as it sells to that country 
 three years ago the ratio was reversed 
 but the strategy is n't helping much this time 
 both sectors of imports and exports look just as bad says <unk> <unk> general manager of <unk> <unk> 's canton office 
 he expects the company 's trading business to drop as much as N N this year 
 for a short time after june N it appeared that the trade picture would remain fairly bright 
 many foreign trading offices in hong kong were <unk> with <unk> and telephone calls from chinese trade officials urging them not to <unk> ties 
 even the bank of china which normally took weeks to process letters of credit was settling the letters at record speed to <unk> rumors about the bank 's financial health 
 but when foreign traders tried to do business they discovered that the eagerness of chinese trade officials was just a <unk> 
 the suspension of foreign loans has weakened the buying power of china 's national trading companies which are among the country 's biggest <unk> 
 business is n't any better on the <unk> or municipal level foreign traders say 
 shanghai investment & trust co. known as <unk> is the city 's main financier for trading business 
 <unk> had <unk> tapped the japanese bond market for funds but it ca n't do that any longer 
 foreign traders say the company is strapped for cash 
 it has difficulties paying its foreign debts says a hong kong executive who is familiar with <unk> 's business 
 how can it make available funds for purchases 
 foreign traders also say many of china 's big <unk> projects have been canceled or postponed because of the squeeze on domestic and foreign credit 
 albert lee a veteran trader who specializes in machinery sales estimates that as many as N N of projects that had obtained approval to proceed have been canceled in recent months 
 there are virtually no new projects and that means no new business for us he says 
 even when new lending <unk> foreign exchange would still be tight because beijing will likely try to rein in foreign borrowing which has grown between N N and N N in the past few years 
 and foreign creditors are likely to be more cautious about extending new loans because china is <unk> a peak repayment period as many loans start falling due in the next two to five years 
 another reason for the intensity of the trade problems is that beijing has extended the current <unk> on imports beyond the usual target of consumer products to include steel chemical <unk> and plastics 
 these have been among the country 's leading imports particularly last year when there were shortages that led many traders to buy heavily and pay <unk> 
 but the shortages also spawned rampant speculation and <unk> prices 
 to stem speculation beijing imposed ceiling prices that went into effect earlier this year 
 traders who had bought the goods at prices above the ceiling do n't want to take a loss on <unk> and are holding onto their stock 
 the resulting <unk> has depressed the market 
 but beijing ca n't cut back on such essential imports as raw materials for too long without <unk> the country 's export business 
 mr. <unk> the china trade expert estimates that as much as N N of <unk> 's exports is made up of processed imported raw materials

 the fund is required to pay claims up to an additional $ N million

 but the <unk> bay case the fund 's first test shows how easily the fund can be undermined

 that means the fund is n't obligated to pay anything at least so far

 first the somewhat affected <unk> of the 1960s 
 then the <unk> <unk> of the 1970s and 1980s 
 what now 
 to judge from novels that mirror the contemporary scene we 're back in the age of anxiety 
 where <unk> <unk> <unk> to <unk> middle-class life and ambitious <unk> hoped to leave it far behind as they scaled the upper reaches of success it now seems that so many people feel they 're slipping between the cracks that middle-class life is viewed with <unk> or outright <unk> 
 <unk> <unk> 's third novel limited partnerships north point press N pages $ N is a <unk> funny and <unk> look at the way love relationships are affected by the pressures of money or more specifically the lack of it 
 nora worth and malcolm <unk> N and N respectively live together in a <unk> in a <unk> philadelphia neighborhood 
 malcolm a former <unk> turned architect has just seen his first big chance at a lucrative commission turn to dust with the arrest of his <unk> <unk> client a <unk> real estate developer 
 nora who still has artistic aspirations knows she is lucky to be working as a food <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> cold drinks and other <unk> to look as <unk> as possible in front of the camera 
 after all she reasons there were <unk> with <unk> and degrees from cooking schools in france who would kill for her job 
 but nora and malcolm feel trapped 
 they seem to be having the worst of both <unk> artistic work with none of art 's integrity and no control over the finished product <unk> without fun or profit 
 it 's a <unk> <unk> world in which bright still <unk> people are engaged in a glossy version of day labor doing free-lance <unk> work that brings little satisfaction or security but that they know they should be <unk> to do 
 uncertainty dogs every aspect of their lives 
 malcolm faces bankruptcy and an irs audit but nora finds an extra $ N in her bank account suddenly increasing her available funds some <unk> 
 while she is wondering whether to live it up and do something even more dramatic say get married her life is further complicated by the <unk> of an old <unk> david a film critic and actor who always seems to be just on the brink of <unk> 
 in novels of an earlier vintage david would have represented excitement and danger malcolm <unk> middle-class security 
 the irony in this novel is that neither man represents a safe middle-class haven nora 's decision is between emotional excitement and emotional security with no firm economic base anywhere 
 the characters <unk> a world in which it seems increasingly difficult to find a middle way between the <unk> of success and failure wealth and poverty 
 in making malcolm and nora such <unk> representative <unk> of their class and generation ms. <unk> has somewhat neglected the task of making them <unk> individual characters 
 the humor of the story owes much to the fact that no hearts even the characters ' own are likely to <unk> for the plight of <unk> <unk> 
 but readers may well feel the <unk> of recognition 
 in any case the <unk> middle classes are n't the only ones in trouble or whose troubles provide material for <unk> 
 <unk> money contemporary books N pages $ N a novel by consultant and business analyst joseph r. <unk> tells the story of an innovative <unk> widely respected computer manufacturing company called <unk> as it faces a hostile takeover attempt by <unk> a much smaller corporation that is so <unk> managed as to constitute a standing joke in the business world 
 <unk> dynamic scott thatcher founder and head of <unk> initially finds the takeover threat <unk> 
 but as he and his skilled team soon discover they 're up against two factors they had n't counted on first a business climate in which a failing company with few assets and many debts can borrow against the assets of the successful company it hopes to acquire in order to finance the takeover second that standing behind <unk> is a <unk> consortium of much bigger <unk> and <unk> foreign interests <unk> providing the money and muscle for the deal 
 mr. <unk> manages to invest this tale of financial wars with the <unk> characters and <unk> action of a <unk> novel 
 and like a spy or mystery story this novel has strong elements of <unk> as the good and evil forces battle it out 
 mr. <unk> <unk> these moral <unk> with the broad <unk> strokes of a <unk> that occasionally <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> <unk> 
 <unk> <unk> of <unk> californians <unk> <unk> and <unk> union leaders undermine the force of the author 's perceptions 
 yet the <unk> of the <unk> also can be effective in a book like this if the head of <unk> were not portrayed as an utterly <unk> <unk> <unk> we would not much care whether his schemes were defeated and would not be so diverted in the process 
 ms. rubin is a free-lance writer based in los angeles 
 high-definition television promises to be the tv of tomorrow so it is a natural multibillion-dollar market 
 although major u.s. manufacturers have all but <unk> the main segment of that future business to japan not everyone here is ready to give up 
 a handful of small u.s. companies are struggling to develop the technology to build the screens for the thin high-quality <unk> that are expected to hang on living room walls by the end of the 1990s 
 with only small help from the government these start-up concerns are trying to compete with the <unk> of the japanese consumer electronics industry which enjoy considerable backing from the japanese government 
 <unk> technology inc. of <unk> ohio aims to use a new form of <unk> technology to put <unk> images on a tv display that is N inches in <unk> but only a few inches thick 
 <unk> systems inc. of <unk> ore. the largest of these firms with $ N million in annual revenue has similar plans 
 it already has had success in <unk> another promising technology <unk> for high-definition television 
 two other firms <unk> <unk> systems inc. of <unk> mich. and <unk> corp. of pittsburgh are developing a <unk> of the <unk> screens called <unk> liquid crystal displays 
 the new technologies are intended to retire the <unk> tube which accounts for most of the bulk of the conventional tv set 
 replacing the <unk> tube with a large thin screen is the key to the creation of a high-definition television or hdtv which is expected to become a $ N billion business world-wide within a decade 
 large u.s. companies are interested in other segments of the hdtv business such as <unk> and broadcast equipment 
 but except for zenith electronics corp. and international business machines corp. which is <unk> with toshiba on computer displays they are poorly positioned to exploit advances in large panels 
 general electric co. recently sold off its interests in <unk> displays to <unk> of france 
 we found the market not developing as we thought it would a ge spokesman says 
 the small u.s. firms are <unk> because of their strong positions in patents and because the prize is still there to be seized 
 no one yet has shown the ability to manufacture these panels at commercial costs says <unk> <unk> the president of <unk> <unk> 
 he says he thinks his company is just a few years from doing that 
 the bush administration hearing <unk> advice about what its role in hdtv should be is n't doing much for now 
 the only material support it is extending to the struggling u.s. industry is $ N million in <unk> from the pentagon 's defense advanced research projects agency 
 the <unk> funds are a <unk> compared with what japan and other prospective competitors are spending 
 the commerce department estimates that japanese government and industry spending on hdtv research is already over $ N billion 
 unless it gets more help the u.s. industry wo n't have a chance says peter <unk> <unk> 's executive vice president 
 thus far almost all of the basic technology relating to high-definition television has come from u.s. laboratories 
 but peter <unk> <unk> 's president says japanese companies are poised to <unk> the technology and put it to commercial use just as they did with earlier u.s. <unk> in color television and video recording 
 in the 1970s mr. <unk> helped develop the first display panels based on <unk> liquid crystals at westinghouse electric corp. 's research labs in pittsburgh 
 the panels are like <unk> semiconductors surfaced with a million or more picture elements each contributing to the color and tone of a tv image 
 in N however westinghouse abandoned the project along with its stake in advanced television 
 mr. <unk> left the company to find other backers 
 he has a claim to the right to <unk> the westinghouse patents but he contends that those patents are being infringed by a number of japanese producers 
 most american investors have just given up mr. <unk> says 
 they are n't prepared to compete in an area where the japanese want to enter 
 many critics question the industry 's need for federal support the pentagon justifies its help on <unk> grounds 
 we do n't see a domestic source for some of our hdtv requirements and that 's a source of concern says michael kelly director of <unk> 's defense manufacturing office 
 so <unk> is trying to keep the industry interested in developing large display panels by <unk> out research funds 
 hdtv already has some military applications such as creating realistic flight <unk> and <unk> information to combat <unk> 
 the navy is ordering displays for its <unk> <unk> and the army wants smaller versions for its abrams battle tanks 
 the commerce department also is trying to encourage hdtv because of the benefits that could spin off to the semiconductor and computer industries 
 it is n't just <unk> television argues jack clifford director of the department 's office of <unk> and instrumentation 
 the industry will create industrial products such as displays for work stations and medical diagnostic equipment before it acquires a mass consumer market 
 although some hdtv advocates are calling for other forms of aid such as antitrust relief for research <unk> the small firms simply would prefer more <unk> funds 
 each claims to <unk> the right technology and wants just a bit more money to make it commercial 
 they also want u.s. trade policy to reflect the pentagon and commerce department 's concern over their future 
 they all are strongly opposed to a petition from several japanese tv manufacturers including <unk> hitachi and toshiba to exempt portable color tvs with <unk> displays from <unk> duties that the u.s. imposes on the larger japanese color tvs 
 and they want the u.s. to help them sell overseas 
 <unk> president james <unk> says he has to pay tariffs as high as N N to sell his display panels in japan and south korea while panels from those countries enter the u.s. duty-free 
 this is n't a technology issue but an attitude issue he says 
 we just have n't learned what it takes to compete 
 burmah oil plc a british independent oil and <unk> marketing concern said shv holdings n.v. has built up a N N stake in the company

 the office of thrift supervision banned <unk> <unk> a former director of the failed vision banc savings association of <unk> texas from working in any financial institution insured by the government 
 the office a treasury department unit that is the successor to the federal home loan bank board said this was the first announcement of an enforcement action since this year 's <unk> legislation ordered that all such actions by federal banking regulators be made public 
 generally regulators have n't announced enforcement actions in the past 
 indeed the <unk> said that before the law took effect aug. N it banned another key vision banc insider from insured financial institutions 
 that individual was n't identified 
 vision banc was placed in government conservatorship in march and it operates under the control of the resolution trust corp. the agency created to sell or liquidate insolvent thrifts 
 the <unk> did n't say specifically why the action was taken against ms. <unk>

 growth is good 
 at least that 's a theme emerging among many money managers who are anxious both to preserve the <unk> stock-market gains they have already achieved this year and to catch the next wave of <unk> performers 
 they are starting to buy growth stocks 
 remember them 
 the upper <unk> of this group were shares of the <unk> N companies whose profits of the 1960s and early 1970s grew steadily if not <unk> through thick and thin 
 that sort of <unk> performance sounds made to order for a time when corporate profits overall have been weakening from the brisk increases of recent years 
 the current flood of third-quarter reports are producing many more negative surprises than positive ones 
 those are unwelcome trends in a year that the dow jones industrial average has risen N N so far even with the 190.58-point plunge on oct. N broader market measures are in the same neighborhood 
 the question for investors is how to protect these returns and yet reach a little for additional gains 
 that 's the path of <unk> leading to growth stocks 
 i think it is a good theme for what looks to be an uncertain market says steven einhorn partner at goldman sachs 
 growth stocks may be as big as philip morris or medium-sized such as circuit city stores but their common characteristic is a history of increasing profits on the order of at least N N to N N a year money managers say 
 the period when growth stocks should be performing well is when their earnings are growing at a superior rate to the general level of corporate profits says stephen boesel president of t. rowe price 's growth and income fund 
 growth stocks also are attractive in periods of market volatility which many investors and analysts expect in the weeks ahead as everybody tries to <unk> where the economy is heading

 one of the stories of the fourth quarter is that we will get an unusual number of earnings disappointments from companies sensitive to the economy says mr. boesel of t. rowe price

 he recently trimmed his portfolio of international paper dow chemical quantum chemical international business machines and digital equipment

 big cyclical companies are using all the <unk> they can to stabilize earnings says mr. sloan 
 he cites ibm which reported a N N earnings decline in the third quarter and which last week announced a $ N billion buy-back of its shares 
 what they are telling you is that they do n't have the ability to generate higher returns <unk> says mr. sloan 
 when they are buying back stock at N times earnings they are suggesting that the rate of return on competing internal projects is below returns on the stock 
 ibm says it considers its shares a good investment 
 but not all strategists or money managers are ready to throw in the towel completely on <unk> 
 growth stocks may <unk> cyclical stocks next year if the federal reserve begins to let interest rates <unk> sufficiently lower to boost the economy 
 goldman sachs 's mr. einhorn for one <unk> to that scenario 
 he suggests investors think about buying cyclical shares in the weeks ahead as well as growth issues

 the collapse of a $ N billion buy-out of united airlines parent ual corp. has handed wall street 's takeover stock speculators their worst loss ever on a single deal 
 their $ N <unk> in estimated paper losses easily tops the $ N million in paper losses the takeover traders known as arbitragers suffered in N when gulf oil co. dropped a $ N billion offer for cities service co 
 in the six trading days since the ual labor-management buy-out group failed to get bank financing <unk> friday with the withdrawal of its partner british airways plc ual stock has plummeted by N N to N N from N N 
 the <unk> may recoup some of their paper losses if the ual deal gets <unk> up again as they did in N when occidental petroleum co. <unk> them with a $ N billion takeover of cities service 
 in the meantime the question faced by investors is what is ual stock worth 
 the short answer on a fundamental basis is that airline analysts say the stock is worth somewhere between $ N and $ N a share 
 that 's based on a multiple of anywhere between N to N times ual earnings which are estimated to come in somewhere around $ N a share this year 
 airline stocks typically sell at a discount of about one-third to the stock market 's price-earnings ratio which is currently about N times earnings 
 that 's because airline earnings like those of auto makers have been subject to the cyclical <unk> of the economy 
 that analysis matches up with stock traders ' reports that despite the huge drop in the stock ual has n't returned to the level at which it could attract buying by institutions solely on the basis of earnings 
 so anyone buying the stock now is betting on some special transaction such as a recapitalization or takeover and must do so using some <unk> about the likelihood of such an event 
 one analyst who asked not to be identified said he believes that the ual pilots and management can put together a bid in the $ N area but that it could take three to four months to close 
 at that level and given the uncertainty he believes ual stock should trade closer to 
 other observers note that ual 's board having accepted a bid of $ N a share might hold out for a new bid much closer to the original level even if it means that the management goes back to running the company for a while and lets things return to normal 
 by that logic the closing of a deal could be much further away than three to four months even though the eventual price might be higher 
 investment bankers following ual agree that the strongest impetus for an eventual deal is that the pilots have been attempting a buy-out for more than two years and are n't likely to stop having come so close to success 
 the pilots have a strong financing tool in their willingness to cut their annual compensation by $ N million and to commit $ N million from their retirement funds 
 on friday they also persuaded the ual flight attendants to join them 
 however investment bankers say that banks are n't likely to lend the almost $ N billion that would be necessary for a takeover even at a lower price without someone putting up a hefty <unk> of cash probably even greater than the N N in cash put up by investors in the leveraged takeover of northwest airlines parent nwa corp. in july 
 banks want to see someone putting up real cash at risk that is subordinate to the bank debt in any deal 
 that way they figure someone else has an even stronger <unk> to make sure the deal is going to work because they would be losing their money before the banks lost theirs 
 banks also want to be able to call someone on the telephone to fix a problem with a deal that goes bad <unk> someone other than a union leader 
 that leaves the pilots still in need of cash totaling around $ N billion far more than either they or the flight attendants can lay their hands on from retirement funds alone 
 one obstacle to the pilots ' finding such a huge amount of cash is their insistence on majority ownership 
 investors such as marvin davis of los angeles who have sought airline ownership this year have insisted they not the pilots must have control 
 one way out of that dilemma could be a partial recapitalization in which the pilots would wind up sharing the value of their concessions with public shareholders 
 the pilots could borrow against the value of their concessions using the proceeds to buy back stock from the public and give themselves the majority control they have been seeking 
 but it is n't clear that banks would lend sufficient money to deliver a big enough price to shareholders 
 the lack of any new cash probably would still leave the banks <unk> 
 in advising the ual board on the various bids for the airline starting with one for $ N a share from mr. davis the investment bank of first boston came up with a wide range of potential values for the company depending on <unk> methods and assumptions 
 using the the nwa takeover as a benchmark first boston on sept. N estimated that ual was worth $ N to $ N a share based on ual 's results for the N months ending last june N but only $ N to $ N based on a management estimate of results for N 
 first boston 's estimates had been higher before management supplied a N projection 
 using estimates of the company 's future earnings under a variety of scenarios first boston estimated ual 's value at $ N to $ N a share if its future labor costs conform to wall street projections $ N to $ N if the company reaches a settlement with pilots similar to one at nwa $ N to $ N under an adverse labor settlement and $ N to $ N under a pilot contract imposed by the company following a strike 
 and using liquidation value assuming the sale of all ual assets first boston estimated the airline is worth $ N to $ N a share 
 unfortunately all those estimates came before airline industry fundamentals deteriorated during the past month 
 american airlines parent amr and usair group both subject to takeover efforts themselves have each warned of declining results 
 some analysts do n't expect a quick revival of any takeover by the pilots 
 the deal has as one takeover expert puts it so many moving parts 
 i do n't see anybody who 's sophisticated getting his name associated with this mess until the moving parts stop moving 
 in addition to the need for another cash equity investor the other moving parts include the pilots themselves who can scuttle rival deals by threatening to strike the machinists union the pilots ' longtime rivals who helped scuttle the pilots ' deal and regulators in washington whose opposition to foreign airline investment helped throw the deal into doubt

 troubled saatchi & saatchi co. has attracted offers for some of its advertising units with potential suitors including interpublic group but has rejected them people familiar with the company said 
 industry executives said interpublic approached saatchi in august about buying its <unk> unit but was turned down by chairman maurice saatchi 
 more recently interpublic <unk> about one of saatchi 's smaller communications companies identified as the <unk> public relations firm by several industry executives but again was rebuffed they said 
 interpublic 's chairman and chief executive officer philip <unk> jr. made the pitches in visits to mr. saatchi in london the executives said 
 a saatchi spokesman declined to comment about interpublic 
 but the spokesman confirmed that saatchi has received several inquiries from companies interested in acquiring its <unk> and <unk> units 
 he added we have no intention of selling either business 
 interpublic declined comment 
 the offers come as saatchi is struggling through the most troubled period in its <unk> history 
 takeover speculation has been <unk> its consulting business is on the block and its largest shareholder <unk> asset management has said it 's been approached by third parties regarding a possible restructuring

 it rebuffed an offer by carl spielvogel head of saatchi 's backer spielvogel bates unit to lead a management buy-out of all or part of saatchi 
 and last week people close to saatchi said maurice saatchi and his brother charles would lead a buy-out if a hostile bid emerged 
 but saatchi 's troubles have only <unk> up interest among outsiders interested in picking off pieces of its ad businesses 
 while saatchi 's major agency networks backer spielvogel and saatchi & saatchi advertising would be difficult for any ad firm to buy because of potential client conflicts its smaller businesses are quite attractive 
 <unk> for example has had big problems at its new york office but offers strong offices in other areas of the country including minneapolis and chicago 
 that would would make it appealing to a network such as interpublic that already has a healthy new york presence 
 while there would be some client conflicts they would n't be nearly as onerous as with saatchi 's other agencies 
 <unk> also would be a sizable addition to an agency network it has billings of about $ N million and blue-chip clients including general mills <unk> and dow brands 
 <unk> meanwhile has expanded aggressively and now ranks as the <unk> u.s. public relations firm according to <unk> <unk> of public relations firms 
 it would be attractive to an agency such as interpublic one of the few big agency groups without an affiliated public relations firm of its own 
 other saatchi units include ad agency <unk> & mccall which has the mercedes account and which has been attempting to buy itself back and howard <unk> a sports and event marketing firm

 both of dr. baltimore 's public faces have been on view the past few weeks while he was under consideration to succeed <unk> <unk> as head of the prestigious rockefeller research institution 
 it came to light that a substantial number of rockefeller 's faculty were upset over or even opposed to dr. baltimore 's impending appointment 
 they were <unk> at what they regarded as dr. baltimore 's <unk> attitude toward the dingell committee which held hearings on a dispute over the lab <unk> of a researcher who had <unk> a scientific paper with dr. baltimore 
 readers of these columns the science police may N will recall that dr. baltimore was merely the most well-known part of the dingell committee 's larger investigation which touched mit <unk> duke the national institutes of health and elsewhere 
 rep. dingell even managed to <unk> the services of the secret service in his investigation of the baltimore paper

 we see a whole <unk> of programs that will impose significant costs on the american economy in the form of <unk> regulation and higher liabilities 
 federal child care quack 
 the clean air bill quack 
 the <unk> bill quack quack 
 the bush white house is breeding <unk> ducks the same way the nixon white house did it <unk> on an issue that is <unk> cleaner air better treatment of the disabled better child care 
 it comes up with a <unk> version of a democratic proposal 
 the bill gets signed into law and then the administration watches <unk> wondering where all the unexpected costs came from 
 consider for instance the very fat <unk> known as <unk> child care 
 the president came up with a good bill but now may end up signing the awful bureaucratic <unk> <unk> on capitol hill 
 it would create N local <unk> commissions <unk> to the department of health and human services 
 they 'd determine where parents could store their kids during the day and they 'd regulate the storage facilities 
 the initial costs are said to be in the $ N billion a year range but that 's only the beginning 
 new <unk> tend to grow creating a rationale for new taxes 
 quack 
 the administration claims that its clean air bill will cost businesses between $ N billion and $ N billion annually but economist michael evans estimates that the costs for firms will actually be in the $ N billion a year range 
 the house bill also <unk> economic efficiency in all sorts of <unk> ways 
 for example the administration proposal imposes extremely tough emissions standards on new power plants 
 so instead of building more efficient modern plants utilities stick <unk> on the old plants 
 the money spent on <unk> is diverted from planned research on new cleaner technology 
 the bill also imposes the california <unk> standards on all cars nationwide as if a car registered in big sky <unk> needed to be as clean as one driven in los angeles

 the effect of nixon era <unk> ducks was an economy <unk> up with regulations and <unk> 
 all this was recognized and <unk> in the succeeding years by economists some of whom worked in the reagan administration to lift this burden from the american people states and local governments 
 running for president in N and N george bush also <unk> <unk> the economic <unk> of the 1970s 
 in fact during last year 's campaign the entire nation constantly heard mr. bush <unk> his <unk> as head of the task force on regulatory relief 
 government continues to inhibit the productivity of our <unk> and the international competitiveness of american business the vice president declared when he was head of the task force 
 but with the impending passage of these new programs mr. bush will surely be sending many people <unk> back into the regulatory <unk> that he had helped cut back 
 by N the number of federal regulators was down to about N 
 then it turned up and by one estimate the number will be up to about N regulators by next year 
 holding the dam on taxes is the most important task of the bush presidency 
 we would have thought by now though that there was a significant core of people involved in government life who understood that direct taxation is n't the only way to slow down an economy 
 it is merely the most obvious 
 what is even more ironic is that all over the world nations are learning that <unk> public programs often <unk> 
 but while they are unloading these burdens the united states is close to creating three more big ones 
 the bush administration ought to be setting aside some of its <unk> for the <unk> ducks 
 confidence in the pound is widely expected to take another sharp dive if trade figures for september due for release tomorrow fail to show a substantial improvement from july and august 's <unk> deficits 
 chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson 's restated commitment to a firm monetary policy has helped to prevent a <unk> in sterling over the past week 
 but analysts <unk> underlying support for sterling has been eroded by the chancellor 's failure to announce any new policy measures in his mansion house speech last thursday 
 this has increased the risk of the government being forced to increase base rates to N N from their current N N level to defend the pound economists and foreign exchange market analysts say 
 the risks for sterling of a bad trade figure are very heavily on the down side said chris <unk> senior u.k. economist at nomura research institute 
 if there is another bad trade number there could be an awful lot of pressure noted simon <unk> u.k. economist for midland <unk> a unit of midland bank plc 
 forecasts for the trade figures range widely but few economists expect the data to show a very marked improvement from the # N billion $ N billion deficit in the current account reported for august 
 the august deficit and the # N billion gap registered in july are topped only by the # N billion deficit of october N 
 <unk> <unk> european economist at baring brothers & co. said there is no sign that britain 's manufacturing industry is <unk> itself to boost exports 
 at the same time he remains fairly pessimistic about the outlook for imports given continued high consumer and capital goods inflows 
 he <unk> the current account deficit will narrow to only # N billion in september 
 however mr. <unk> said he believes that a reduction in raw material <unk> by industry could lead to a sharp drop in imports 
 combined with at least some rebound in exports after august 's unexpected decline the deficit could narrow to as little as # N billion 
 mr. <unk> who also forecasts a # N billion current account gap warns that even if the trade figures are bullish for sterling the currency wo n't advance much because investors will want to see further evidence of the turnaround before adjusting positions 
 nevertheless he noted no one will want to go into the trade figures without a flat position in the pound 
 meanwhile overall evidence on the economy remains fairly <unk> 
 in his mansion house speech mr. lawson warned that a further slowdown can be expected as the impact of the last rise in interest rates earlier this month takes effect 
 u.k. base rates are at their highest level in eight years 
 but consumer expenditure data released friday do n't suggest that the u.k. economy is slowing that quickly 
 the figures show that spending rose N N in the third quarter from the second quarter and was up N N from a year ago 
 this compares with a N N rise in the second from the first quarter and a N N increase from the second quarter of N 
 mr. <unk> said the data show the economy is still quite strong but suggestions that much of the spending went on services rather than consumer goods should reduce fears of more import rises 
 certainly the chancellor has made it clear that he is prepared to increase interest rates again if necessary to both ensure that a substantial slowdown does take place and that sterling does n't decline further 
 thursday he reminded his audience that the government can not allow the necessary <unk> of monetary policy to be undermined by exchange rate weakness 
 analysts agree there is little holding sterling firm at the moment other than mr. lawson 's promise that rates will be pushed higher if necessary 
 and they warn any further drop in the government 's popularity could swiftly make this promise sound <unk> 
 sterling was already showing some signs of a lack of confidence in mr. lawson 's promise friday 
 in european trading it declined to $ N and N marks from $ N and N marks late thursday 
 economists suggested that if the pound falls much below N marks the government will be forced to increase rates to N N both to halt any further decline and ensure that the balance of monetary policy remains unchanged

 freight rates declining for most of the decade because of competition spurred by deregulation are <unk> out turning upward and threatening to fuel inflation 
 trucking shipping and air-freight companies have announced rate increases scheduled for this fall or early next year reflecting higher costs and tightened demand for freight transport 
 major shippers say they expect freight rates to rise at least as fast as inflation and maybe faster in the next few years 
 that 's a big change from recent years when freight <unk> was a bright spot for u.s. productivity helping to restrain inflation and make u.s. industry more competitive abroad 
 demand has caught up with the supply of certain types of freight transportation and rates are starting to move up at a rate close to or slightly more than the inflation rate said clifford <unk> director of <unk> at du pont co 
 shippers surveyed recently by ohio state university said they expect their <unk> storage and distribution costs to rise about N N this year 
 only N N of the N shippers polled expected their <unk> costs to decrease compared with N N who had looked to freight transport to reduce costs in past years 
 this is the first year since transportation deregulation in N that we have had such a dramatic and broad-based <unk> in perceived transportation rates said bernard <unk> a transportation <unk> professor at ohio state in columbus 
 the deregulation of <unk> and trucking companies that began in N enabled shippers to bargain for transportation 
 carriers could use their equipment more efficiently leading to overcapacity they were eager to fill 
 shippers cut about $ N billion from their annual <unk> truck and rail costs to about $ N billion or about N N of gross national product down from N N of gnp in N 
 but with much of the <unk> squeezed out of the <unk> system rising costs are likely to be reflected directly in higher freight rates 
 shippers are saying the party 's over said mr. <unk> 
 shippers wo n't be able to look for <unk> savings as they have for the last eight or nine years 
 transport rates wo n't be an opportunity for offsetting cost increases in other segments of the economy 
 robert <unk> a consultant at arthur d. little inc. cambridge mass. said we 've gotten all the benefits of deregulation in <unk> reductions 
 now we are starting to see real <unk> increases as carriers replace equipment pay higher fuel costs and pay more for labor 
 you 'll see carriers try to recoup some of the price cutting that occurred previously 
 not everyone believes that the good times are over for shippers 
 there 's still a lot of pressure on rates in both rail and truck said gerard <unk> <unk> in transportation at massachusetts institute of technology 
 <unk> companies which carry the freight of several shippers in each truck <unk> discounted away a N N rate increase implemented last april 
 the carriers were competing fiercely for market share 
 <unk> increases are likely to be <unk> by weakening <unk> levels and keen competition for freight from trucks 
 an official at consolidated <unk> inc. a menlo park calif. <unk> carrier said rate discounting in that industry has begun to stabilize 
 consolidated <unk> plans to raise its rates N N late this year or early next year and at least two competitors have announced similar increases 
 <unk> are trying to send signals that they need to stop the <unk> forget about market share and go for higher rates said michael lloyd an analyst at salomon <unk> 
 and shippers are getting the feeling that they have played one <unk> off against another as much as they can he said 
 air-freight carriers raised their rates for u.s. products going across the pacific to asia by about N N earlier this month 
 and japan air lines said it plans to boost its rates a further N N over the next two years 
 such rate increases will increase the total cost of u.s. products and slow down the rate of increase of u.s. exports said richard <unk> a senior vice president of <unk> air & sea service u.s.a. inc. the u.s. <unk> subsidiary of nippon <unk> <unk> of japan 
 ship companies carrying bulk commodities such as oil grain coal and iron <unk> have been able to increase their rates in the last couple of years 
 some bulk shipping rates have increased N N to N N in the past few months said salomon 's mr. lloyd 
 and ship lines carrying containers are also trying to raise their rates 
 carriers boosted rates more than N N in the north atlantic between the u.s. and europe last september hoping to partly restore rates to earlier levels 
 ship lines operating in the pacific plan to raise rates on containers carrying u.s. exports to asia about N N effective next april

 bob stone <unk> over a letter from his manager putting him on <unk> for <unk> 
 mr. stone thought the discipline was unfair he believed that his manager wanted to get rid of him for personal reasons 
 unable to persuade the manager to change his decision he went to a company court for a hearing 
 at the scheduled time mr. stone entered a conference room in a building near where he worked 
 after the three members of the court introduced themselves the chairman of the panel said go ahead and tell us what happened 
 we may ask questions as you go along or we may wait until the end 
 no lawyers or tape recorders were present 
 the only extra people were a couple of personnel specialists one of whom knew mr. stone 's case <unk> and would help fill in any facts needed to give the court the full picture 
 over a cup of coffee mr. stone told his story 
 he talked about N minutes 
 when he was through the court members asked many questions then the chairman said they would like to hear his manager 's side and talk to witnesses 
 the chairman promised mr. stone a decision within two weeks 
 bob stone is a <unk> name but the incident described is real 
 it happened at northrop corp. in los angeles 
 the court is called the management appeals committee or just mac and it is likely to hear a couple of dozen cases a year 
 alter some details of this example and it could be taking place today at federal express in memphis the defense and <unk> systems divisions of honeywell in minneapolis a general electric plant in columbia md. or a number of other companies 
 these firms are <unk> in a significant new trend in the corporate world the rise of what i call corporate due process 
 although corporate due process is practiced today in few companies perhaps N to N it is one of the fastest developing trends in industry 
 in the coming decade a majority of <unk> companies are likely to adopt it 
 corporate due process appeals to management for a variety of reasons 
 it reduces lawsuits from <unk> employees and <unk> with all that means for reduced legal costs and better public relations 
 it helps to keep out unions 
 it increases employee commitment to the company with all that means for efficiency and quality control 
 what must your management team do to establish corporate due process 
 here are four key steps 
 N make sure you have a strong personnel department 
 it must be able to handle most of the complaints that can not be solved in the <unk> by managers and their subordinates else the company court or <unk> will be <unk> with cases 
 at polaroid the personnel policy planning committee may hear only about N cases a year the rest of the many hundreds of complaints are resolved at earlier stages 
 at <unk> the system board of adjustment <unk> N to N cases a year only a fraction of the complaints brought to personnel specialists 
 at citicorp the problem review board may hear only N or so cases because of personnel 's <unk> in <unk> 
 in a typical year up to N N of the work force goes to personnel specialists with complaints of unfair treatment 
 in a large company that means many hundreds of complaints for personnel to handle 
 N formally or <unk> train all your managers and supervisors in the company 's <unk> approach 
 see that they know company personnel policy <unk> and <unk> for it is the law governing company courts and <unk> 
 coach them in handling complaints so that they can resolve problems immediately 
 in case managers and personnel specialists are unsuccessful and subordinates take their complaints to a company court or <unk> teach managers to accept <unk> as a fact of business life for in a good <unk> system they are bound to happen 
 in the N companies i studied reversal rates range on the average from N N to N N 
 N decide whether you want a panel system or a single <unk> 
 a panel system like that in the bob stone example enjoys such advantages as high credibility and for the <unk> mutual support 
 an <unk> system that is an investigator who acts first as a <unk> and then switches hats and <unk> the facts has such advantages as speed flexibility and maximum privacy 
 international business machines and bank of america are among the companies using the <unk> approach 
 N make your <unk> system visible 
 it wo n't do any good for anybody unless employees know about it 
 most <unk> hesitate to go all out in advertising their <unk> systems for fear of encouraging <unk> and <unk> <unk> to file complaints 
 on the other hand they make sure at a minimum that their systems are described in their employee <unk> and talked up by personnel specialists 
 <unk> <unk> goes further and sometimes features its <unk> procedure in <unk> tv programs 
 naturally one of the best ways to guarantee <unk> for your <unk> system is for top management to support it 
 at ibm the company 's open door system is sometimes the subject of <unk> from the chief executive

 the u.s. is required to notify foreign <unk> if it knows of coup plans likely to endanger their lives government officials said 
 the notification policy was part of a set of guidelines on handling coups outlined in a secret N exchange of letters between the reagan administration and the senate intelligence committee 
 the existence of the guidelines has become known since president bush disclosed them privately to seven republican senators at a white house meeting last monday 
 officials familiar with the meeting said mr. bush cited the policy as an example of the sort of congressional requirements the administration contends contribute to the failure of such covert actions as this month 's <unk> effort to oust panamanian dictator manuel noriega 
 according to the officials mr. bush even read to the senators <unk> from a highly classified letter from the committee to the white house discussing the guidelines 
 they said the president conceded the notification requirement did n't affect his decision to lend only minor support to this month 's panama coup effort 
 no notification was ever considered officials said apparently because the u.s. did n't think the coup <unk> intended to kill mr. noriega but merely sought to <unk> him 
 what 's more both administration and congressional officials hint that the notification requirement is likely to be dropped from the guidelines on coup attempts that are being <unk> by the panel and the white house 
 the <unk> was launched at a meeting between mr. bush and intelligence committee leaders oct. N a few days before the meeting at which the president complained about the rules 
 however the disclosure of the guidelines first reported last night by nbc news is already being interpreted on capitol hill as an unfair effort to pressure congress 
 it has reopened the bitter <unk> between the white house and congress over who is responsible for the failure to oust mr. noriega and more broadly for difficulties in carrying out covert activities abroad 
 a statement issued by the office of the committee chairman sen. david boren d. okla. charged that the disclosure is part of a continuing effort to shift the criticism for the failure of the recent coup attempt in panama 
 the statement added someone has <unk> chosen to <unk> <unk> portions of highly classified <unk> between the two branches of government 
 not only does this come close to a violation of law it violates the trust we have all worked to develop 
 sen. boren said it 's time to stop <unk> and work together to develop a clear and appropriate policy to help the country in the future 
 i 've invited the president to send his suggestions to the committee 
 republican sen. william cohen of maine the panel 's vice chairman said of the disclosure that a text torn out of context is a <unk> and it is unfair for those in the white house who are <unk> to present the evidence in a selective fashion 
 sen. boren said the committee could n't defend itself by making the documents public because that would violate <unk> rules 
 but the chairman and other committee members stressed that the notification guideline was n't imposed on the white house by a <unk> congress 
 instead both congressional and administration officials agreed it grew out of talks about <unk> in panama that were initiated by the administration in july N and stretched into last october 
 the guideline was n't a law but a joint interpretation of how the u.s. might operate during foreign coups in light of the longstanding presidential order banning a u.s. role in assassinations 
 in fact yesterday the administration and congress were still <unk> on what had been agreed to 
 one administration official said notification was required even if the u.s. gets wind of somebody else 's coup plans that seem likely to endanger a dictator 's life 
 but a congressional source close to the panel said the rule only covered coup plans directly involving the u.s. 
 although the notification guideline was n't carried out in this month 's coup attempt some administration officials argue that it may have led to <unk> and uncertainty on the part of u.s. intelligence and military <unk> in panama 
 one senior administration official called the guideline <unk> and said it could make u.s. <unk> reluctant to even listen to coup plans for fear they may get into legal trouble 
 the issue came to a head last year officials recalled partly because the reagan administration had sought unsuccessfully to win committee approval of funding for new panama coup efforts 
 in addition both administration and congressional officials said the need for guidelines on coups and assassinations was partly spurred by a white house desire to avoid nasty overseas surprises during the election campaign 
 though the assassination ban is a white house order that congress never voted on the intelligence committees can exercise influence over its interpretation 
 last week central intelligence agency director william webster publicly called on congress to provide new <unk> of the assassination order that would permit the u.s. more freedom to act in coups 
 the administration has reacted to criticism that it <unk> the latest coup attempt by seeking to blame congress for restrictions the white house said have hampered its freedom of action 
 however last week mr. webster 's two top cia deputies said congressional curbs had n't hampered the spy agency 's role in the coup attempt in panama 
 nevertheless the administration 's criticisms appeared to have made some <unk> with sens. boren and cohen after their oct. N meeting with the president 
 the three men agreed to rewrite the guidelines without changing the basic assassination ban to clear up any <unk> that may have hampered u.s. encouragement of coups against <unk> leaders 
 the new argument over the notification guideline however could sour any atmosphere of cooperation that existed

 yet under its 45-year-old president trelleborg moved aggressively into those <unk> base industries first strengthening its existing rubber and plastics division later adding mining as well as building and construction materials 
 it was a <unk> move for a <unk> executive fired after only two months as president of his previous company

 trelleborg 's internationally traded <unk> series stock plunged <unk> $ N to <unk> $ N in volatile trading monday in stockholm 
 tuesday the shares regained <unk> closing at <unk> 
 mr. andersson says he is confident that taking parts of the company public will help <unk> the conglomerate <unk> that has held down trelleborg 's share price 
 trelleborg plans to remain the dominant shareholder with stakes of slightly less than N N of both units 
 the spinoff should solve a problem for the parent 
 a family foundation set up by late founder henry <unk> controls N N of trelleborg 's voting shares outstanding 
 but the foundation <unk> require the entire trelleborg stake to be sold in the open market if control drops below N N 
 that possibility had <unk> closer as repeated new share offerings to finance trelleborg 's rapid growth steadily diluted the foundation 's holding 
 that growth is the result of mr. andersson 's shopping spree during which he has bought and sold more than N companies during the past five years 
 most of the new additions were barely profitable if not outright loss makers 
 applying <unk> gained during earlier <unk> at <unk> maker ab <unk> mr. andersson and a handful of loyal <unk> aggressively stripped away dead wood and got quick results 
 the treatment turned trelleborg into one of <unk> 's biggest and fastest-growing industrial concerns 
 between N and N sales <unk> more than N times and pretax profit surged almost <unk> 
 many analysts expect mr. andersson who owns N N of the company to be named trelleborg 's new chairman when ernst <unk> steps down next year 
 but the promotion is n't likely to alter a management style mr. andersson describes as being the driving force leading the troops not managing by sitting back with a <unk> waiting for people to bring me ideas 
 last month in his <unk> move yet mr. andersson and trelleborg joined forces with canada 's noranda inc. in a joint $ N billion hostile takeover of another big canadian mining concern falconbridge ltd 
 industry analysts suggest that the <unk> of falconbridge could vault trelleborg from a regional <unk> success story to a <unk> mining concern 
 trelleborg is n't in the same league yet as mining giants such as <unk> corp. or <unk> corp. says mike <unk> a mining analyst at james capel & co. london 
 but we certainly like what we 've seen so far 
 but trelleborg still must clear some tough hurdles 
 mr. andersson acknowledges that the company 's mining division will be busy for a while <unk> its recent expansion 
 booming metals prices have fueled trelleborg 's recent profit surge raising mining 's share of pretax profit to N N this year from a big loss two years earlier 
 but analysts caution an expected fall in metal prices next year could slow profit growth 
 mining is likely to remain trelleborg 's main business 
 analysts say its chances of success will likely <unk> on how well trelleborg manages to cooperate with noranda in the falconbridge venture 
 noranda and trelleborg each came close to winning falconbridge alone before the successful joint bid 
 some analysts say noranda would prefer to break up falconbridge and that the <unk> relatively <unk> in international mining operations could have problems holding their own with a much bigger partner like noranda operating on its home turf 
 mr. andersson insists that trelleborg and noranda have n't discussed a falconbridge <unk> 
 falconbridge he says will continue operating in its current form 
 we 'd be reluctant to accept N ownership in a manufacturing company 
 but such partnerships are common in mining where there are n't problems or conflict of interest or risk of cheating by a partner trelleborg 's president says 
 perhaps more important both companies share mr. andersson 's belief in the coming renaissance of base industries 
 if the 1980s were a decade of consumption the <unk> will be the investment decade mr. andersson says 
 the whole of europe and the industrialized world is suffering from a breakdown in infrastructure investment he says 
 that 's beginning to change 
 and investment is the key word for base metals and most other businesses trelleborg is in

 <unk> ortiz 's sept. N <unk> column mexico 's been <unk> by the privatization <unk> is a <unk> clear statement of his government 's commitment to privatization and must be welcomed as such by all americans who wish his country well 
 the <unk> states institute is glad to see such a high official as mexico 's undersecretary of finance view his country 's reforms in the context of a larger world-wide process of <unk> change toward free-market economics especially in the <unk> countries 
 having said that we must caution against an apparent tendency to <unk> the case 
 it is not quite true for example that the mexican government has privatized <unk> de <unk> as mr. ortiz claims 
 in the same sentence he <unk> himself when he reports that the government still retains N N of the total equity of the airline 
 how can a company be considered privatized if the state is so heavily represented in it 
 true the mexican government has granted control over the airline to a new private consortium but its <unk> to take back what it gives is too well known to permit one to be <unk> 
 <unk> too mr. ortiz resorts to the familiar numbers game when he boasts that fewer than N state enterprises currently remain in the public sector down from the N public entities that existed in N 
 but the enterprises still in state hands include the biggest and most economically powerful ones in mexico indeed they virtually constitute the economic infrastructure 
 i refer essentially to petroleum electric power banking and newsprint 
 those enterprises however are not going to be privatized 
 they are officially considered strategic and their privatization is prohibited by the mexican constitution 
 in language that <unk> the issue mr. ortiz writes the divestiture of <unk> and <unk> public enterprises is an essential element of president carlos salinas 's plan to modernize mexico 's economy 
 yet clearly modernization must <unk> its key industries before it can be said to have caught the privatization <unk>

 a labor-management group is preparing a revised buy-out bid for united airlines parent ual corp. that would transfer majority ownership to employees while leaving some stock in public hands according to people familiar with the group 
 the group has been discussing a proposal valued in a range of $ N to $ N a share or $ N billion to $ N billion 
 but to avoid the risk of rejection the group does n't plan to submit the plan formally at a ual board meeting today 
 instead the group is raising the proposal <unk> to try to test the board 's reaction 
 people familiar with the company say the board is n't likely to give quick approval to any offer substantially below the $ 300-a-share $ N billion buy-out bid that collapsed last week after banks would n't raise needed loans and after a key partner british airways plc dropped out 
 in composite trading friday on the new york stock exchange ual closed at $ N a share down $ N 
 but the pilots union which has been pushing for a takeover since N appears to be pressing ahead with the revised bid to avoid further loss of momentum even though it has n't found a partner to replace british air 
 although the bidding group has n't had time to develop its latest idea fully or to discuss it with banks it believes bank financing could be obtained 
 after the collapse of the last effort the group does n't plan to make any formal proposal without <unk> commitments from banks covering the entire amount to be borrowed 
 under the type of transaction being discussed the <unk> group would borrow several billion dollars from banks that could then be used to finance a cash payment to current holders 
 those current holders would also receive minority interests in the new company 
 for example the group could offer $ N a share in cash plus stock valued at $ N a share 
 ual currently has N million shares fully diluted 
 the new structure would be similar to a recapitalization in which holders get a special dividend yet retain a controlling ownership interest 
 the difference is that current holders would n't retain majority ownership or control 
 the failed takeover would have given ual employees N N voting control of the nation 's second-largest airline with management getting N N control and british air N N 
 it was n't clear how the ownership would <unk> up under the new plan but employees would keep more than N N 
 management 's total could be reduced and the public could get more than the N N control that had been earmarked for british air 
 one option the board is likely to consider today is some sort of <unk> period 
 although the pilots are expected to continue to pursue the bid ual chairman stephen wolf may be asked to withdraw from the buy-out effort at least temporarily and to return to running the company full time 
 the board could eventually come under some pressure to sell the company because its members can be ousted by a majority shareholder vote particularly since one-third of ual stock is held by takeover stock speculators who favor a sale 
 the labor-management buy-out group plans to keep its offer on the table in an apparent attempt to maintain its bargaining position with the board 
 however the only outsider who has emerged to lead such a shareholder vote los angeles investor marvin davis who triggered the buy-out with a $ N billion bid in early august is hanging back apparently to avoid being blamed for contributing to the deal 's collapse 
 three top advisers to mr. davis visited new york late last week at least in part to <unk> with executives at citicorp 
 mr. davis had paid $ N million for citicorp 's backing of his last bid 
 but citicorp has lost some credibility because it also led the unsuccessful effort to gain bank loans for the labor-management group 
 on friday british air issued a statement saying it does not intend to participate in any new deal for the acquisition of ual in the foreseeable future 
 however several people said that british air might yet <unk> the bidding group and that the carrier made the statement to answer questions from british regulators about how it plans to use proceeds of a securities offering previously earmarked for the ual buy-out 
 also late last week ual flight attendants agreed to participate with the pilots in <unk> a revised offer 
 but the machinists union whose opposition helped scuttle the first buy-out bid is likely to favor a recapitalization with a friendly <unk> investor 
 one advantage the buy-out group intends to press with the board is that pilots have agreed to make $ N million in annual cost concessions to help finance a bid 
 speculation has also <unk> that the ual executive most closely identified with the failure to gain bank financing chief financial officer john pope may come under pressure to resign 
 however people familiar with the buy-out group said mr. pope 's departure would weaken the airline 's management at a critical time 
 despite the buy-out group 's failure to obtain financing ual remains obligated to pay $ N million in investment banking and legal fees to the group 's advisers lazard <unk> & co. salomon brothers inc. and paul weiss <unk> <unk> & garrison

 in east germany where humor has long been the only way to express political criticism they 're not laughing about their new leader egon krenz 
 mr. krenz is such a <unk> figure that nobody has even come up with any good jokes about him 
 you have to have clear feelings about someone before you can make jokes says an east german mother of two who <unk> <unk> political <unk> with her friends 
 with krenz we just do n't know what to expect 
 mr. krenz does n't seem to be the <unk> <unk> many initially thought he was when the <unk> politburo member was selected last week to succeed erich honecker 
 but he does n't appear to be ready to make broad changes either 
 according to east germany 's <unk> news agency mr. krenz spoke to soviet leader mikhail gorbachev by telephone over the weekend and acknowledged east germany could learn from moscow 's glasnost policies 
 already last week mr. krenz started <unk> east germany 's heavily <unk> and <unk> boring news media 
 on thursday a day after he took office east german television broke into regular programming to launch a talk show in which viewers call in questions for a panel of officials to answer 
 the regular <unk> news program and daily newspapers are also getting a visible injection of <unk> glasnost 
 it was quite a shock says a <unk> east german <unk> 
 for the first time in my life i was n't sure whether i was listening to our news or west german television 
 other changes including easing restrictions on travel for east germans are expected 
 but whether such moves can win back the confidence of east germans who have taken to the streets by the thousands in recent weeks to demand democratic changes depends largely on whether they feel they can trust mr. krenz 
 and that 's a problem 
 mr. krenz is not only closely identified with his <unk> mr. honecker but also blamed for ordering violent police action against protesters this month and for <unk> china for sending tanks against student demonstrators 
 i hope he grows with the job says <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> in east berlin 
 the most important thing is that he have a chance 
 although mr. krenz is dedicated to east germany 's conservative <unk> of communism there is much about his style that sets him apart from his party <unk> 
 unlike mr. honecker who <unk> to <unk> people about socialist values mr. krenz enjoys asking questions 
 indeed one of his first actions as leader was to visit a <unk> machine factory on the <unk> of berlin and <unk> among the workers a la gorbachev 
 he was later shown on television <unk> questions 
 at one point he asked a worker whether he thought east germans were <unk> the country because of restrictive travel policies 
 the worker 's <unk> <unk> it 's more than just travel 
 people have a sense the government is ignoring the real problems in our society 
 the exchange was all the more remarkable in that authorities released television <unk> to western news agencies 
 this same tendency toward openness impressed a group of visiting u.s. congressmen this spring 
 rather than trying to <unk> us says one congressional aide who attended the <unk> meeting mr. krenz wanted to listen 
 rep. <unk> <unk> d. ala. one of the members of the delegation says he was particularly impressed by mr. krenz 's ready admission that east germany needed to change 
 he 's a very tough man but one who 's also open to arguments adds an aide to west german chancellor helmut kohl 
 but there 's another side to mr. krenz 
 born in a <unk> town in an area which is now part of poland he has dedicated his life to the party <unk> 
 he moved quickly through the ranks with the help of his <unk> mr. honecker and emerged as the heir apparent 
 barbara <unk> an expert on east germany at radio free europe in <unk> says mr. krenz may project a smooth image but she doubts he 's a true <unk>
