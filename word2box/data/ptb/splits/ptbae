 <unk> merck 's new <unk> drug had higher sales than any other prescription medicine has ever achieved in the u.s. in the year following introduction the company said

 lilly attributed record third-quarter and nine-month results to world-wide gains for pharmaceuticals medical instruments and <unk> products despite poor exchange rates for the dollar that slowed sales abroad

 that compares with per-share earnings from continuing operations of N cents the year earlier including discontinued operations per-share was N cents a year ago 
 the per-share estimates mean the consumer-products company 's net income increased to between $ N million and $ N million from $ N million the <unk> period 
 analysts estimate colgate 's world-wide third-quarter sales rose about N N to $ N billion 
 mr. mark attributed the earnings growth to strong sales in latin america asia and europe 
 results were also bolstered by a very meaningful increase in operating profit by colgate 's u.s. business mr. mark said 
 operating profit at colgate 's u.s. household products and <unk> businesses jumped N N in the quarter mr. mark added 
 he said the improvement was a result of cost savings achieved by consolidating manufacturing operations <unk> two sales organizations and focusing more carefully the company 's promotional activities 
 the estimated improvement in colgate 's u.s. operations took some analysts by surprise 
 colgate 's household products business which includes such brands as <unk> <unk> detergent and <unk> <unk> has been a weak performer 
 analysts estimate colgate 's sales of household products in the u.s. were flat for the quarter and they estimated operating margins at only N N to N N 
 if you could say their business in the u.s. was <unk> but great everywhere else that would be fine says <unk> austin an analyst with wertheim schroder & co 
 but it 's not <unk> it 's a real problem 
 mr. mark conceded that colgate 's domestic business apart from its highly profitable hill 's pet products unit has lagged 
 we 've done a lot to improve u.s. results and a lot more will be done mr. mark said

 deeply <unk> in both the book review <unk> nature <unk> by stephen macdonald leisure & arts sept. N and the books reviewed is the assumption that global warming is entirely a result of human activity 
 is such a view justified 
 in the absence of humans would the earth enjoy a constant climate over the long term 
 clearly not 
 about N years ago the last ice age ended 
 enormous ice sheets retreated from the face of north america northern europe and asia 
 this global warming must have been entirely natural nobody would blame it on a few hundred thousand <unk> hunting <unk> and <unk> around in <unk> 
 furthermore no bell has yet <unk> to announce the end of this <unk> episode of natural global warming 
 it is probably continuing and may well account for most of or all of <unk> global warming 
 i <unk> to no one in my regard for our <unk> heritage but if we are serious about global warming we must look at the big picture and not allow the dominant culture to lock us into the <unk> warming scenario as the sole model for discussion 
 <unk> <unk> <unk> department university of 
 the internal revenue service plans to restructure itself more like a private corporation 
 in addition the <unk> agency says that it will take the unusual step of looking to the private sector to fill two new <unk> positions to guide the <unk> agency a comptroller to oversee daily finances and a chief information officer to update the information system which includes probably the largest computer data base in the world 
 the irs also said that it would create the position of chief financial officer who will be hired from within the agency 
 irs commissioner fred t. goldberg said the changes are intended to bring accountability to the agency which has an annual budget of more than $ N billion and <unk> about $ N trillion a year 
 my assessment and everyone 's assessment is that we do not have the kinds of information that let us <unk> and effectively <unk> and execute our budget mr. goldberg said 
 and we do n't have internal controls and discipline that we need to have to spend $ N billion properly 
 mr. goldberg who took over as head of the irs in july has been <unk> by what he considers the <unk> waste and lack of coordination among the branches of the vast federal agency 
 the irs operates on a computer system designed in N which it has been trying to modernize for years 
 and the agency which operated throughout fiscal N with a $ N million budget <unk> has been under a hiring freeze since last fall 
 the new commissioner says that closer scrutiny of how the agency uses its resources will go a long way toward <unk> its ability to collect more tax revenue 
 i think that you will see a significant improvement in the budget <unk> and execution process which in turn i believe will result in a significant increase in revenue he said 
 the irs hopes to fill the new positions soon 
 <unk> it would <unk> career civil <unk> from within the agency but mr. goldberg said he plans to <unk> the world for the chief information officer and the comptroller 
 although the jobs will probably pay between $ N and $ N a year irs officials are confident that they can attract <unk> candidates from the private sector 
 you 're telling someone they can spend the next three or four or five or six years of their life bringing about the most difficult and costly modernization of an information system on the civil side ever mr. goldberg said 
 on the comptroller side you 're developing and making work financial controls governing a $ N billion budget 
 when <unk> <unk> <unk> the leader of the <unk> coup in panama was buried his body <unk> several <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> and broken <unk> and <unk> 
 they were the signature of his adversary panamanian leader manuel antonio noriega 
 the rebel officer 's slow and painful death at the headquarters of panama 's <unk> <unk> was personally <unk> by gen. noriega says a u.s. official with access to intelligence reports 
 leaping into <unk> sinking into <unk> of <unk> and <unk> mr. noriega has put to death some N of his troops involved in the coup according to u.s. officials monitoring <unk> and <unk> <unk> in panama city 
 he is now changing the place he <unk> every night sometimes more than once a night 
 his meals are most often prepared by women he trusts his full-time <unk> <unk> <unk> and her mother <unk> 
 and he is collecting the names of those who <unk> the <unk> to <unk> them during their brief time in control of his headquarters 
 more enemies to be dealt with 
 in the two weeks since the <unk> which the u.s. <unk> backed mr. noriega has been at his most <unk> and efficient in maintaining power 
 yet while the failed coup is a major u.s. foreign policy embarrassment it is merely the latest chapter in a <unk> relationship between mr. noriega and washington that <unk> back three decades 
 america 's war on the dictator over the past two years following his indictment on drug charges in february N is the <unk> of that relationship 
 before american foreign policy set out to destroy noriega it helped create him out of the <unk> of panama 's long history of <unk> and <unk> 
 for most of the past N years the marriage was one of convenience 
 in N for example when mr. noriega was both a <unk> at an elite military academy in peru and a <unk> for the u.s. defense intelligence agency he was <unk> by <unk> authorities for allegedly <unk> and <unk> beating a <unk> according to a u.s. embassy cable from that period 
 the woman had nearly died 
 but u.s. intelligence rather than rein in or cut loose its new spy merely filed the report away 
 mr. noriega 's tips on emerging <unk> at his school were deemed more important to u.s. interests 
 from that point on the u.s. would make a practice of <unk> the panamanian 's <unk> 
 the u.s. has <unk> and later turned against many <unk> but none quite so <unk> 
 the <unk> mr. noriega is n't as smooth as the shah of iran as <unk> as nicaragua 's <unk> <unk> as imperial as ferdinand marcos of the philippines or as bloody as <unk> 's baby <unk> <unk> 
 yet he has proved more <unk> than any of them 
 and out of necessity the u.s. can make mistakes and still hope to remove him from power but a single error on his part could cost him his life 
 the u.s. underestimated noriega all along says <unk> moss a former ambassador to panama 
 he has <unk> the art of survival 
 in keeping with america 's long history of <unk> up mr. noriega recent u.s. actions have extended rather than <unk> his survival 
 mr. noriega might have fallen of his own weight in N because of panama 's dire economic situation says mr. moss but increasing external pressure has only given him additional <unk> for repression and a <unk> for his own <unk> 
 if the u.s. had sat back and done nothing he might not have made it through N mr. moss contends 
 perhaps most important mr. noriega 's allies have intervened to encourage in some cases to demand that the dictator maintain his grip of the <unk> 
 one colombian drug boss upon hearing in N that gen. noriega was negotiating with the u.s. to abandon his command for a comfortable <unk> sent him a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with his name 
 he is <unk> says the rev. fernando <unk> who has led catholic church opposition against noriega 
 the americans have left him without a way out 
 it is easy to fight when you do n't have any other option 
 his chief advantage in the fight his intimate knowledge of american ways and weaknesses 
 mr. noriega often tells friends that patience is the best weapon against the <unk> who have a short attention span and little <unk> for lasting confrontation 
 the u.s. discovered the young tony noriega in late N when he was in his second year at the <unk> military academy in <unk> according to former u.s. intelligence officials 
 the contact occurred through mr. noriega 's <unk> a panamanian diplomat based in peru named luis carlos noriega <unk> 
 luis carlos knowing that helping the americans could advance the career of any panamanian officer <unk> tony 's reports on the leftist <unk> he observed among his fellow students and more important among his officers and <unk> 
 a spy was born 
 it was a <unk> experience for the <unk> and slightly built mr. noriega who was known to his friends as cara la <unk> <unk> face 
 born the <unk> son of his father 's <unk> he was raised on the mean streets of the central market district of panama city 
 tony was four years older than most of his fellow <unk> and gained admission to the academy because his brother had <unk> his birth certificate 
 he considered himself <unk> superior to his <unk> <unk> many of whom were <unk> sons sent by their <unk> families to the highly disciplined <unk> academy as a sort of reform school 
 in his peaked military cap and neatly pressed <unk> uniform noriega felt more respected and powerful than ever in his <unk> life friends from the period say 
 he had an elegant uniform with gold <unk> in a country where there was a <unk> of <unk> where officers were the elite with special privileges recalls <unk> <unk> a fellow student in peru and a <unk> friend 
 mr. noriega 's relationship to american intelligence agencies became <unk> in either N or N intelligence officials say 
 his commanding officer at the <unk> province garrison major <unk> torrijos gave him an intriguing <unk> mr. noriega would <unk> the province 's first intelligence service 
 the spy network would serve two clients the panamanian government by monitoring political opponents in the region and the u.s. by tracking the growing communist influence in the unions organized at united fruit co. 's <unk> <unk> in <unk> del <unk> and puerto <unk> 
 united fruit was one of the two largest <unk> to panama 's national income 
 satisfying its interests was a priority for any panamanian leader 
 mr. noriega 's initial <unk> was only $ N to $ N a month plus <unk> gifts of liquor or <unk> from the american <unk> a former intelligence official says 
 it was modest pay by american standards but a healthy boost to his small military salary which fellow officers remember as having been $ N to $ N monthly 
 he did it very well recalls <unk> <unk> a former panamanian <unk> who managed mr. noriega and his operation 
 he started building the files that helped him gain power 
 a national guard job assumed by <unk> noriega in N as chief of the transit police in david city capital of the <unk> province was <unk> for an <unk> <unk> 
 by <unk> taxi and bus drivers who needed licenses he gained a ready <unk> of information 
 he knew which local <unk> had been caught driving drunk which had been found with their <unk> 
 this proved particularly valuable to the panamanian government in N when union leaders were planning a may day march that the government feared could turn violent 
 mr. noriega had learned that a local union leader was sleeping with the wife of his deputy 
 so he <unk> the information on <unk> that he distributed throughout the <unk> city of puerto <unk> which was ruled by united fruit co 
 the campaign so divided union leaders that the government found them far easier to control 
 it was like a play on broadway recalls mr. <unk> 
 noriega managed the whole thing 
 he was <unk> 
 noriega was an expert at <unk> and <unk> people 
 during his years in <unk> however mr. noriega also revealed himself as an officer as <unk> as he was <unk> 
 <unk> <unk> a local lawyer and human-rights monitor recalls an <unk> noriega visiting <unk> in their cells at the <unk> zone garrison headquarters in david where he had his offices 
 mr. noriega would order them all to take off their clothes and run around the <unk> naked laughing at them and then retreating to his office 
 people started wondering if something was wrong with him mr. <unk> recalls 
 but through this period so far as the u.s. military was concerned mr. noriega was a model recruit 
 he signed up for intelligence and <unk> training under american officers at fort <unk> in panama in july N according to a copy of a N resume with details mr. noriega has since classified as secret 
 he flew to fort <unk> n.c. in september of that year for a course in psychological operations returning to the school of the <unk> in panama for a <unk> course called military intelligence for officers 
 some american officers interpreted his eagerness and <unk> as a sign of loyalty but they did so <unk> 
 he rose to chief of intelligence in panama 's <unk> <unk> in N after providing <unk> dictator torrijos the critical support to defeat a coup attempt against him a year earlier 
 he became gen. torrijos 's <unk> shadow and the holder of all panama 's secrets 
 mr. noriega by now a <unk> <unk> expanded his contacts to include the cubans not to mention the <unk> the taiwanese and any other intelligence service that came knocking 
 when u.s. diplomats complained to the cia of col. noriega 's <unk> intelligence experts always insisted that his <unk> was first to the americans 
 early on in the state department we took to calling him the <unk> in <unk> to his ability to simultaneously milk the <unk> intelligence services of cuba and the united states recalls francis j. <unk> who as deputy assistant secretary of state for <unk> affairs first ran across reports about mr. noriega in N 
 some of us <unk> how our intelligence people could put so much stock in his information when he was just as close to the cubans 
 even at this early stage drugs caused additional concerns 
 during the nixon administration the drug enforcement administration became <unk> at the extent of the <unk> 's connections to arrested drug traffickers 
 one <unk> agent drew up a list of five options for dealing with col. noriega one of which was assassination 
 the head of the <unk> at the time john ingersoll <unk> the assassination plan 
 but he did fly to panama to <unk> dictator torrijos on the drug ties of panamanian officials including mr. noriega 
 mr. ingersoll later recalled that gen. torrijos seemed afraid to act on the concerns of the u.s. 
 everybody was afraid of him mr. ingersoll says 
 mr. noriega became an even greater threat in N when u.s. intelligence services discovered that he had been buying <unk> of electronically monitored conversations from three <unk> working for the u.s. army 's <unk> military intelligence group 
 the tapes included <unk> of gen. torrijos 's own phone according to american intelligence officials 
 we caught him with his hands on our <unk> <unk> says former cia director <unk> turner 
 for the first time the u.s. considered cutting mr. noriega from its intelligence payroll and the deliberations were intense mr. turner says 
 in the world of intelligence if you want to get information you get it from <unk> characters 
 the question is how much you get tied in with <unk> characters so they can <unk> you 
 intelligence officials to this day worry whether mr. noriega sold sensitive information on the <unk> to the cubans or others 
 mr. turner was troubled enough to cancel the u.s. contract with the <unk> at the beginning of the carter administration 
 the u.s. soon found new cause for concern <unk> 
 prosecutors in southern florida indicted five <unk> on charges of illegally running arms to sandinista rebels trying to <unk> the nicaraguan government of mr. <unk> 
 they included one of mr. noriega 's <unk> friends and business partners carlos <unk> 
 and the investigators were quickly closing in on mr. noriega himself 
 at the time though in N the u.s. was once again <unk> with its longtime latin american spy 
 mr. noriega made plans to fly to washington for a meeting with his counterpart at the pentagon 
 <unk> county and federal authorities learning that he intended to fly through miami made plans to arrest him on the <unk> charges as soon as he hit u.s. soil 
 it was a friday in june 
 the pentagon <unk> the plan 
 according to military officers at the time word was passed to mr. noriega by his american hosts that the police would be waiting 
 on monday u.s. officials received a routine <unk> message from the military group <unk> in panama 
 due to health reasons <unk> col. noriega has elected to postpone his visit to washington it read 
 prosecutors in miami received yet another setback 
 their original indictment against mr. <unk> the friend of mr. noriega and the other four was dismissed on a <unk> 
 but now along with <unk> mr. noriega 's <unk> they intended to charge mr. noriega himself on allegations that he was involved in the illegal trading of some $ N million in arms 
 in january N jerome sanford as assistant u.s. attorney was summoned to a meeting with a federal bureau of investigation agent assigned to the bureau of alcohol tobacco and <unk> in miami 
 panamanian dictator torrijos he was told had granted the shah of iran <unk> in panama as a favor to washington 
 mr. sanford was told mr. noriega 's friend mr. <unk> would be handling the shah 's security 
 it would n't be a good idea to <unk> him much less mr. noriega the prosecutor was told 
 after <unk> from mr. sanford u.s. attorney jack <unk> pleaded with justice department officials in washington to let the indictment proceed 
 unfortunately mr. <unk> wrote in a letter those of us in law enforcement in miami find ourselves frequently attempting to enforce the laws of the united states but simultaneously being caught between foreign policy considerations over which we have no control 
 the letter along with a detailed prosecution memo sat on the desks of justice officials for months before the case died a quiet death 
 i think if we had been allowed to go ahead then we would n't have the problems we have now mr. sanford says 
 if he had been found guilty we could have stopped him 
 in august N mr. noriega took over as general and <unk> dictator of panama having <unk> his way to the top only two years after the <unk> death in a plane crash of his old boss <unk> torrijos 
 soon the military became a <unk> mafia controlling legal and illegal businesses 
 the reagan administration also put mr. noriega 's <unk> back on the u.s. payroll 
 payments averaged nearly $ N a year from the u.s. defense intelligence agency and the cia 
 although working for u.s. intelligence mr. noriega was hardly helping the u.s. exclusively 
 during the reagan years he expanded his business and intelligence contacts with the cubans and the sandinistas 
 he allegedly entered into panama 's first formal business arrangement with colombian drug bosses according to <unk> <unk> a pilot who once worked for mr. noriega and who testified before the u.s. grand jury in miami that would ultimately <unk> the panamanian on drug charges 
 but mr. noriega was convinced the reagan white house would n't act against him recalls his close ally jose <unk> because he had an insurance policy his involvement with the contra rebels in nicaragua 
 mr. <unk> says the general allowed the contras to set up a secret training center in panama 
 mr. noriega also <unk> intelligence from his spy operation inside the nicaraguan capital of managua 
 and on at least one occasion in the spring of N he helped arrange a sabotage attack on a sandinista <unk> in nicaragua 
 although his help for the contra cause was limited it was enough to win him important <unk> in the reagan administration says sen. patrick <unk> a vermont democrat who then served on the senate intelligence committee 
 noriega played u.s. intelligence agencies and the u.s. government like a violin he says 
 an incident in N suggested one additional means by which mr. noriega might have maintained such influence with washington by <unk> u.s. officials 
 <unk> windsor then the ambassador to costa rica recalls being invited to panama by mr. noriega 's brother luis carlos for a weekend of deep sea fishing and quiet serious conversation on the <unk> peninsula 
 mr. windsor notified <unk> e. briggs the u.s. ambassador to panama of the invitation 
 briggs <unk> mr. windsor recalls 
 he says mr. briggs told him he was being set up for a <unk> trap in which mr. noriega would try to involve him in an <unk> and then record the event with sound and video 
 mr. briggs on vacation after resigning his position at the national security council could n't be reached for comment 
 as mr. noriega 's political troubles grew so did his offers of assistance to the contras an apparent attempt to curry more favor in washington 
 for instance he helped steal the may N panamanian elections for the ruling party 
 but just one month later he also contributed $ N to a contra leader according to documents released for oliver north 's criminal trial in washington <unk> 
 yet his political setbacks mounted 
 mr. noriega was accused of ordering in N the <unk> of hugo <unk> his most outspoken political opponent and the first man to publicly finger mr. noriega on drug trafficking charges 
 he then ousted president nicholas <unk> <unk> a former world bank official with close ties to the u.s. after mr. <unk> tried to create a commission to investigate the murder 
 and all the while panama 's debt problems continued to grow 
 mr. noriega was growing desperate 
 in late N he made an offer he thought the u.s. could n't refuse 
 as <unk> in a <unk> that <unk> government documents released for the north trial mr. noriega offered to <unk> the sandinista leadership in exchange for a promise to help clean up noriega 's image and a commitment to lift the u.s. ban on military sales to the panamanian defense forces 
 north the document went on referring to oliver north has told noriega 's representative that u.s. law <unk> such actions 
 the representative responded that noriega had numerous assets in place in nicaragua and could accomplish many essential things just as noriega had helped the u.s. the previous year in <unk> up a sandinista <unk> 
 col. north <unk> the request to his <unk> and to assistant secretary of state <unk> abrams who <unk> it to secretary of state george <unk> 
 mr. noriega 's proposal was turned down 
 and mr. <unk> <unk> told mr. abrams that the general should be told that only he could repair his <unk> image 
 the end of the marriage was at hand 
 within weeks the <unk> iran-contra scandal took away mr. noriega 's insurance policy 
 the death of cia director william <unk> and resignation of oliver north allowed <unk> political forces to gain influence 
 public protests against him were triggered in june N due to charges by <unk> <unk> his former chief of staff that mr. noriega had stolen the N election and had ordered the killing of messrs. <unk> and torrijos 
 few american officials were willing any longer to defend him 
 lawyers in miami this time working virtually without <unk> prepared to have him indicted on drug charges in february N 
 during negotiations with american officials in may N over proposals to drop the u.s. <unk> in exchange for his resignation mr. noriega often asked almost <unk> how the americans whom he had helped for so many years could turn against him 
 now neither side the u.s. nor mr. noriega has an easy out 
 president bush has sworn to bring him to justice 
 mr. noriega believes he has n't any alternative but to continue <unk> to power 
 it is a <unk> battle perhaps to the death 
 in the end is mr. noriega the political equivalent of <unk> 's monster created by a <unk> but <unk> foreign power 
 not quite sen. <unk> contends 
 for short-term gains people were willing to put up with him 
 that allowed him to get stronger and stronger he says 
 i do n't think we created him as much as we fed him <unk> him and let him grow up to be big and strong

 yesterday 's edition provided analysts ' estimates for the company when actual earnings were available 
 industrial production declined N N in september reinforcing other signs that the manufacturing sector continues its slowing trend 
 the federal reserve board said output of the nation 's factories mines and utilities expanded at an annual rate of N N in the third quarter substantially slower than the N N annual rate in the second quarter 
 capital spending and exports which have been the driving force in this expansion are showing clear signs of having the steam taken out of them said robert <unk> economist for northern trust co. in chicago 
 the new reports of <unk> which were <unk> by an earlier labor department report that manufacturing <unk> dropped by N in september give the fed another reason to further ease its grip on credit and lower interest rates 
 they need to do something about this said <unk> harris economist at painewebber group inc 
 the fed also said u.s. industry operated at N N of capacity last month down from N N in august 
 measures of manufacturing activity fell more than the overall measures 
 factory output dropped N N its first decline since february after having been unchanged in october 
 factories operated at N N of capacity the lowest rate in more than a year and down from N N in september 
 the declines mainly reflected widespread weakness in durable goods those intended to last more than three years 
 the biggest drop was recorded by primary metals producers a category that includes the steel industry 
 output of business equipment was unchanged in september 
 production of factory equipment one indication of the strength of manufacturers ' investment spending fell N N 
 some economists expect further declines in investment spending 
 whenever corporate profits are weak that means capital spending is going to soften subsequently mr. harris said 
 you have n't seen the full effect of that yet 
 a decline in truck production more than offset a sharp rise in auto <unk> the fed noted

 lung-cancer mortality rates for people under N years of age have begun to decline federal researchers report 
 the drop is particularly large for white males although black males and white and black women also show lower mortality rates 
 a report in this week 's issue of the journal of the national cancer institute also projects that overall u.s. mortality rates from lung cancer the leading cause of cancer death should begin to drop in several years if cigarette smoking continues to <unk> 
 the report which comes N years after the u.s. surgeon general issued a report warning against the dangers of smoking is the strongest indication to date that the reduction in smoking is leading to lower death rates from lung cancer 
 what this is saying is that the surgeon general 's message is having an impact said <unk> <unk> an <unk> at the johns hopkins school of <unk> and public health in baltimore 
 the national cancer institute report compares mortality rates of two groups of people between the ages of N and N a decade apart 
 the death rate from lung cancer of white males aged N to N in the mid-1970s was N per N but the mortality rate of the same age group in the mid-1980s was N a decline of N N 
 measured the same way the decline for black males was N N 
 the drop in mortality rates for women was less steep N N for blacks and N N for whites 
 the study by susan <unk> william <unk> and joseph <unk> of the institute 's staff also shows that the <unk> of lung cancer as well as the death rate declined over the decade for all groups in the N age <unk> except black men 
 although lung-cancer mortality rates are increasing for the nation as a whole the report projects that death rates will begin to decline in the 1990s for men and after the year N for women 
 lung-cancer mortality rates increase with age and are continuing to rise for all age groups over N with sharp increases for everybody but white men 
 but dr. <unk> one of the authors of the report said the declining rates we 're seeing for younger people we believe may be a <unk> of declining mortality in the future 
 however he stressed that the improvement depends on a continued reduction in smoking 
 even though these favorable trends in lung-cancer mortality affect all sex and race groups they ca n't be taken for granted the report says 
 smoking prevention programs should reach larger segments of the population especially children <unk> and minorities 
 an editorial in the <unk> journal says the report of declining lung-cancer mortality among young men and women in the u.s. indicates that we finally may be winning the battle this even in a country where the tobacco industry spends over $ N billion a year for promotion of the <unk> habit of smoking 
 but the editorial by jan <unk> of the world health organization notes that tobacco consumption and lung-cancer mortality rates are rising in developing countries 
 <unk> should be established as the <unk> of social behavior around the world the editorial says through the enactment of laws that limit advertising boost tobacco prices and promote <unk> education 
 asked for comment walker <unk> a vice president of the tobacco institute said new efforts to restrict tobacco advertising in the u.s. could violate the first amendment protection of free speech 
 according to the american cancer society smoking is responsible for N N of the lung-cancer cases among men and N N among women 
 the <unk> report attributes the differences in mortality rates by race to different smoking patterns 
 a higher proportion of black men smoke than white men 
 while nearly equal <unk> of black and white women currently smoke in both <unk> more whites have given up smoking than blacks

 with this treatment we have reduced deaths in high-risk colon cancer by one-third but this leaves the two-thirds who are dying of cancer 
 this is not nearly good enough 
 i believe any physician who truly <unk> about cancer patients both today and tomorrow should offer the hope of something better than that 
 my statement read <unk> from a printed text available to all reporters attending the national cancer institute news conference was the following new clinical trials are already in operation seeking to improve these results 
 these research <unk> offer to the patient not only the very best therapy which we have established today but also the hope of something still better 
 i feel any patient with high-risk cancer is getting short <unk> if he is not offered this opportunity 
 we have very exciting prospects for far more impressive advances in the treatment of colon cancer during the years immediately ahead 
 this hope however will never be realized if we use <unk> and <unk> as a <unk> point

 the oil and auto industries united in their dislike of president bush 's proposal for cars that run on alternative fuels announced a joint research program that could turn up a <unk> gasoline 
 officials of the big three auto makers and N petroleum companies said they are setting out to find the most <unk> fuel for reducing cities ' <unk> problems with no bias toward any fuel in particular 
 however their search notably wo n't include natural gas or pure <unk> the two <unk> alternative fuels in tests to be completed by next summer 
 instead the tests will focus heavily on new <unk> of gasoline which are still undeveloped but which the petroleum industry has been touting as a solution for automobile pollution that is <unk> urban areas 
 environmentalists criticized the program as merely a public-relations attempt to head off a white house proposal to require a million cars a year that run on <unk> fuels by N 
 while major oil companies have been <unk> with <unk> gasoline <unk> for years only atlantic richfield co. is now marketing a <unk> gasoline for older cars currently running on <unk> fuel 
 the initial $ N million research program will conduct the most extensive testing to date of <unk> <unk> said joe <unk> head of fuels and lubricants at general motors corp. research laboratories 
 it will compare N different <unk> of <unk> with three <unk> of up to N N <unk> 
 a second phase of research which is still being planned will test <unk> <unk> on newer engine technologies now being developed for use in N or N cars 
 there was no cost estimate for the second phase 
 the whole idea here is the automobile and oil companies have joint customers said keith <unk> a senior vice president of technology at amoco corp 
 and we are looking for the most <unk> way to clean up the air 
 but david <unk> an environmental lawyer with the natural resources defense council said the research appears merely to be a way to promote <unk> gasoline 
 oil and auto companies supported a move on capitol hill last week to gut mr. bush 's plans to require auto makers to begin selling <unk> cars by N 
 instead a house subcommittee adopted a <unk> program that specifically <unk> <unk> gasoline as an alternative

 william seidman chairman of the federal deposit insurance corp. said lincoln savings & loan association should have been seized by the government in N to contain losses that he estimated will cost taxpayers as much as $ N billion 
 mr. seidman who has been the nation 's top bank regulator inherited the problems of lincoln based in irvine calif. after his regulatory role was expanded by the new savings-and-loan bailout law 
 he made his comments before house banking committee hearings to investigate what appears to be the biggest thrift disaster in a <unk> industry 
 the inquiry also will cover the actions of charles keating jr. who is chairman of american continental corp. lincoln 's parent and who contributed heavily to several u.s. senators 
 mr. seidman told the committee that the resolution trust corp. the agency created to sell sick thrifts has studied lincoln 's examination reports by former regulators dating back to N 
 my staff indicated that had we made such findings in one of our own institutions we would have sought an immediate <unk> order to stop the hazardous operations mr. seidman said 
 when lincoln was seized by the government for example N N of its loans or $ N million were to borrowers who were buying real estate from one of american continental 's N other subsidiaries according to mr. seidman 
 but the government did n't step in until six months ago when thrift officials put lincoln into conservatorship the day after american continental filed for chapter N bankruptcy protection from creditors 
 the bankruptcy filing the government has charged in a $ N billion civil lawsuit was part of a pattern to shift insured deposits to the parent company which used the deposits as a <unk> for real-estate deals 
 the deposits that have been transferred to other subsidiaries are now under the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court 
 i think it 's fairly clear mr. keating knew that regulators were set to seize lincoln mr. seidman said 
 further investigation he said may result in further actions against lincoln 's executives said mr. seidman including fraud actions 
 mr. keating for his part has filed suit alleging that regulators <unk> seized the thrift 
 leonard <unk> an attorney in washington for mr. keating declined to comment on the hearings except to say we will be responding <unk> in several <unk> to each of these allegations at the appropriate time 
 lincoln 's treatment by former thrift regulators in an agency <unk> by the new law has proved embarrassing for five senators who received thousands of dollars in campaign contributions from mr. keating 
 mr. seidman said yesterday for example that sen. dennis <unk> d. ariz. who received $ N in contributions from mr. keating <unk> mr. seidman to request that he push for a sale of lincoln before it would be seized 
 after the government lawsuit was filed against lincoln sen. <unk> returned the campaign contributions 
 the senator 's spokesman said yesterday that he pushed for the sale of lincoln because hundreds of arizona jobs at lincoln were on the line 
 senate banking committee chairman donald <unk> d. mich has also returned contributions he received from mr. keating a year ago 
 sens. john glenn d. ohio john <unk> r. ariz. and alan cranston d. calif. also received substantial contributions from mr. keating and sought to intervene on behalf of lincoln 
 house banking committee chairman henry gonzalez d. texas said sen. cranston <unk> to appear before the house committee if necessary 
 but a committee staff member said the panel is unlikely to pursue closely the role of the senators 
 at the hearing mr. seidman said the rtc has already pumped $ N million into lincoln for liquidity 
 he also held out little hope of <unk> for purchasers of $ N million in american continental subordinated debt 
 some of those <unk> have filed a suit saying they believed they were buying <unk> certificates of deposit 
 we have no plans at this time to pay off those notes he said 
 eastern airlines ' creditors committee unhappy with the carrier 's plans for emerging from bankruptcy-law proceedings asked its own experts to devise <unk> approaches to a reorganization 
 representatives of the accounting firm of ernst & young and the securities firm of goldman sachs & co. hired by creditors to <unk> on eastern 's financial plans told the committee in a private meeting yesterday that eastern 's latest plan to emerge from bankruptcy-law protection is far riskier than an earlier one which won the creditors ' approval 
 according to one person present at the meeting eastern 's new plan is financially overly optimistic 
 asked about the consultants ' reports an eastern spokeswoman said we totally disagree 
 she said they have <unk> and made some <unk> assumptions that make their analysis completely <unk> 
 at a later news conference here frank lorenzo chairman of eastern 's parent texas air corp. said eastern was exceeding its goals for getting back into operation and predicted it would emerge from chapter N protection from creditors early next year operating with more service than it originally had scheduled 
 he insisted as he has before that creditors would be paid in full under the plan 
 mr. lorenzo made no mention of creditors ' negative response to his plan 
 we 're in the process of discussing an amended plan with the creditors and anticipate filing that amended plan shortly mr. lorenzo told reporters 
 we 're meeting and <unk> our goals he added 
 in july eastern and its creditors agreed on a reorganization plan that called for eastern to sell $ N billion in assets and to emerge from bankruptcy-law protection at two-thirds its former size 
 but after selling off pieces such as its east coast shuttle its philadelphia hub and various planes eastern hit a <unk> block 
 it could n't sell its south american routes one of the major assets marked for disposal 
 those routes valued by the creditors ' professionals at about $ N million were to be sold to amr corp. 's american airlines 
 a last-minute <unk> in negotiations with amr over an unrelated lawsuit between american and another texas air unit caused the deal to collapse 
 eastern ultimately decided it would have to keep and operate the routes itself which would leave it with less cash for its reorganization 
 it also would leave eastern a bigger carrier than the <unk> one proposed under the initial plan 
 those changes in its condition meant the reorganization plan previously presented to creditors would have to be revamped 
 since then eastern has been negotiating with creditors over revisions but the creditors committee has been having problems with the revisions 
 the committee has two groups of experts it calls on to analyze eastern 's plans 
 both said the new plan would n't work 
 ernst & young said eastern 's plans will miss its projections of earnings before interest tax and depreciation by $ N million and that eastern 's plan presented no comfort level according to a source present at yesterday 's session 
 experts from goldman sachs estimated eastern would miss the same mark by $ N million to $ N million the source said 
 the experts said they expected eastern would have to issue new debt to cover its costs and that it would generate far less cash than anticipated 
 other costs also would increase including maintenance because eastern has an older fleet 
 at the news conference mr. lorenzo and eastern president phil <unk> presented a far <unk> assessment 
 <unk> by flight attendants pilots and gate agents dressed in <unk> new blue <unk> they said eastern has exceeded its operational goals and is filling its seats 
 starting next month eastern will begin flying N flights daily instead of the previously announced N they said 
 mr. <unk> declined to give out eastern 's daily losses but said he did n't expect eastern would have to dip into the cash from asset sales currently held in escrow 
 these accounts hold several hundred million dollars primarily from asset sales 
 the plan eastern hopes to pursue he said calls for eastern to have $ N million in cash by year 's end 
 both he and mr. lorenzo predicted that plan might be confirmed in january 
 as to negotiations with creditors mr. lorenzo said in remarks after the conference we 'll have to see how they talks come along 
 however he added it 's not a requirement that the plan be accepted by creditors 
 it must be accepted by the court 
 under bankruptcy law eastern has exclusive rights for a certain period to develop its own reorganization plan 
 that deadline has been extended once and could be extended again 
 if eastern can get creditor support court confirmation of its plan could be relatively swift 
 but creditors are free to press for court approval of their own plan or the court could ignore both sides and draw its own 
 in any event some people familiar with the case question whether the court will act by january as forecast by mr. lorenzo and mr. <unk> 
 eastern sought bankruptcy-law protection a few days after a <unk> strike began march N 
 mr. lorenzo told reporters the reorganization eastern is pursuing would create a carrier N N to N N of the size of the <unk> eastern 
 he projected it would be operating about N flights a day by late spring only slightly fewer than the carrier 's old volume of N a day 
 hopes of <unk> the corporate minimum tax before N are weakening

 twelve hundred miles away <unk> at a <unk> county calif. state park are among the many who do n't quite share the enthusiasm 
 this summer speeding bikers were blamed for an accident in the <unk> county park in which a horse spooked on a trail that was closed to bikers broke its leg 
 the animal had to be destroyed the bikers fled and were never found 
 in numerous parks near san francisco <unk> have been forced to close trails set up speed <unk> and use radar guns to curb fast and reckless riding 
 they have even sent <unk> in pursuit of bikers after <unk> and <unk> complained they were being driven from trails 
 we were being <unk> says steve <unk> trails coordinator of the east bay regional park district 
 two years ago the district decided to limit the bikes to fire roads in its N <unk> acres 
 from about N six years ago the number of mountain bikes in the u.s. is expected to grow to N million in N 
 at least half that growth will have come in the past three years alone 
 the controversy kicked up by the proliferation of these <unk> <unk> is one of the most divisive <unk> to blow through the national conservation movement in recent memory 
 bikers many of them <unk> environmentalists <unk> their sport an efficient safe <unk> way to get back to nature while <unk> a right as taxpayers to <unk> on public <unk> 
 but the bikes ' <unk> numbers safety concerns and fear that they damage fragile <unk> have prompted <unk> from the <unk> to the eastern <unk> to ban them from the back country 
 key to the issue is that the bikes in <unk> hands can go virtually anywhere and in reckless hands can become vehicles of <unk> 
 an <unk> <unk> can leap from a dead stop to the top of a <unk> table without losing balance 
 such skills allow riders to fly down <unk> mountain grades at speeds of up to N miles an hour a <unk> for the <unk> but a nightmare for <unk> <unk> or <unk> 
 for <unk> <unk> managers across the nation the response is increasingly to shut the gates 
 the state of california following the lead of some regional parks recently adopted regulations that closed nearly all <unk> <unk> in state parks to mountain <unk> 
 the move largely <unk> them to roads used by <unk> vehicles 
 most other states have enacted similar bans 
 the bikes are unwelcome on trails in national parks 
 even the u.s. forest service whose <unk> <unk> philosophy permits <unk> vehicles on thousands of miles of its trails across the u.s. has begun to close some <unk> to the bikes including major portions of the popular pacific crest trail which <unk> from california to canada 
 often these closings come after vigorous <unk> lobbying by conservation organizations the politically potent sierra club among them 
 sierra has been instrumental in <unk> a number of the california bans 
 it has been <unk> an <unk> campaign to beat back a proposal pushed by utah bike groups to allow the cycles in federally designated <unk> areas where they are now prohibited 
 yet sierra 's hard-line stance has created something of a <unk> in the organization which estimates that N N of its N members own mountain bikes 
 pressure from these members prompted the club recently to soften its <unk> rhetoric it no longer for example <unk> the bikes into the same category as <unk> and other <unk> <unk> vehicles 
 but the club still insists that public <unk> ought to be closed to the bikes unless studies indicate the bikes wo n't <unk> the environment or other users

 he says fellow bikers show the same concern for the land that they demonstrated as <unk> many are <unk> that the conservation community would suddenly consider them the enemy 
 to fight back activists such as mr. <unk> are forming groups to lobby land managers over access issues and <unk> education programs to show that the bikes can <unk> share trails

 even <unk> <unk> sierra members concede that N N of all riders cause most of the problems

 bankers trust new york corp. became the latest major u.s. bank to increase reserves for its loans to less-developed countries making a $ N billion third-quarter addition to its provision 
 the bank also said it expects to report a $ N billion loss for the third quarter and a loss for the full year 
 the new reserves bring the company 's provision for loans to third world countries to $ N billion or N N of bankers trust 's medium and long-term loans to these countries 
 step up to the plate and take the big swing 
 get the problem behind you and do n't look back said james j. <unk> analyst at <unk> <unk> & woods in <unk> of the move 
 bankers trust has had the capacity to do this for some time the analyst said 
 he expects citicorp to take a similar step this year 
 citicorp yesterday reported a N N third-quarter earnings drop which analysts called a bit disappointing while manufacturers hanover corp. posted a $ N million loss for the quarter after adding $ N million to its reserve for loans to less-developed countries 
 three other major u.s. banks posted earnings increases 
 wells fargo & co. of san francisco posted a N N jump 
 <unk> financial corp. the parent of pittsburgh national bank reported net income climbed N N while net for banc one corp. of columbus ohio grew N N 
 citicorp 
 analysts were only slightly disappointed by citicorp 's numbers 
 there 's nothing in here that 's horrible and nothing to make you think they 're setting the world on fire said <unk> <unk> analyst for <unk> lawrence morgan grenfell inc 
 earnings from the bank 's global consumer business grew N N 
 the consumer business continues to drive the earnings stream said mr. <unk> of <unk> <unk> & woods 
 corporate finance and trading results in member countries of the organization for economic cooperation and development were relatively flat sometimes <unk> the bank said and profit for the area sank N N 
 the cross-border loan portfolio reflected adjustment problems and <unk> payment patterns the bank said no interest payments from argentina in the nine months and none from brazil in the third quarter while venezuela brought itself substantially current 
 overall the portfolio narrowed its quarterly loss to $ N million from $ N million a year earlier 
 people were waiting to see if we would take an additional provision for <unk> and long-term loans to less-developed countries a citicorp spokesman said 
 but he reiterated the bank 's position that it is comfortable with the current level of $ N billion covering about N N of the $ N billion of such loans outstanding 
 ronald i. <unk> analyst at sanford c. bernstein & co. called citicorp 's venture-capital gains of $ N million before taxes strong 
 a concerning item the analyst cited was the N N jump in expenses which the bank attributes to costs of expanding both its consumer credit-card operations and its overseas branch business 
 citicorp 's spokesman said however that the bank is maintaining those expenses in proportion to revenue growth 
 wells fargo 
 wells fargo continued to generate one of the highest profit margins among major banks <unk> a drop in net interest margin with N N third-quarter growth in <unk> business loans and similar growth in mortgages 
 its margin fell only seven basis points or <unk> of a percentage point from a year ago compared with a <unk> drop at security pacific corp. and much larger declines among banks in other parts of the country 
 as a result wells fargo 's net interest income rose $ N million or N N to $ N million for the quarter 
 non-interest income fell slightly to $ N million from $ N million while wells fargo continued to <unk> control non-interest expense which was almost flat at $ N million 
 the combination of solid loan growth with tight expense control gave wells fargo a N N return on average assets for the quarter about N N higher than security pacific 's and a profit ratio matched by only two or three other major banks in the u.s. 
 wells fargo 's return on equity increased to N N from N N 
 wells fargo has sold all of its <unk> loans made to less-developed countries and managed to partly reverse the sharp rise in domestic <unk> loans which fell N N from the previous quarter to $ N million from $ N million 
 but the amount was still N N higher than the year-ago level and N N higher as a percentage of total loans 
 that trend and wells fargo 's heavy exposure to leveraged buy-outs are about the only worries analysts have about wells fargo 's financial picture 
 wells fargo is rebuilding its loan-loss reserve which increased to $ N million at sept. N from $ N million the previous quarter but was down from $ N million a year ago when the bank still had some shaky foreign loans 
 manufacturers hanover 
 manufacturers hanover said that excluding the addition to its reserves certain tax benefits and a one-time $ N million gain on the sale of an interest in a foreign leasing company third-quarter earnings were $ N million 
 the comparable year-earlier number was $ N million a spokesman said 
 the bank 's additional provisions brought reserves for loans to less-developed countries to $ N billion covering N N of its medium and long-term loans outstanding to these nations 
 the net interest margin the difference between the bank 's cost of funds and what it receives as interest payments improved in the quarter as did certain areas of wholesale banking 
 fees from <unk> loans dropped N N to $ N million 
 we did n't take part in a lot of deals in the quarter because their credit quality was poor the spokesman said 
 expenses unrelated to interest rose N N to $ N million

 prime minister <unk> gandhi set a date next month for general elections that some analysts say could cost him and his ruling congress i party control of the government 
 other analysts say the indian leader could retain control with a slim majority or be forced to rule as the dominant partner in a coalition with other parties 
 elections in this large diverse and <unk> nation are always hard to predict 
 much depends on the opposition a loose group of regional and ideological parties led by former gandhi cabinet minister <unk> <unk> <unk> 
 the biggest <unk> is that the elections will be a vote for or against mr. gandhi and his five years in power five years of ups and <unk> promises and disappointments and wide fluctuations in popularity 
 yesterday four days after an unusual parliamentary defeat for the ruling party mr. gandhi called elections for the lower house of parliament on nov. N and N 
 the elections will be held in different states on one of the two days 
 the lower house 's five-year term expires in january the parliament 's upper house is appointed 
 the elections will be a <unk> test for the 45-year-old prime minister and congress i which in various forms has ruled for N of india 's N years of independence 
 after a <unk> win in N in polls held after the assassination of his mother <unk> gandhi mr. gandhi saw his popularity begin a roller <unk> ride 
 his early promises to make india a modern nation remain <unk> down in bloated bureaucracy 
 his pledge to clean up local administration and indian politics including his own party went <unk> 
 his mr. clean image was <unk> by an <unk> scandal which will be a major campaign issue 
 some analysts predict that disappointment in mr. gandhi 's spent pledge to reduce corruption and <unk> local government will crest at the polls 
 there 's a wide feeling of <unk> across the country says <unk> sen <unk> of the center for policy research in new <unk> 
 i think the people will be judging the regime by a <unk> <unk> by a corrupt revenue <unk> 
 this could be a big protest against an administrative failure 
 even if the congress i retains control of the government mr. gandhi 's ability to push through major initiatives might be <unk> by a <unk> majority 
 economic analysts call his <unk> <unk> of the indian economy incomplete and many are hoping for major new <unk> if he is returned firmly to power 
 the <unk> <unk> or lower house of parliament has N elected and two appointed seats 
 in N the congress i captured N seats the largest victory in the history of indian democracy 
 the <unk> was fueled by panic that prevailed in india at the time 
 mrs. gandhi had been <unk> by <unk> <unk> and many indians feared their country might split apart 
 in the previous three general elections similar national issues <unk> the vote 
 in N the congress party won after india 's victory in the <unk> war 
 in N mrs. gandhi was thrown out of office after her <unk> emergency rule and in N after her <unk> made a mess of their three years in power she was restored to office 
 most political analysts say that if mr. gandhi 's opposition <unk> to field single candidates in most <unk> the congress i will lose big 
 but if the opposition remains <unk> the congress i could win a small majority or lead a coalition government 
 <unk> mehta a <unk> and former gandhi ally predicts congress i will win only N seats a quarter of the house if the opposition fields single candidates in N N of the races 
 analysts say the opposition will struggle this week to <unk> and its success will be clear only when it <unk> its final list of parliamentary candidates 
 the <unk> scandal is likely to be one of the big talking points in the campaign but it 's unclear how it is viewed by average indian voters 
 in N india signed a $ N billion contract with ab bofors a unit of nobel industries sweden ab to purchase N <unk> pieces 
 the contract was negotiated by the countries ' two prime ministers and was supposed to be free of commissions or agents ' costs 
 in april N evidence surfaced that commissions were paid 
 the opposition charged that the money was used to bribe indian government officials an <unk> denied by mr. gandhi 's administration 
 but many of his statements on the issue in parliament subsequently were proven wrong by <unk> evidence 
 the scandal has faded and <unk> but recent disclosures propelled it back onto the front pages and that has helped <unk> the opposition which last week blocked passage of two constitutional amendment bills 
 it was the first time in N years that such government bills were defeated 
 in a country where a bribe is needed to get a phone a job and even into a school the name bofors has become a potent <unk> cry against the government 
 that illustrates the kind of disappointment many indians feel toward mr. gandhi whom they <unk> elected and <unk> supported in his first two years in power 
 his term has produced no spectacular failures in politics in the economy or on the military front and has <unk> up some successes 
 but the average indian had tremendous hope in the <unk> leader and his promise to make both government and the ruling party more effective and less corrupt 
 his failures in those two areas deeply and sometimes bitterly disappointed many indians 
 we do n't like the congress i says <unk> <unk> a farmer in the western state of <unk> 
 the congress government is taking the farmers ' bread and not giving us any support 
 when there are well problems light problems road problems the government tells us to forget it 
 the greatest thing going for mr. gandhi and the congress i party is the poor reputation of the opposition 
 even if it <unk> for the elections its <unk> is likely to be temporary 
 when the congress i lost the N election following mrs. gandhi 's <unk> emergency rule a similar coalition took power and then <unk> 
 many indians fear a repeat of that experience

 but bond investors continue to keep a close watch on the jittery stock market 
 in early trading investors were bidding bond prices higher as stocks tumbled and fears mounted that friday 's stock market debacle would be repeated 
 but a partial recovery in the dow jones industrial average which had been down more than N points in midmorning dashed those expectations 
 treasury bonds also were hurt late in the day by a $ N billion offering by the tennessee valley authority and the prospect of a huge amount of new agency debt 
 bond investors were hoping that stock prices would continue to fall said roger early a vice president at federated investors inc. pittsburgh 
 when stocks stabilized that was a disappointment 
 meanwhile for the second straight day the bond market paid little attention to the federal reserve 's open market operations 
 fed officials <unk> more cash into the banking system by arranging $ N billion of repurchase agreements during the usual <unk> intervention period 
 the move was meant to keep a lid on interest rates and to boost investor confidence 
 the intervention has been friendly meaning that they really did n't have to do it said maria <unk> ramirez money-market economist at drexel burnham lambert inc 
 she said a more aggressive move was n't needed 
 the fed also appears reluctant to ease credit conditions further 
 it already has allowed the closely watched federal funds rate to decline N percentage point to about N N N from its previous target level of about N N 
 the rate which banks charge each other on overnight loans is considered an early signal of changes in fed policy 
 it ended at about N N N yesterday but was as low as N N N monday

 mortgage-backed securities 
 the derivative mortgage-backed market revived after a brief <unk> as two new remics totaling $ N million were offered and talk circulated about two more issues that could be priced today 
 the revival of the real estate mortgage investment <unk> market reflected the relative calm in the mortgage market after two days of volatile trading 
 dealers noted that it 's difficult to structure new remics when prices are moving widely 
 the two remics priced were a $ N million federal home loan mortgage corp. issue underwritten by salomon brothers inc. and a $ N million federal national mortgage association deal underwritten by greenwich capital markets 
 the remic issuance supported prices of freddie mac and fannie mae securities which held up better than government national mortgage association securities during an afternoon sell-off

 a house-senate conference approved an estimated $ N billion fiscal N spending bill that provides a N N increase for space research and development and <unk> far-reaching provisions affecting the federal mortgage market 
 the current ceiling on home loans insured by the federal housing administration would be increased to $ N 
 separately the bill gives authority to the bush administration to facilitate the refinancing of federally subsidized loans for low-income and <unk> homeowners 
 the second provision affecting so-called N mortgages has met strong opposition from investment bankers represented by the public securities association 
 and a <unk> of influential former senate aides employed by the wall street firm salomon brothers came to the capitol in a <unk> attempt to strip the provision 
 by an N margin senate negotiators voted to preserve the N mortgage refinancing plan and despite powerful allies the opposition found itself undercut by an unusual alliance of liberals and conservatives 
 the government currently is subsidizing an estimated N loans above N N under the N program and however <unk> to private investors the refinancing is expected to yield at least $ N million in savings in fiscal N 
 this sum has been <unk> <unk> by <unk> anxious to offset spending elsewhere and conservative sen. phil <unk> cast the fight as a <unk> stand against <unk> interests 
 we are <unk> here not of the mortgage companies but the taxpayers said the texas republican 
 the action came as the administration won final congressional approval of $ N million in assistance for elections scheduled in nicaragua in february 
 the bulk of the money would be <unk> through the national <unk> for democracy but the legislation is so <unk> written that it has been dogged by questions regarding the money 's true purpose and its ultimate <unk> 
 the senate had refused late friday to <unk> <unk> and limit debate but behind the bipartisan leadership a solid majority took shape yesterday and brushed aside amendments seeking to cut the total package or steer it away from direct aid to political parties 
 final approval on a N roll call was never in doubt but the opposition drew an unusual mix of senators including republicans <unk> <unk> and warren <unk> and democrats bill bradley and john glenn 
 the money will be applied for voter registration and election monitoring but more than half is likely to go to the union <unk> <unk> party 
 critics warned such cash contributions may only undercut the opposition party 's standing and one irony is that under nicaraguan law a major portion of the opposition party 's funds must be shared with the government 's supreme electoral council 
 within the appropriations conference yesterday the $ N billion measure is the second largest of the annual domestic spending bills and covers a <unk> collection of accounts for science housing veterans and the environment 
 the decision to raise the ceiling on fha home loans still faces strong opposition in the house 
 but it is driven by the same fiscal pressures that have forced lawmakers to resort to various <unk> devices to <unk> as much as $ N billion in spending that would otherwise put the bill over budget 
 these costs will complicate the budget picture in fiscal N and the measure further <unk> congress to a set of costly projects including the first construction funds for the space station 
 the station is promised $ N billion within the $ N billion provided for research and development in the national aeronautics and space administration and the nation 's <unk> aerospace plane cut by the senate could receive as much as $ N million in new funds or transfers 
 similarly the house agreed to add back $ N million to continue work on the advanced communications technology satellite being developed by general electric co 
 and while setting a statutory limit of $ N billion on the automated space probe the conference appropriated $ N million for the start-up of the <unk> mission a successor to the <unk> space probe 
 among major domestic agencies the environmental protection agency stands to receive increases significantly beyond those sought by the administration with pollution <unk> and control accounts growing by N N to about $ N million 
 an estimated $ N billion is separately allocated for the national science foundation and within the housing and urban development department more than $ N billion is provided for federally <unk> housing including an expanded effort to modernize public housing units that serve the poorest families 
 to an unusual degree the massive bill has become a vehicle for lawmakers to <unk> funds for projects in home states 
 while the practice was discouraged in the past the conference agreement is <unk> with veterans ' hospitals environmental projects and urban grants designated for specific communities 
 the most striking example yesterday may have been in community development funds where the two houses had separately approved a total of N projects valued at $ N million and the conference added N more valued at $ N million to <unk> preserve balance between the house and senate 
 yesterday 's conference agreement is the second major bill to emerge from negotiations this week as <unk> approved a fiscal N transportation bill late monday that includes a sweeping ban on smoking on most domestic airline flights 
 an exemption will remain for flights longer than six hours to hawaii and alaska but estimates by the tobacco industry yesterday indicate all but about N flights would be covered 
 separately a third conference report covering an $ N billion treasury and postal service bill was sent to the senate after passing the house on a N roll call yesterday 
 and after weeks of delay the appropriations process is beginning to take some final shape 
 defense and foreign aid are the two most critical areas remaining from the administration 's standpoint 
 and among domestic programs the most serious threat is white house opposition to abortion riders attached to separate bills funding the district of columbia and department of health and human services 
 the same issue threatens to spill over to the foreign aid debate and mr. bush also is threatening to veto any agreement that <unk> <unk> provisions renewing u.s. support for the united nations fund for population activities 
 in a sharply written letter rep. david <unk> chairman of the house appropriations subcommittee for foreign operations warned mr. bush that the result of his <unk> could weaken efforts to accommodate the administration elsewhere 
 as a result of your <unk> writes the wisconsin democrat i guess there is no longer any point in taking administration views into account on other items in conference <unk> regardless of their resolution you apparently intend to veto this bill 
 markets usually get noticed because they soar or plunge 
 gold which has n't risen or fallen significantly in quite some time yesterday achieved what may be a new level of <unk> the most actively traded futures contracts closed unchanged despite nervous fluctuations in both the dollar and the stock market 
 the settlement prices of the december february and april gold contracts were even with monday 's final prices 
 the december N contract which has the greatest trading volume ended at $ N an ounce 
 the other months posted advances of N cents to N cents an ounce 
 according to one analyst bernard savaiko of painewebber new york the stock market 's ability on monday to rally from last friday 's decline which seemed to indicate that the economy was n't going to fall either took the <unk> out of precious metals prices and out of gold 's in particular 
 yesterday gold traded within a narrow range 
 gold tried to rally on monday but ran into the same situation that has subdued gold prices for more than a year selling by gold producers who want to fix the highest possible price for their gold 
 december delivery gold is trading in a range of $ N to $ N an ounce and is having difficulty breaking out above that mr. savaiko said 
 producers at the moment regard that area a good one in which to sell gold 
 also mr. savaiko noted stock market investors seeking greater safety are <unk> toward buying bonds rather than precious metals because we are <unk> more toward a <unk> economy that does n't make gold and precious metals attractive 
 jeffrey <unk> president of <unk> canada toronto precious metals advisers said there is little to <unk> gold traders to buy the metal 
 investors in the u.s. and europe are comfortable with the actions of the federal reserve in its willingness to supply liquidity to financial system which helped the stock market rebound on monday he said 
 there is n't any rush on the part of investors in the west to buy gold he said 
 they still bear the memory of october N when they bought gold after the stock market <unk> and ended up losing money because gold prices subsequently fell mr. <unk> said 
 it 's an experience they do n't want to repeat 
 at the moment gold traders are n't concerned about inflation he said and as for the dollar gold 's association with the currency has been <unk> recently so drops in the currency are n't having much impact on gold 
 <unk> mehta chief bullion trader for chase manhattan bank said there is little incentive on the part of traders to sell gold because the stock market may go lower and gold may retain some of its flight to safety quality 
 there is little incentive to buy gold because if the stock market goes higher it may be just a false alarm 
 this is keeping the gold traders <unk> 
 the most remarkable feature about yesterday 's action was that the price of roughly $ N an ounce was regarded as attractive enough by gold producers around the world to aggressively sell gold mr. mehta said 
 i do n't know what it means over the long run but for the short term it appears that gold producers are <unk> for the $ N or so that gold has risen over the past week or so he said 
 previously he noted gold producers <unk> to back off from a rising gold market letting prices rise as much as possible before selling 
 mr. mehta observed that the u.s. merchandise trade deficit which rose sharply in august according to yesterday 's report has been having less and less impact on the gold market 
 the dollar has n't reacted much to it so gold has n't either he said 
 in other commodity markets yesterday

 the march contract advanced N cent a pound to N cents 
 according to an analyst cuba ca n't meet all its shipment commitments and has asked japan to accept a delay of shipments scheduled for later this year into early next year 
 japan is perceived as a wealthy nation that can turn elsewhere in the world market and buy the sugar the analyst said 
 it was the possibility of this demand that helped firm prices the analyst said 
 another analyst noted that cuba has been deferring shipments in recent years 
 to the professionals in the trade it did n't cause much surprise 
 the march futures contract traded as high as N cents but could n't sustain the advance he said 
 livestock and <unk> 
 the prices of cattle <unk> and pork <unk> futures contracts rebounded as livestock traders shook off fears that the friday stock market plunge would <unk> consumer spending which in turn would hurt retail sales of beef and pork

 grains and soybeans 
 the prices of most soybean and <unk> futures contracts rose amid rumors that the soviet union is interested in buying from the u.s. or south america about N metric tons of soybeans and as many as N metric tons of soybean <unk>

 small-business groups also will fight the <unk> provision of legislation that would expand parental leaves

 there is also worry that the <unk> commission studying long-term health care will again push lawmakers toward <unk> solutions

 moody 's investors service inc. said it lowered ratings on about $ N million of beatrice co. debt citing the closely held chicago food concern 's proposed recapitalization 
 the ratings concern said it downgraded beatrice notes <unk> and certain industrial revenue bonds to <unk> from <unk> and the company 's subordinated debentures to <unk> from <unk> 
 moody 's said the proposed <unk> may limit the company 's ability to realize its profit potential and that paying dividends from a new series of preferred could squeeze basic business operations 
 a beatrice spokesman did n't return calls seeking comment 
 beatrice which went private in an $ N billion leveraged buy-out in N said last month that it might borrow again to help pay investors as much as $ N million in preferred stock and debt securities 
 when the soviets announced their last <unk> had left afghanistan in february the voices of skepticism were all but <unk> out by an international chorus of euphoria 
 it was the soviets ' vietnam 
 the kabul regime would fall 
 millions of refugees would rush home 
 a resistance government would walk into kabul 
 those who bought that illusion are now <unk> 
 eight months after gen. <unk> <unk> walked across the bridge into the u.s.s.r. a <unk> regime remains in kabul the refugees sit in their camps and the restoration of afghan freedom seems as far off as ever 
 but there never was a chance that the afghan resistance would <unk> the kabul regime quickly and easily 
 soviet leaders said they would support their kabul clients by all means necessary and did 
 the u.s. said it would fully support the resistance and did n't 
 with the february N u.n. accords relating to afghanistan the soviet union got everything it needed to consolidate permanent control 
 the terms of the geneva accords leave moscow free to provide its clients in kabul with assistance of any kind including the return of soviet ground forces while requiring the u.s. and pakistan to cut off aid 
 the only fly in the soviet <unk> was the last-minute addition of a <unk> american <unk> that u.s. aid to the resistance would continue as long as soviet aid to kabul did 
 but as soon as the accords were signed american officials sharply reduced aid 
 in february N when the soviets said they had completed their pullout the u.s. cut it further 
 not so the soviets 
 gen. <unk> himself said soviet troops expected to leave behind more than $ N billion of military equipment and installations for the kabul regime 
 since the troop withdrawal moscow has poured in an additional $ N to $ N million worth per month nearly $ N billion since february equivalent to the total u.s. aid to the resistance in nine years 
 this includes what deputy foreign minister <unk> <unk> <unk> called new peaceful <unk> weapons including more than N <unk> missiles 
 by early may moscow had delivered for example N trucks about N tanks <unk> and hundreds of other combat vehicles 
 later that month it added an entire tank <unk> including N <unk> tanks and more than N <unk> <unk> <unk> fighting vehicles 
 by september a new reinforced <unk> <unk> <unk> with an additional N combat vehicles N more trucks and N <unk> afghan troops had arrived in <unk> 
 in the last few weeks moscow has added <unk> missiles the bomber version of the <unk> <unk> <unk> aircraft <unk> which can <unk> pakistan 's <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> which can <unk> the <unk> 
 moscow claims this is all needed to protect the kabul regime against the guerrilla resistance 
 it is well-known that the regular afghan <unk> is filled with reluctant <unk> 
 but this is not the entire afghan army and it is no longer kabul 's only military force 
 complete units have been trained and <unk> in the u.s.s.r. and other east bloc nations N to N of these troops have returned 
 in addition the regime has established <unk> <unk> forces totaling more than N including N <unk> troops of the interior ministry <unk> which still is directed by N soviet kgb officers 
 even if not all these forces are committed to the regime they are now dependent on it 
 and thousands of afghan children have been taken to the soviet union where they are <unk> for the behavior of their families 
 since N indian military advisers have been <unk> the kabul regime 
 in preparation for the withdrawal moscow kabul and new <unk> signed two agreements for several hundred newly civilian indian experts to replace some of the more visible soviet military personnel 
 cuban military personnel also have been active in afghanistan since N 
 the soviets cut a deal with iran a future iranian role in afghanistan in exchange for iranian support of soviet policy 
 the deal was <unk> by the restoration of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the afghan prime ministry 
 moreover serious questions have been raised about the claimed withdrawal of soviet forces 
 before his assassination in N president <unk> of pakistan repeatedly stated that fresh soviet troops were being inserted into afghanistan even as others were <unk> withdrawn 
 rep. bill <unk> r. fla. reports that these included N to N soviet central asian kgb border guards <unk> <unk> from <unk> and wearing <unk> <unk> 
 meanwhile the kabul regime is increasingly successful at portraying the resistance as <unk> <unk> 
 in this they are aided by years of american european <unk> and saudi support for the most extreme <unk> radical <unk> <unk> with leaders whose policies are <unk> to the afghan public 
 this heavy outside support for the worst has undermined better moderate leaders 
 in autumn last year for example the regime garrison at <unk> was prepared to surrender the city to resistance <unk> 
 at the last minute however <unk> officials sent in <unk> <unk> perhaps the most <unk> and feared of the <unk> with a demand that the surrender be made to his forces 
 the deal fell through and <unk> remains a major regime base 
 the resistance lacks not only air power <unk> and expertise but often such <unk> as <unk> mine detectors or even winter <unk> 
 experienced resistance <unk> wanted to use guerrilla action and <unk> tactics to wear down the regime 
 instead they were pressured by pakistan 's isi the channel for their support into attacking <unk> 
 they took more than N N <unk> journalists report that they faced <unk> without mine detectors 
 the wonder is not that the resistance has failed to topple the kabul regime but that it continues to exist and fight at all 
 last summer in response to congressional criticism the state department and the cia said they had resumed military aid to the resistance months after it was cut off but it is not clear how much is being sent or when it will arrive 
 for months the resistance has been <unk> against air attack 
 thus far there is no indication that they have been <unk> with <unk> or other <unk> weapons 
 indeed u.s. officials have indicated to the press that the <unk> of aid depends on what success the weakened resistance <unk> by the end of this year 
 moscow and kabul must have found that information useful 
 for a decade u.s. policy has been <unk> based on <unk> and the defense of bureaucratic and political turf 
 no settlement negotiated by others can force the afghan people to give up their struggle 
 a <unk> of u.s. military aid would merely abandon them to die in <unk> 
 creation of a new realistic u.s. policy is long overdue 
 ms. <unk> editor and co-author of afghanistan the great game <unk> freedom house directs the freedom house program on <unk> asia 
 nothing <unk> the soul of ronald reagan and his <unk> as much as the crusade to aid nicaragua 's contra rebels or the dream of building a <unk> defense shield to knock out soviet nuclear missiles 
 yet under mr. reagan 's preferred successor president bush those two <unk> <unk> causes are <unk> on the <unk> 
 and surprisingly little more than a <unk> of protest is being heard even though <unk> once <unk> fire supporting the contras and the strategic defense initiative 
 the programs have <unk> says rep. henry <unk> a conservative republican from illinois 
 yet he asserts you look around and you say who are the leaders 
 who is going to carry the water 
 it is n't surprising that president bush has n't led a crusade to pump up the contras or sdi 
 though he <unk> supports both programs mr. bush has n't been a <unk> champion of either cause as mr. reagan was 
 what 's surprising is that there is n't more of a conservative outcry as the bush administration lets the programs slip down the <unk> list 
 a combination of factors a <unk> among some conservatives a decline in the perception of a soviet threat and a <unk> with other issues seem to explain the strange <unk> 
 above all though conservative republicans who have <unk> both the contras and sdi are reluctant to attack a republican president for failing to do more though that reluctance may be <unk> 
 we want to complain we want to say something about it and we 're going to as it gets worse says rep. dan burton an indiana republican who has been a <unk> contra backer 
 but it 's like <unk> your father in the <unk> 
 you hate to do it because he 's your father 
 mr. burton says conservatives ' <unk> with mr. bush 's cautious handling of the recent unsuccessful coup in panama will make them more willing to speak out 
 of course neither president bush nor the congress has actually abandoned the contras or sdi 
 mr. bush has struck a deal with congressional leaders to provide <unk> aid to the contras until nicaragua holds national elections next february 
 but the administration has dropped any effort to win military aid for the rebels 
 and the administration 's deal with congress gives several congressional committees the right to cut off even humanitarian aid next month though the committees are likely to let aid continue until february 
 most analysts think there 's little prospect the contras can be a significant fighting force without u.s. arms and after the february election their future in any form will be <unk> at best 
 instead of focusing on the contras mr. bush has switched to urging members of congress most recently in a white house meeting yesterday to approve financing for the election campaign of political opponents of nicaragua 's sandinista government 
 the administration continues to support sdi or star wars and it recently lobbied to persuade the senate to restore some of the funds it planned to cut from the program 
 and just last week defense secretary dick cheney gave a strong speech listing compelling reasons to push ahead with sdi and saying he 'd urge president bush to veto a defense bill with inadequate funding for the program 
 but the strong pitch by mr. cheney may be too little too late to prevent damage to sdi 
 the house has already voted for a deep cut in funding and in the end the program 's backers will be hard pressed to head off some reduction in spending next year 
 and while the defense secretary is speaking out president bush himself has n't launched any <unk> campaign to drum up support as president reagan did 
 the administration also acknowledges that it is n't pursuing mr. reagan 's original vision of an <unk> shield protecting the whole u.s. but rather a more modest version 
 more <unk> to sdi supporters the bush administration appears to have <unk> accepted a new arms-control proposal from the soviet union that <unk> long-term trouble for star wars 
 the soviets have agreed to complete a treaty cutting strategic weapons without including restrictions on <unk> defenses 
 but the soviets also are insisting that they will reserve the right to withdraw from the completed <unk> treaty later on if the u.s. does sdi testing or <unk> that the soviets think violates the existing <unk> treaty 
 it will be hard down the road to persuade congress to approve money for sdi plans if lawmakers fear those plans could scuttle a completed treaty 
 as a result frank <unk> a former reagan pentagon aide who now heads the center for security policy charges that the administration 's <unk> of continued commitment to development and <unk> of the sdi program strain <unk> 
 still proponents may be <unk> away from more <unk> because they sense political <unk> have turned against <unk> the nicaraguan rebels or boosting spending on sdi particularly when the public <unk> the soviet threat is declining under mikhail gorbachev 
 in fact because communism seems to be beating a global retreat some conservatives may simply be so pleased that their <unk> philosophy is prevailing that they do n't have the fire at the moment to push controversial programs 
 the short of it is that the most <unk> among us can not get into too sour a mood with communism <unk> says mitchell <unk> a former reagan white house aide who now is president of the hudson institute 
 some activists are <unk> to raise the profile of the two causes 
 but they say they ca n't make much <unk> because of a lack of willing leaders in a position to turn the tide 
 one longtime champion of these programs in congress republican whip <unk> <unk> of georgia is <unk> by questions about his ethics conservatives note 
 other conservative <unk> like wyoming republican sen. malcolm <unk> a longtime sdi advocate do n't have the clout with the bush white house that they enjoyed with president reagan 
 above all though proponents say neither the contra nor the sdi cause can be pushed much further without more presidential support 
 for there to be wind in the <unk> of any program the chief executive has to be <unk> in the <unk> says rep. burton 
 all this causes rep. <unk> to <unk> about an <unk> way to drum up more enthusiasm 
 what i 'd like to see if he is up to it is for reagan to take to the <unk> to <unk> enthusiasm for sdi the congressman says 
 we 're sorry to report that on monday president bush accepted the resignation of william allen as chairman of the u.s. civil rights commission 
 mr. allen appointed by president reagan grew <unk> tired of dealing with the guerrilla tactics of his enemies 
 his recent speech <unk> titled blacks animals <unk> what is a minority caused an <unk> when its title <unk> out 
 mr. allen 's commissioners voted to call his <unk> speech <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> 
 commissioner mary francis berry said it was another sad episode in the <unk> of the <unk> missile who is chairman 
 rep. don edwards the california democrat warned mr. allen that the speech would be outside the scope of the commission 's jurisdiction 
 thomas <unk> head of the <unk> legal defense fund called the prospect of the speech frankly <unk> 
 we 've actually read the speech 
 mr. allen began it with a warning to his hosts a california church group that opposes rights for <unk> 
 he said that other participants in the conference do not believe that the rights of americans should be guaranteed to citizens who are homosexual but that i mean to persuade you to the opposite view 
 he recalled to the audience a strange <unk> <unk> he once heard arguing now that we have finally recognized that american blacks have rights we need to do the same for animals 
 mr. allen <unk> to this <unk> because it seems to <unk> the status of blacks to that of animals as a mere project of charity of <unk> 
 rights on such a basis whether for blacks or <unk> are mere <unk> he said subject to being taken back 
 he says the title of his speech was to make his point that americans have rights as individuals not as members of certain select groups 
 his speech criticized the <unk> of <unk> of protected groups in society as opposed to individual <unk> or as he put it in a common <unk> as americans 
 instead of lobbying for special treatment mr. allen said that <unk> and others should try to ensure equal treatment under the law and not aim for special privileges that would risk <unk> <unk> with government <unk> 
 this hardly sounds like an <unk> <unk> 
 what 's really going on here 
 the three most important things to understand about mr. allen is that he is a black conservative intellectual a triple threat to the liberal establishment 
 mr. allen who teaches government at prestigious <unk> <unk> college in california and will remain a member of the commission has spent years arguing that civil rights are individuals ' rights 
 he last made waves when he <unk> to defend an indian girl who had been adopted by <unk> parents off her <unk> 
 mr. allen quickly ran up against the liberal establishment again which somehow <unk> the vague concept of indian rights above the rights of individual indians 
 there is a huge divide between mr. allen 's <unk> view and the divisive litigation approach of the civil rights groups 
 indeed the gap is so large that mr. allen 's critics refuse to engage the debate 
 their <unk> of him is no substitute for argument 
 their effort to run him out of washington is an embarrassment to the original purpose of their own movement 
 we hope the next head of the civil rights commission will be as <unk> as mr. allen in making the case for <unk> of civil rights

 polaroid corp. benefiting from <unk> savings reported a strong gain in third-quarter operating results and net income of $ N million or N cents a share after <unk> requirements 
 analysts said the numbers were better than expectations partly because of strong profit margins and a positive foreign-currency translation 
 however they said the company 's flat revenue was a disappointment and an indication that sales of polaroid 's new conventional film in the u.s. have been sluggish 
 revenue in the third quarter was $ N million almost unchanged from $ N million a year earlier 
 polaroid reported operating profit before taxes and interest costs of $ N million for the third quarter more than double the <unk> $ N million 
 charges for staff cuts and other restructuring produced a net loss of $ N million or N cents a share in N 's third quarter 
 i 'm somewhat skeptical about the underlying demand for polaroid products said michael <unk> an analyst with wertheim schroder & co 
 if you believe that a good performance next year is contingent on an acceleration of revenue there is n't a lot here to base optimism on 
 alex henderson an analyst with prudential-bache says polaroid officials told him yesterday that u.s. sales of the company 's new conventional film product introduced in the second quarter have been disappointing after a promising start 
 sam <unk> a polaroid spokesman said i do n't know about disappointing but added that the company has n't been able to get the product on the shelves of some <unk> discount retailers that it had hoped would be carrying the product already 
 mr. <unk> said the film one film is currently carried at about N retail outlets including <unk> and supermarkets

 why is the stock market suddenly so volatile 
 yesterday the dow jones industrial average did a now familiar dance it plunged N points before lunch with most of the drop <unk> in N minutes 
 then it rebounded to finish down only N points 
 and those swings <unk> <unk> friday 's 190.58-point plunge and monday 's <unk> recovery 
 it 's <unk> that in an hour you can <unk> off so much value says stanford <unk> chairman of trinity investment management corp. boston 
 and apparently it is here to stay 
 richard bernstein senior <unk> analyst at merrill lynch & co says my gut feel is that we 'll live with those swings for a while 
 there are many reasons for the market 's <unk> new trading vehicles such as stock-index futures and options computer-driven strategies like program trading and crowd psychology 
 but most are linked by a single theme liquidity the ability to get in and out of the market quickly 
 prices are moving up and down so fast because investors are <unk> ways to turn over shares at <unk> rates and increasingly acting in concert 
 institutions are <unk> animals says peter anderson who heads the <unk> management arm of <unk> financial services inc 
 we watch the same indicators and listen to the same <unk> 
 like <unk> we tend to move in the same direction at same time 
 and that naturally <unk> price movements 
 institutions who now account for most trading count on being able to buy and sell big blocks of stock at an <unk> 
 but when they discover that markets are n't always as liquid as they supposed markets jump 
 on monday for instance howard ward a principal at <unk> stevens & clark found that you could n't buy <unk> at quoted prices without paying up 
 and when many firms had to pay up monday 's sudden rally was sparked 
 trading in futures and options some people believe can add to volatility 
 investors believe they can can rely on such derivative securities to get in and out of the stock market without actually selling any stocks that is a way of staying liquid even when they own stocks 
 these and other modern trading methods tend to promote dramatic shifts in assets says george douglas first vice president at drexel burnham lambert inc 
 it 's the idea that what goes in easy can come out easy so that <unk> of higher volatility get built into the stock market 
 one new investment style called asset allocation shifts portfolio <unk> between stocks bonds and cash when computer models say one is more attractive 
 for instance first <unk> corp. an asset <unk> based in morristown n.j. said it quickly boosted stock positions in its aggressive accounts to N N from N N to take advantage of plunging prices friday 
 it added another N N monday before stocks rallied 
 when they did the firm reduced those stock holdings to about N N 
 a classic example of institutions ' <unk> for liquidity is portfolio insurance now widely <unk> 
 before the N crash an estimated $ N billion in institutional money was managed under this hedging technique 
 the idea was to insure the value of a portfolio by selling futures when stock prices dropped eliminating the need to sell the stocks themselves 
 but in october N when portfolio insurers rushed to sell at the same time they <unk> both the stock and futures markets 
 yet even today institutions are quietly practicing forms of portfolio insurance by nervously rushing to and <unk> in the markets 
 others are doing index arbitrage a strategy of taking advantage of price discrepancies between stocks and futures 
 unlike traditional <unk> strategies all of the above require that market makers be on hand to provide liquidity by buying and selling stocks in a crunch 
 but institutions say wall street brokerage firms are less willing to make markets 
 brokers do n't deny that 
 wall street traders say that with institutional brokerage commissions far lower than in the 1970s securities firms ca n't afford to take the risk of buying too much stock 
 i think everyone 's a little more leery says jack baker head of equity trading at <unk> lehman hutton inc 
 the institutions have driven commission rates down to the point where it makes no sense to commit capital says tom <unk> senior executive vice president in charge of institutional trading at oppenheimer & co 
 why should i risk money for a guy for who 's paying me five cents a dance 
 all you get is risk 
 lack of liquidity can also result from exchange reforms 
 many traders say that circuit breakers put in place to damp volatility after the N crash actually added to volatility when the stock market plunged friday 
 the circuit breakers caused a <unk> shutdown in trading in standard & poor 's 500-stock index futures contract as the markets were falling 
 with the <unk> halt you could only sell stocks to cut exposure to the market says a money manager 
 it was scary to people thinking that they could n't get their trades off 
 it was like they put you in a room with a <unk> and told you there were three doors to exit said one chicago-based futures trader 
 then they said by the way two of the doors are locked 
 the takeover mania also adds to volatility 
 ual corp. is a good example 
 valued as a buy-out target the airline stock was trading at nearly $ N a share 
 when the deal ran into trouble the stock tumbled it closed at $ N yesterday 
 presumably ual is now trading closer to its value based on earnings 
 by contrast traditional <unk> investors are unlikely to generate sudden price moves 
 scott black a <unk> money manager who heads <unk> management inc. points out that for those who invest on fundamentals the value of a stock from day to day does n't change all that much 
 some experts say markets are n't as volatile as widely assumed 
 <unk> stoll finance professor at <unk> university says the current volatility in u.s. markets <unk> in comparison to the 1930s decades before derivative instruments such as options and futures were introduced 
 i just ca n't believe that the <unk> in the financial market are causing any of this volatility he says 
 and robert d. <unk> president of asset <unk> first <unk> notes that before friday 's tailspin daily volatility on the new york stock exchange in recent weeks had reached historically low levels 
 some people tend to ignore that a <unk> move is less in percentage terms than it was when the stock market was lower 
 john j. phelan jr. chairman of the big board asserts that N and N have been two of the least volatile years in the last N or N years 
 but the low average volatility mr. phelan is talking about is n't any comfort in a period of rapid stock-market moves like the past week 
 in addition sanford <unk> a <unk> school finance professor says volatile <unk> in stock prices will continue as long as liquidity falls short of the <unk> demands of institutions who can go out and say i have a billion dollars of stocks to sell 
 some people think the search for liquidity is <unk> 
 in N john maynard <unk> wrote that of the <unk> of orthodox finance none surely is more <unk> than the <unk> of liquidity 
 it leads investors to focus on short-term price movements a game of musical chairs he called it rather than on long-term fundamental valuation

 the national aeronautics and space administration said a computer virus has infected one of its networks and is spreading anti-nuclear messages related to its galileo space probe which is to be launched today 
 charles redmond a nasa spokesman said the agency discovered the virus on monday on the collection of computer networks <unk> called <unk> and expected N university centers to be infected by today 
 although the network is n't connected to the computer systems that operate either galileo or the shuttle part of the network will carry <unk> of galileo data once the craft gets <unk> 
 mr. redmond said the <unk> had n't yet done any harm but the agency feared garbage data could be <unk> for real data 
 he estimated it could take a day for a computer security manager to <unk> the virus from a computer system 
 the <unk> among the <unk> yet to hit a research network appeared to affect only digital equipment corp. hardware that uses digital 's <unk> operating system 
 it is unrelated to the <unk> virus that last year infected <unk> a much larger network used by researchers at universities laboratories and government agencies around the world 
 in the <unk> of computer security the nasa <unk> is technically a computer worm mr. redmond said 
 a worm <unk> in the operating system of a computer and spreads by boring into other computers contacted through networks 
 the galileo worm apparently was <unk> on a computer in france <unk> up to nasa 's space physics analysis network mr. redmond said 
 nasa said the galileo worm had n't affected its computers or the computers of other government agencies because they had modified their systems to reject <unk> 
 but mr. redmond said the worm hit universities that had n't elected to make the changes 
 michael alexander a senior editor at <unk> a trade publication said he was told that the worm gets into a computer center by looking for obvious <unk> such as ones that are the same as the user 's name 
 if it finds one and gets into the system it will display a screen when a user <unk> on that says <unk> against nuclear <unk> 
 you talk of times of peace for all and then prepare for war 
 in addition mr. alexander said the worm sends strange messages to other machines at the center such as george <unk> was an <unk> or do n't feed the <unk> tonight 
 the worm also looks for <unk> <unk> that <unk> more privileges on the user 
 the <unk> are included in the system software when it is installed but are supposed to be replaced as soon as the system is up and running 
 if it finds one of those <unk> mr. alexander said the worm will do such things as change users ' <unk> to a series of random numbers preventing them from signing on to the network 
 nasa estimated that on monday about four computer centers were affected 
 yesterday the number grew to N today the number is expected to grow to N 
 nasa said it will take about a week before it knows exactly how many centers of the N connected to <unk> were affected and the extent of the damage if any 
 anti-nuclear activists have <unk> the launch of the galileo space probe to jupiter because it uses <unk> to generate the electricity needed to run the craft 
 activists fear that if the shuttle carrying galileo into <unk> should <unk> or if galileo itself crashes into the earth during the two times it flies close to the planet fatal levels of <unk> would be released into the atmosphere 
 so far galileo has been delayed twice once because of a computer <unk> connected with a <unk> engine and yesterday because of the weather 
 nasa said the galileo worm had nothing to do with either delay 
 mr. alexander of <unk> said <unk> have gone after span before 
 he said the chaos computer club of west germany once managed to <unk> span and do such things as change the value of <unk> <unk> up some calculations 
 it is now a <unk> that prosecutors are bringing criminal <unk> in cases where until a few years ago only a civil action at most would have been brought 
 yet it is also <unk> that the power to create new crimes belongs only to the legislature and not to courts 
 beginning in the early 19th century with u.s. v. hudson and <unk> the supreme court has repeatedly held that a judicial power to declare conduct to be against the public interest and hence criminal while well established in british law would <unk> legislative authority under the doctrine of separation of powers 
 that 's the conventional theory anyway 
 in practice however the line between interpretation and <unk> of the criminal law long ago began to <unk> 
 in particular a common law of white-collar crime has developed with surprising <unk> over the past decade 
 for example although insider trading has long been criminal it has never been <unk> defined 
 in N the supreme court tried to supply a <unk> definition in the <unk> v. sec decision which found that liability depended on whether the <unk> had <unk> his fiduciary duty to the corporation in order to obtain some personal gain and whether the <unk> knew or <unk> <unk> this fact 
 gradually however lower courts and prosecutors have pushed this definition to its breaking point 
 consider the facts underlying the N conviction of robert chestman 
 prior to a tender offer by <unk> for <unk> inc. in N the founder of the <unk> 's supermarket chain called an elderly relative to tell her to <unk> her stock certificates for delivery 
 she called her daughter to take her to the bank who in turn persuaded her husband a mr. <unk> to run this <unk> 
 hearing of this information the husband discussed it with his broker mr. chestman and mr. chestman then bought for his own account and other clients 
 basically mr. chestman was a <unk> <unk> 
 did mr. <unk> his <unk> breach a fiduciary duty and if so to whom 
 did mr. <unk> seek personal gain and if so how 
 or did mr. chestman only hear a market rumor which one may <unk> trade upon 
 the line seems <unk> thin for <unk> purposes 
 a second illustration is supplied by the recent guilty plea entered by robert freeman formerly head of arbitrage at goldman sachs & co 
 essentially mr. freeman had invested heavily in the beatrice leveraged buy-out when he was told by another prominent trader bernard bunny <unk> that the deal was in trouble 
 after placing orders to sell mr. freeman called martin <unk> an investment banker at kidder peabody & co. who was advising on the deal to confirm these rumors 
 mr. <unk> asked mr. freeman who his source was and on hearing that it was bunny <unk> responded well your bunny has a good nose 
 the illegal tip of the bunny 's good nose was then largely a confirmation of rumors already known to many in the market 
 had the case gone to trial the same issues would have surfaced 
 was there a fiduciary breach in order to obtain personal gain 
 did mr. freeman have notice of this 
 finally was the information material 
 yet all these issues are subsidiary to a more central issue who is and who should be making the criminal law here 
 it is not my <unk> that either mr. chestman or mr. freeman was an innocent victim of prosecutorial <unk> 
 <unk> both were on notice that their behavior was at least risky 
 but even if they behaved <unk> reasons still exist to fear and resist this steady process of <unk> judicial extension of the law of insider trading 
 courts and legislatures make decisions in very different ways and are each susceptible to very different kinds of errors 
 <unk> judicial examination of an actor 's conduct has always been the common law 's method 
 when only civil liability is involved this method has the <unk> strengths of <unk> <unk> and <unk> of <unk> 
 still <unk> <unk> decision making of this sort is vulnerable to the tunnel vision caused by a <unk> on ad <unk> and usually <unk> examples 
 when a court decides that a particular actor 's conduct was <unk> and so <unk> the definition of insider trading to reach this conduct it does not see the potentially enormous number of other cases that will be covered by the expanded rule 
 thus a court is poorly positioned to make judgments about the social utility of the expanded rule 
 for example in focusing on mr. freeman 's attempt to gain <unk> information about a deal 's collapse one does not naturally think about the reverse side of the coin what if the rumor had been false 
 can a security analyst call an investment banker to make certain that a seemingly <unk> rumor is in fact false 
 in the past not only would reputable professionals have rushed to check out such rumors with the company but companies listed on the major stock exchanges were encouraged by the exchanges to respond openly to such inquiries from securities analysts 
 today after mr. freeman 's plea there is an uncertainty that is both unfair and inefficient 
 in this light the <unk> advantages of legislative <unk> become clear N before it acts the legislature typically will hear the views of representatives of all those affected by its decision not just the immediate parties before the court and N the legislature can frame bright line standards that create less uncertainty than the <unk> decisions of courts 
 although legislative lines can result in <unk> which explains why the sec has long resisted a legislative definition of insider trading judicial <unk> inevitably creates uncertainty because of the <unk> outer <unk> and implications of most judicial decisions 
 at least when the stakes are high uncertainty in turn results in <unk> as individuals do not <unk> to approach an uncertain line closely 
 the federal mail and wire fraud statutes provide even better <unk> of the rapid evolution of a federal common law of white-collar crime 
 in N the supreme court attempted in <unk> v. u.s. to halt the <unk> expansion of these statutes by adopting a rule of strict construction for <unk> criminal <unk> 
 yet late last year congress effectively reversed this decision by <unk> a <unk> statute that defined fraud to include any scheme to <unk> another of the <unk> right of honest services 
 at a <unk> this may <unk> all fiduciary <unk> and possibly all <unk> by an agent or employee 
 such a statute illustrates the fundamental problem congress finds it is easier to pass <unk> <unk> <unk> which the courts must thereafter interpret than to engage in the difficult <unk> <unk> that are <unk> its responsibility 
 we are confronted less with a judicial power grab than with a legislative <unk> 
 predictably when confronted with morally dubious behavior prosecutors will exploit the <unk> such <unk> statutes give them 
 over the long run however <unk> cases will make bad law

 banks want to remain competitive said <unk> mehl chairman of banxquote 
 october is a big <unk> month and perhaps they anticipate greater demand among people leaving the stock market

 the dow has more ups and <unk> than an <unk> proclaimed an <unk> monday in new york newspapers touting lincoln savings bank 's one-year cd 
 harold jones lincoln 's chief retail banking officer said there has n't yet been a <unk> response although the ad included a coupon that could arrive later in the week 
 friday 's market rout came <unk> in the middle of the heaviest month for cd <unk> when a number of banks and thrifts already have promotions under way 
 first national bank of boston for example is offering certain new <unk> an extra quarter of a percentage point on six-month and 12-month cds 
 some banks actually boosted yields on the <unk> term cds in the latest week 
 new york 's citibank for instance increased the yield on <unk> three-month cds to N N from N N 
 on average however three-month cds at major banks are yielding a <unk> of a percentage point less than they were a week ago 
 average yields on cds aimed at individual investors fell less than half as much as yields on treasury bills sold at monday 's auction 
 six-month cds of $ N and less yielded an average N N in the week ended tuesday down from N N according to banxquote 
 the yield on six-month <unk> fell to N N on monday from N N the week before 
 meanwhile the average yield on six-month cds of more than $ N fell to N N in the latest week according to banxquote from N N the week before 
 mr. mehl noted that actual rates are almost identical on small and <unk> cds but yields on cds aimed at the individual investor are boosted by more frequent <unk> 
 cds sold by major brokerage houses which like jumbo cds tend to closely follow interest rate trends also posted larger drops in yields 
 a six-month <unk> cd for example was yielding an average N N in the latest week a fifth of a percentage point lower than the week before 
 in late april when interest rates were at their recent highs short-term cds sold by brokers were offering yields half a percentage point or more higher than banks 
 cd yields are generally expected to fall further in coming weeks 
 what happened in the stock market and the bigger trade deficit reported yesterday make it unlikely that short-term interest rates will rise any time soon said mr. mehl of banxquote 
 even before the market drop rates were down about half a percentage point said robert j. hutchinson senior vice president for retail marketing at manufacturers hanover trust co. in new york 
 that puts pressure on cd rates 
 conservatives have an important decision to make this fall 
 at the recent meetings of the world bank and international monetary fund the bush administration announced its intention to decide by <unk> the size of the next increase in the imf 's capital base 
 while the u.s. share of the increase probably will not reach the $ N billion or more implicit in the imf 's request for a doubling of its $ N billion capital the administration probably will agree to a multibillion-dollar increase 
 this would be consistent with its <unk> support for the brady plan and <unk> exchange-rate intervention and with its financial commitment to mexico poland and others 
 the imf has several reasons for <unk> the increase 
 its role in the economies of developing countries has grown steadily since the 1970s 
 the size and pace of <unk> will accelerate further under the brady plan which promises larger and earlier <unk> to approved countries 
 at least three other factors have encouraged the imf to insist on increased capital 
 first it argues that its capital base must be increased in order to maintain its size relative to world financial markets for which it feels some responsibility 
 second the world bank 's recent $ N billion capital increase $ N billion from the u.s. has left the imf feeling less than first <unk> among international financial institutions 
 third the imf would like to meet japan 's request for increased ownership currently N N 
 japan has supported a larger role for the imf in developing-country debt issues and is an important financial resource for <unk> programs in developing countries 
 while international politics may argue for the capital increase there is a clear economic case against it 
 opponents of the increase argue that the imf practices central planning while supporting <unk> governments 
 they question whether the imf has any role in developing countries given its original mandate to assist industrial countries in <unk> <unk> 
 opponents show that there are already more funds available than <unk> reform efforts 
 they worry that new imf funding of developing countries will simply end up <unk> imf debt for <unk> commercial bank debt a bad trade all around 
 they believe <unk> which addresses the problems of markets investment climate and management practices is the key to developing-country growth not the imf 's <unk> focus on trade deficits quarterly targets and government debt 
 they point at the numerous developing-country governments that have inflated taxed and regulated themselves into <unk> under <unk> imf programs 
 decisions on increases in the imf 's capital base traditionally are made by the administration with subsequent authorization by congress 
 the last u.s. congressional authorization in N was a political <unk> and carried a $ N billion housing program along with it to secure adequate votes 
 the politics of the N congressional authorization are likely to be similar to those of previous <unk> 
 liberals may support the stabilizing <unk> role of the imf on two conditions that the administration give assurances that liberal democrats ' support will not be used against them in congressional re-election campaigns and that the legislation address with dollars social and environmental concerns 
 conservative republicans will be given the choice of supporting or fighting their party 's popular president in an election year 
 a u.s. decision to refuse the imf its capital increase or limit it to N N would bring a major change in international economic policy and could not be taken <unk> 
 <unk> would <unk> over the implications for the <unk> coordination process and the stability of world financial markets 
 because commercial banks and the developing-country governments believe they will get a piece of any capital increase a <unk> imf mission would leave both feeling <unk> 
 furthermore a u.s. rejection of the capital increase and transfer of shares to japan would give japan an argument against future calls for economic <unk> 
 on the other hand a decision to increase the imf 's capital would reinforce the central economic role of <unk> institutions in developing countries 
 with the increase even more developing-country energy and talent would be diverted from creating profitable economic systems to setting up economic planning ministries that generate <unk> economic plans 
 <unk> the <unk> could slow economic development even further as countries delay <unk> steps in anticipation of richer <unk> support 
 conservatives should take a position prior to the administration 's year-end deadline 
 the issues are too important to be left to the financial and budget ministries fighting over the size of the capital increase rather than its purpose 
 if conservatives do n't support an increase in the imf 's capital then it is incumbent on them to speak up now and explain the alternative

 in a move that could pose a new competitive challenge to time warner inc. 's powerful home box office cable giant tele-communications inc. agreed to buy half of showtime networks inc. from viacom inc. for $ N million 
 the purchase comes after nearly three years of <unk> <unk> talks between tci and viacom which has also discussed the sale of an interest in showtime with other cable operators 
 showtime is a distant no. N to home box office and in may filed a $ N billion antitrust suit against time warner charging the company and its hbo and american television cable units with conspiring to <unk> the pay tv business 
 hbo has close to N million subscribers to its hbo and <unk> networks while showtime and its sister service the movie channel have only about N million according to paul <unk> associates a <unk> calif. research firm 
 for tci the investment in showtime puts it in an unusual position as the largest cable operator with control of close to N million of the nation 's N million cable subscribers tci is hbo 's largest customer 
 but tci president john <unk> has long been concerned about hbo 's dominance of the pay tv business and has been eager to keep showtime as a healthy competitor 
 it is important to the cable industry that we have a <unk> and competitive <unk> marketplace mr. <unk> said in a statement 
 in a telephone interview robert thomson tci senior vice president said showtime 's suit against hbo does n't involve us and nothing we 're doing here bears any relationship to that 
 he added we do n't intend to be drawn into it noting that tci wo n't play any active role in the management of showtime 
 linking up showtime with the largest cable operator in the u.s. could sharply boost its subscribers 
 tci said it may bring in other cable operators as investors a practice it has employed in the past with investments in other cable networks such as the discovery channel 
 additional cable partners could boost subscribers even further 
 time warner declined comment 
 in addition to owning hbo time warner owns american television & communications inc. the nation 's second largest cable operator after tci 
 viacom also owns cable systems but it is the <unk> largest operator of such systems with less than one million subscribers 
 the tci investment is a big victory for viacom 's chief executive officer frank <unk> and <unk> h. cox president of the showtime unit 
 this takes any question of showtime 's viability and puts it away once and for all mr. <unk> said in a telephone interview 
 the fight between hbo and showtime is particularly <unk> because mr. <unk> is the former chief executive of hbo and mr. cox served as chief of marketing for the service 
 they were both hired by <unk> <unk> the boston billionaire who took control of viacom three years ago in a leveraged buy-out
