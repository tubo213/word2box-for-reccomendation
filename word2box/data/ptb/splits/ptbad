 even if he is she adds he appears to have only limited room for maneuver within the communist party 's ruling politburo 
 against this background the new east german leader must move quickly to shore up his government 's standing 
 the sudden growth of the opposition movement together with the steady <unk> of citizens <unk> through poland and hungary has plunged the country into its <unk> political crisis since an <unk> workers ' <unk> in N 
 he does n't have any <unk> period says a western diplomat based in east berlin 
 but if he 's sharp and quick he has a chance 
 the diplomat adds that mr. krenz has several things going for him 
 the east german economy is strong compared with other east bloc nations 
 and his relative youth could help him project a more <unk> image <unk> with the perception of mr. honecker as an <unk> old man 
 for average east germans mr. krenz remains a <unk> 
 either he was n't being real in the past or he is n't being real right now says a <unk> east german doctor 
 either way i have a problem with how quickly he 's changed 
 the doctor was among dozens of people <unk> through east berlin 's <unk> church saturday morning 
 the walls of the church are covered with <unk> news <unk> and <unk> notes associated with the country 's political opposition 
 i have to come here to read the walls says the doctor because it 's information i still ca n't get through the newspapers 
 meanwhile east germany 's growing openness may even allow the state-controlled news media to display a <unk> sense of humor 
 television last week carried a new report on east berlin 's main <unk> factory and the need to boost production 
 east germans remember a comment a few years ago by kurt <unk> the government 's top <unk> that just because a neighbor hangs new <unk> there 's no reason to change your own 
 his point was there is no reason for east germany to copy <unk> changes 
 it 's hard to know whether it was intended to be funny says the east berlin <unk> but everyone i know <unk> about it 
 the list of laboratories claiming to be producing <unk> amounts of heat from cold fusion experiments is slowly growing 
 but the experiments continue to be plagued by lack of firm evidence that the extra heat is coming from the <unk> of <unk> atoms 
 new experiments at some of the big national laboratories are still unable to find hints of nuclear fusion reactions leaving only the finding of tritium in a texas experiment to support university of utah <unk> ' claim of <unk> <unk> fusion at room temperatures 
 the latest developments in cold fusion research were presented in N reports delivered at the fall meeting here of the <unk> society the first scientific meeting in five months to hear formal reports on cold fusion experiments 
 the meeting offered stark evidence of a dramatic fall in scientific interest in cold fusion research 
 of the N <unk> registered for the society 's <unk> meeting fewer than N sat through the day and a half of cold fusion <unk> at week 's end 
 this was in contrast with the society 's meeting last may at the <unk> of the controversy when more than N scientists along with scores of reporters and tv crews crowded into a los angeles hotel <unk> for a tumultuous special night session on the subject 
 neither of the two <unk> whose utah experiments triggered the cold fusion <unk> martin fleischmann and b. stanley pons were at the meeting 
 but some members of an ad <unk> expert committee set up by the department of energy to evaluate the cold fusion research were in the audience 
 the committee is to recommend at the end of the month whether <unk> should support cold fusion research 
 most of the two dozen scientists taking the <unk> reported results with new more sophisticated variations of the seemingly simple <unk> experiments described last march by messrs. fleischmann and pons 
 the experiments involve <unk> a thin rod of palladium metal with a wire of platinum and plunging the two <unk> into heavy water in which the <unk> atoms are a <unk> heavy form known as <unk> 
 when an electric current is applied to the palladium and platinum <unk> the heavy water did begin to break up or <unk> 
 ordinarily the <unk> or breakup of the water would consume almost all of the electrical energy 
 but messrs. fleischmann and pons said their experiments also produced large amounts of heat 
 the heat energy plus the energy consumed by the breakup of the water <unk> added to far more energy coming out of the <unk> than electrical energy going in they reported 
 because they also detected tritium and indications of nuclear radiation they asserted that the excess heat energy must be coming from energy released by the nuclear fusion of <unk> atoms inside the palladium rod 
 as of last weekend a dozen labs also have reported measuring excess heat from similar <unk> experiments although amounts of such heat vary widely 
 one of the seven reports presented here of excess heat production was given by richard a. <unk> professor of chemical engineering at the university of minnesota 
 mr. <unk> said his skepticism of the utah claims was initially confirmed when his first experiments last spring failed to produce results 
 but he then borrowed a palladium rod from <unk> at texas <unk> who said they were getting excess heat 
 the results were <unk> he said 
 on the fourth run with the borrowed rod the experiment began producing excess heat 
 the experiment was stopped briefly to change an instrument 
 when it was <unk> heat output really took off and produced excess heat for several hours before dying down he said 
 typical of other experiments mr. <unk> said his experiment was very <unk> 
 it would go along doing nothing but <unk> the heavy water and then at totally <unk> times it would begin producing excess heat for as long as N or N hours before <unk> down 
 the excess heat was N N to N N more than the energy involved in the <unk> of water 
 mr. <unk> said the heat bursts were too large and too long to be explained by the sudden release of energy that might have slowly accumulated during the experiments ' <unk> times as some scientists have suggested 
 there is a reality to the excess energy he said 
 other scientists said they also were getting sporadic bursts of excess heat lasting several hours at a time 
 the bursts often occur they said after they <unk> the experiments by raising or lowering the amount of electric current being applied or switching the current off and on 
 one <unk> privately suggested this hinted that some <unk> chemical reactions might be producing the heat 
 one reason questions <unk> the heat experiments is that they involve unusually <unk> measurements 
 typically the input energy ranges from a third of a <unk> to one <unk> and the excess energy is measured in <unk> of a <unk> 
 one exception is a continuing experiment at stanford university where as much as N watts of energy are being put into the <unk> cells 
 a cell filled with heavy water is producing N to N watts more heat than an identical <unk> cell filled with ordinary water next to it reported <unk> m. <unk> an associate of materials scientist robert a. <unk> head of the stanford experimental team 
 one of the few hints the excess heat might be produced by fusion came from brief remarks by <unk> john <unk> of texas <unk> university 
 mr. <unk> previously reported getting bursts of excess heat and of <unk> increasing amounts of tritium forming in the heavy water 
 he said that within the past few days he 's gotten evidence that there is a weak <unk> between the time the heat bursts occur and the production of tritium 
 there is n't any way to <unk> measure the amount of tritium in the heavy water so it 's been difficult to tell whether the tritium formation is related to the heat bursts or some other phenomenon 
 increasingly careful attempts to measure neutrons which would be strong evidence of fusion reactions continue to be negative 
 messrs. fleischmann and pons initially reported indirect evidence of neutrons being produced in their experiment but later conceded the measurements were questionable 
 researchers at <unk> national laboratories in <unk> n.m. reported they went so far as to take a cold fusion experiment and three <unk> detectors into a tunnel under N feet of <unk> to shield the detectors from <unk> <unk> 
 a number of times they detected neutrons in one sometimes two of the three detectors but only once during N hours of the experiment did they detect a <unk> burst in all three detectors and they think that was a <unk> event 
 <unk> <unk> of los <unk> national laboratory said researchers there detected a burst of neutrons from an early cold fusion experiment last april but decided not to announce it until they could confirm it 
 in subsequent experiments one of two <unk> detectors occasionally indicated a burst of neutrons but <unk> bursts were never recorded in both detectors at the same time 
 they concluded the indications of neutrons stemmed from <unk> in the detectors rather than from the cold fusion experiment 
 at the lawrence berkeley laboratory in california new experiments indicated that the <unk> added to the heavy water so it will conduct a current can produce previously <unk> electrical effects on the surface of the palladium rod which messrs. fleischmann and pons might have <unk> reported philip ross from the california laboratory 
 dow jones & co. announced wall street journal advertising rates for N 
 the rates which take effect jan. N include a N N increase for national edition advertising 
 the journal also will offer expanded volume and frequency discounts 
 the increase for national edition advertising is less than the inflation rate and compares with a N N increase in N 
 newsprint and <unk> prices this year have not gone up said peter r. <unk> president of dow jones 
 we have invested in improved editorial quality and expanded our quality audience without substantially increasing our costs 
 fundamental fairness and a sense of responsibility lead us to share operating <unk> with our customers 
 advertising rates for the eastern midwest western and southwest editions will increase an average N N and rates for <unk> advertising editions will increase N N 
 rates for the wall street journal reports will remain unchanged 
 a one-time <unk> <unk> <unk> in the wall street journal national edition will cost $ N 
 advertising rates for the wall street <unk> published in brussels and printed in the netherlands and switzerland will increase N N 
 rates for the asian wall street journal published and printed in hong kong and also printed in singapore and tokyo will rise N N 
 rates for the asian wall street journal weekly published in new york for north american readers will rise N N 
 dow jones also publishes barron 's magazine other <unk> and community newspapers and operates electronic business information services 
 it owns N N of telerate inc. a leading supplier of computerized financial information on global markets 
 reflecting the impact of lower semiconductor prices and cuts in defense spending texas instruments inc. said third-quarter net income fell N N and sales dropped slightly from a year earlier 
 net fell to $ N million or N cents a common share from $ N million or $ N a share a year ago 
 sales fell N N to $ N billion from $ N billion 
 for the nine months the electronics and defense concern had net of $ N million or $ N a share down N N from $ N million or $ N a share in the year-ago period 
 sales were $ N billion up N N from $ N billion 
 jerry <unk> chairman president and chief executive officer said sluggish <unk> sales reduced demand for semiconductors 
 that coupled with lower semiconductor prices and higher <unk> expense contributed to the decline in sales and profit 
 in addition cost increases related to fixed-price defense contracts and a $ N million charge to reduce the work force of texas instruments ' <unk> division also reduced net 
 however the quarter results included $ N million in royalty income from patent licenses up from $ N million in the year-earlier period 
 the nine months include $ N million of royalty income up from $ N million last year 
 mr. <unk> was n't optimistic about the short-term outlook <unk> that further <unk> reductions may be needed 
 we expect near-term <unk> in the electronics market he said and we will take ongoing <unk> actions as necessary to keep operations aligned with demand 
 further he said an internal reorganization to combine several divisions into the information technology group is expected to affect fourth-quarter results by an undisclosed amount 
 lynch corp. said its lynch telephone corp. subsidiary completed the acquisition of western new mexico telephone co. for $ N million plus assumption of $ N million of debt 
 western new mexico telephone silver city had net income of $ N million on revenue of about $ N million last year 
 it is an independent phone company with a service area of N square miles in southwest new mexico 
 it is also a partner in the <unk> cellular franchise covering most of western new mexico 
 the transaction represents lynch 's entry into the telephone business 
 the company which has interests in television trucking services and <unk> and <unk> equipment said it plans to make other acquisitions in the telephone industry 
 nelson <unk> hunt 's attempted corner on silver a decade ago is still <unk> the market in this metal 
 silver now trading around $ N an ounce surged to an <unk> peak of $ N an ounce in january N from around $ N in <unk> 
 mr. hunt 's attempt to squeeze the silver market N years ago is still indirectly to blame for today 's market depression says <unk> edgar managing director of <unk> <unk> ltd. london bullion brokers 
 while some N million ounces of silver once held by mr. hunt and middle eastern associates are n't hanging over the market anymore the price surge of N <unk> an expansion of mine production and scrap recovery and encouraged silver consumers to <unk> on silver use mr. edgar says 
 photographic developers for example bought equipment to recover silver from spent photographs <unk> and processing solutions 
 meanwhile the photographic industry which accounts for N N of silver consumption continues to look for <unk> 
 japanese and u.s. photographic firms are beginning to produce electronic cameras and <unk> that do n't require silver dealers say 
 silver 's history of volatility is also discouraging investors dealers say 
 even in the present uncertain investment climate investors are <unk> quality assets such as treasury bills and bonds to gold silver and platinum dealers say 
 although prices rallied briefly following the tumble on world stock markets earlier this month and the related decline of the dollar precious metals are out of favor for the moment because of high interest rates and a determination by industrial nations to curb inflation dealers say 
 silver however is in a deeper slump than are gold and platinum 
 some analysts contend that silver is cheap now that prices are <unk> at levels last seen in the mid-1970s 
 bargain <unk> believe that silver offers the best value <unk> precious metals says frederick r. demler analyst at drexel burnham lambert inc 
 a further decline in prices will lead to mine production cuts in the u.s. he says 
 scrap merchants are converting smaller quantities of metal into silver while low prices are discouraging exports from india and the soviet union 
 silver prices could also be boosted by strikes in leading producing nations peru and mexico mr. demler says 
 meanwhile total fabrication demand for silver has risen six years in a row he says 
 japanese demand grew by N N in the first half of this year and the nation plans an issue of a silver <unk> coin that will require N million ounces 
 compared with huge annual surpluses of more than N million ounces in the first half of the 1980s world silver supplies and consumption are now nearly in balance mr. demler says 
 despite <unk> rallies in the past few years improvements in the <unk> balance have n't managed to push silver prices into a higher range 
 there 's just too much silver around says tom butler an analyst at samuel <unk> & co. a london bullion house 
 a huge silver <unk> at exchanges refiners <unk> industries and government warehouses of at least N million ounces is the market <unk> says shearson lehman hutton inc. in a report 
 this year alone inventories at the commodity exchange of new york jumped by a staggering N million to N million ounces because of producer deliveries <unk> by <unk> and sales by <unk> investors says <unk> o'connell london-based precious metals analyst at shearson lehman hutton 
 silver production is also in an <unk> upward trend ms. o'connell says 
 moreover while asian and middle eastern investors <unk> gold and help <unk> its price silver does n't have the same <unk> dealers say 
 investors have gotten burned on silver so often that they are far more partial to gold says <unk> <unk> senior vice president at union bank of switzerland 
 yet if gold prices improve silver prices could rally sharply he says 
 however dealers caution that any increase would be $ N to $ N at most

 livestock and <unk> 
 analysts expect the prices of live cattle futures contracts to rise in trading today in the wake of a government quarterly census that found <unk> cattle on feedlots 
 after the close of trading friday the agriculture department reported that feedlots in the N biggest ranch states held N million cattle on oct. N down N N from that date a year earlier 
 most analysts had expected the government to report a N N decline 
 feedlots <unk> young cattle for <unk> so a decline signals a tightening supply of beef 
 the government reported that the number of young cattle placed on feedlots during the quarter dropped N N compared with the year-earlier quarter 
 many industry analysts had been projecting a N N decline in <unk> for the quarter 
 in the N quarter many farmers were forced to sell their cattle to <unk> operators because the drought <unk> out the <unk> on their <unk> 
 the number of cattle moving onto feedlots in the recent quarter was also lower because <unk> cattle is less profitable 
 a shortage of young cattle has made them more expensive for <unk> operators to buy 
 the agriculture department also said that the number of <unk> cattle <unk> in the quarter dropped by N N from the N quarter which was in line with projections by analysts 
 energy 
 friday 's <unk> price drop to $ N in the <unk> november contract for west texas intermediate crude may well set the tone for trading this week in petroleum futures on the new york mercantile exchange 
 most traders and analysts attributed the decline to technical factors associated with the contract 's going off the board 
 others said that the drop continued the downward correction that 's been due in the petroleum pits and that such a trend could well continue in the next several trading sessions 
 barring any <unk> news events trading in the days ahead should further test recent projections by oil economists and other market watchers that strong fourth-quarter demand will keep prices firm 
 copper 
 copper prices fell sharply friday afternoon 
 for example copper for december delivery settled N cents lower at $ N a pound 
 pressure came from several developments including the settlement of two long-term strikes 
 on friday one analyst said <unk> workers ratified a new labor agreement ending a three-month strike at the highland valley mine in british columbia 
 in mexico the analyst added employees at the cananea mine who have been out of work since late august when the mine was declared bankrupt by the government accepted a N N cut in the <unk> work force 
 the mine is expected to return to production in about a week 
 on friday selling dominated the afternoon curb session in london which takes place at noon edt 
 the premium of cash copper to the three-month forward offerings narrowed indicating weaker demand for cash copper 
 long-term support for the december contract was believed to be at $ N a pound 
 a technical analyst said there were a number of stop-loss orders under that level that were touched off when the contract 's price fell below it 
 that brought in considerable fund selling which continued until the close of trading 
 in general it was a bearish close said ben <unk> a copper trader at rudolph <unk> & co. a major commodities trading and brokerage firm 
 but whether this price break has implications for this week he said we will know more when the london metal exchange copper stock levels are released monday morning 
 another analyst said he expected <unk> inventories to be down by about N tons when the weekly report is issued 
 bernard savaiko senior commodities analyst at painewebber inc. said that when traders saw the market was n't reacting <unk> to the forecasts of lower <unk> stocks they perceived a bearish sign 
 he also noted that the japanese who had been buying at prices just above the $ N level apparently pulled back from the market on friday 
 mr. savaiko said he sees a possibility of the december contract dropping to $ N a pound 
 hewlett-packard co. will announce today a software program that allows computers in a network to speed up computing tasks by sending the tasks to each other 
 called task broker the program acts something like an <unk> among a group of computers <unk> together 
 if a machine has a big computing task task broker asks other computers in the network for bids on the job 
 it then <unk> which machine is free to do the task most quickly and sends the task to that machine 
 hewlett-packard claims that the software allows a network to run three times as many tasks as conventional networks and will run each task twice as fast 
 the new hewlett-packard program said analyst john <unk> at <unk> research inc. a <unk> research company is a key building block as people move to this new model of distributed processing 
 in today 's computer networks some machines often sit idle while others are <unk> 
 with the hewlett-packard program he said you get more bang for the buck you 've spent on computers 
 the program which will be shipped in january N runs on the unix operating system 
 hewlett-packard will charge $ N for a license covering N users 
 the program now works on all hewlett-packard and <unk> workstations and on computers made by <unk> computer inc. of <unk> conn 
 hewlett-packard said it will sell versions later next year that run on sun microsystems inc. and digital equipment corp. machines 
 the task broker <unk> from other programs that spread computing tasks around a network 
 a previously available program called network computing system developed by hewlett-packard 's <unk> division for instance takes a task and <unk> it up into parts <unk> up those parts to several computers in a network for simultaneous processing 
 but programs in individual computers must be revised in order to work with that system 
 applications wo n't have to be <unk> to work with task broker hewlett-packard said and the user of a computer wo n't be able to tell that another machine is doing the work 
 the task broker turns that network into as far as the user is concerned one giant computer said bill <unk> general manager of hewlett-packard 's workstation group 
 price wars between the fast-food giants are starting to <unk> the fast-food little guys the franchisees 
 when <unk> start fighting <unk> get killed says murray <unk> <unk> of national restaurants a new york franchisee for pizza hut roy rogers and other chains 
 as <unk> and pizza outlets <unk> one area after another franchisers are struggling desperately for market share slashing prices and stepping up costly promotions 
 the fight is putting a tight squeeze on profits of many threatening to drive the smallest ones out of business and <unk> relations between the national fast-food chains and their franchisees 
 the chains used to offer discounts during winter when business was slow but in the last year or so discounting has become a 12-month thing says donald <unk> president of <unk> group inc. a new york franchisee of grand metropolitan plc 's burger king chain 
 though <unk> 's sales are up slightly this year mr. <unk> says profits will be flat or lower 
 and bill <unk> a <unk> ariz. <unk> of mcdonald 's corp. who is chairman of the company 's national operators advisory board says some fast-food outlets could be in serious trouble based on the amount of discounting that seems to be going on 
 until recently the huge fast-food industry with sales of about $ N billion last year kept <unk> to a minimum 
 but early this year pepsico inc. 's <unk> bell unit and wendy 's international inc. slashed prices and stepped up promotions says john <unk> an analyst for wertheim schroder & co 
 that brought a chain reaction in the industry 
 the situation was further <unk> early this month when mcdonald 's set plans to heat up the discounting by offering coupons 
 it also decided to go national with pizza which it has been <unk> 
 now <unk> deals on pizza are common so are <unk> <unk> on <unk> normally priced twice as high 
 the discounting say fast-food operators occurs on a scale and with a frequency they have n't seen before 
 the result is that some franchisees are running hard just to stay even laying off middle managers and working harder to make less 
 joe mack a district manager for <unk> enterprises inc. a burger king operator in omaha neb. says discounting is so <unk> that we have to serve N N to N N more customers to keep sales level 
 it 's almost as if you 're doing extra work to give away the food he says 
 alan <unk> president of <unk> 's inc. an operator of arby 's restaurants in omaha says all we 're doing is keeping the customers coming but we are n't increasing sales 
 with fast-food outlets on every corner he like many does n't think he has a choice in the price war our customers say that they wo n't go into a fast-food store unless they get a coupon 
 if the battle continues much longer many fast-food businesses will close or merge predicts vincent <unk> who owns a string of kentucky fried chicken stores in the midwest 
 the industry is overbuilt he says 
 fast-food franchisers have managed to squeeze in stores into every corner available 
 the national restaurant association says <unk> restaurant units in the u.s. rose N N to N between N and N the last year for which figures are available 
 with the market so crowded says a spokesman for wendy 's in columbus ohio if you 're doing well you 're doing well at someone else 's expense 
 simply put there is n't enough business for every store to grow 
 according to mr. <unk> inflation-adjusted <unk> sales at company-owned wendy 's units in the u.s. have trailed year-earlier levels throughout N except for august 
 mcdonald 's has also been running negative all year the analyst says 
 spokesmen for wendy 's and mcdonald 's criticized mr. <unk> 's calculations 
 jack greenberg executive vice president and chief financial officer of mcdonald 's says the company does n't <unk> much less disclose inflation-adjusted <unk> sales 
 he adds that short-term comparisons can be very misleading because of differences in timing of marketing programs from year to year 
 profit margins at company-owned mcdonald 's outlets in the u.s. are holding up quite <unk> says mr. greenberg 
 profits of franchisees have n't been higher since the mid-1970s he adds 
 but mr. greenberg 's <unk> outlook is n't matched by many fast-food industry observers 
 smaller chains and <unk> operators will be the first to fail many in the industry predict 
 big franchise groups can ride out the storm a lot longer says mr. <unk> the burger king operator in new york 
 the prolonged price pressures are driving a wedge between some franchisers and their franchisees 
 mr. <unk> the kentucky fried chicken franchisee notes that most franchise owners must absorb increases in expenses without any cut in the royalties or portion of sales that they must pay franchisers 
 franchisees ca n't be forced to go along with a <unk> 's discounting 
 but once a franchisee agrees to a promotional program the <unk> can demand full participation to the very end says <unk> <unk> a principal of <unk> & <unk> a chicago law firm with franchise industry clients 
 he says courts have held that antitrust considerations are <unk> in such cases by the need to protect consumers from deceptive marketing 
 in any case many franchisees in order to stay on good terms with franchisers routinely go along with promotions 
 says mr. <unk> of national restaurants if you resisted on prices maybe you would never get that telephone call about a new franchise

 <unk> jackson the retired baseball star has found another use for them 
 mr. jackson who won the <unk> mr. october for his world series <unk> is selling some of his canceled checks to <unk> collectors through a dealer for as much as $ N each 
 dealers say the <unk> trade in mr. jackson 's canceled checks is unusual 
 i do n't know of any living <unk> that 's ever done it says jack <unk> a dealer in <unk> iowa and a recognized expert in the field of baseball <unk> 
 an initial batch of mr. jackson 's checks was on sale at a <unk> show held in san francisco over labor day weekend 
 mr. jackson showed up at the affair to sign <unk> for a fee as well 
 for someone who has everything else <unk> 's jersey cap and cards his checks might be a nice addition says william <unk> owner of bill 's sports <unk> in denver who examined the checks at the san francisco card show 
 for years the canceled checks of a small number of well-known baseball players have been bought and sold 
 but these players were dead 
 maybe three years ago there were a lot of <unk> <unk> in the <unk> and <unk> back there were <unk> ruth checks says mr. <unk> 
 however the thought of a living player selling his checks <unk> some people the wrong way

 who knows how much they 'll be worth N years from now 
 and mr. <unk> does n't believe they 're worth all that much now 
 i do n't think the checks are worth $ N apiece he says 
 why mr. jackson who could n't be reached for comment has made some of his checks available for sale is n't clear 
 he probably has n't done it for the cash 
 i would say he 's definitely not in need of money says <unk> <unk> an agent of mr. jackson 's based in new york 
 he has good investments 
 and mr. jackson probably has opened new checking accounts too 
 or at least he should 
 i assume those accounts are closed says mr. <unk> referring to the accounts of the canceled checks 
 i do n't think he 'd want to give out his current account numbers 
 usx corp. and its japanese partner kobe steel ltd. agreed to form a joint venture to build a new plant to produce hot-dipped galvanized sheet products mainly for the automotive market 
 terms were n't disclosed for the plant which will have annual capacity of N tons 
 the move by the nation 's largest steelmaker follows a string of earlier announcements by other major steel companies 
 bethlehem steel corp. ltv corp. and armco inc. all have plans to build additional lines for such coated <unk> steel 
 the surge in production analysts say raises questions about capacity <unk> demand 
 they note that most of the new plants will come on line in N when the current import trade restraint program ends which could result in more imports 
 there 's too much capacity contended charles bradford an analyst with merrill lynch capital markets 
 i do n't think there 's anyone not building one 
 he does add however that <unk> japanese car makers are boosting the levels of <unk> steel in their autos instead of relying heavily on imported steel 
 that trend could increase demand for hot-dipped galvanized sheet 
 the hot-dipped galvanized segment is one of the fastest-growing and most profitable segments of the steel market <unk> by all major integrated steelmakers wanting to maintain an edge over smaller minimills and <unk> mills those spun off to employees 
 indeed usx said it expects the market for coated sheet steel to reach N million tons annually by N compared with N million tons shipped in N 
 for the first eight months of N analysts say shipments of hot-dipped galvanized steel increased about N N from a year earlier while overall steel shipments were up only N N 
 usx and kobe steel hope to reach a definitive agreement establishing the N partnership by the end of the year with construction tentatively slated for the spring of N and production by N 
 usx already has six lines in existing plants producing hot-dipped galvanized steel but this marks the first so-called <unk> plant for such production 
 moreover it will boost by N N usx 's current hot-dipped capacity of N tons 
 the company said it does n't expect the new line 's capacity to <unk> affect the company 's existing hot-dipped <unk> lines 
 steelmakers have also been adding capacity of so-called <unk> steel which is another way to make coated <unk> steel 
 one of the advantages of the hot-dipped process is that it allows the steel to be covered with a <unk> <unk> of <unk> more quickly 
 once you make up your mind about an investment the rest is easy right 
 you just call your broker and say buy or sell 
 dream on 
 there are all sorts of ways to give buy and sell instructions to a broker and just as many ways to get burned if you do n't know what you 're doing 
 so here 's a <unk> of the most common types of market orders permitted by the stock and commodity exchanges 
 two things to keep in mind not all exchanges accept every type of order 
 and even when a specific order is acceptable to an exchange a brokerage firm can refuse to enter it for a customer 
 market order this is probably the most widely used order and the one most open to abuse by unscrupulous floor brokers since it imposes no price restrictions 
 with a market order an investor tells a broker to buy or sell at the market 
 it 's like saying get me in now or get me out now 
 for example if wheat is being offered at $ N and bid at $ N a market order to buy would be filled at the higher price and a market order to sell at the lower price 
 a recent indictment alleges that some floor brokers at the two largest chicago commodity exchanges used market orders to fill customers ' orders at unfavorable prices by arranging trades with fellow brokers 
 profits realized from these trades would then be shared by the conspiring brokers 
 limit order limit orders are used when investors want to restrict the amount they will receive or pay for an investment 
 investors do this by <unk> a minimum price at which the investment may be sold or the maximum price that may be paid for it 
 <unk> an investor wants to sell a stock but not for less than $ N 
 a limit order to sell could be entered at that price 
 one risk investors may regret the restriction if the stock reaches N and then falls 
 unless the market goes at least one <unk> the smallest price <unk> permitted beyond the limit price investors are n't assured of having their orders filled because there may not be sufficient trading volume to permit filling it at the specified price 
 stop order stop orders tell a floor broker to buy or sell an investment once the price reaches a certain level 
 once the price reaches that level a stop order turns into a market order and the order is filled at whatever price the broker can get 
 stop orders are sometimes called stop-loss orders because they are frequently used to protect profits or limit losses 
 while stop orders sound similar to limit orders there is a difference sell stops must be entered at a price below the current market price and buy stops above 
 in contrast sell limit orders must be placed above the market price and buy limit orders are placed below 
 the crash in october N and last friday 's sell-off painfully taught some investors exactly what stop orders will and wo n't do 
 an investor who may have placed a stop-loss order at $ N under a stock that was trading at $ N a share on the friday before the crash was stunned to discover that the order was filled at $ N when the stock opened at that price on monday 
 <unk> order <unk> orders turn into limit orders when an investment trades at the price specified in the order 
 unlike stop orders which are filled at the market price when the stop price is hit <unk> orders demand that the trades be made only at the specified price 
 if it ca n't be made at that price it does n't get filled 
 investors who wish to be out of a position without the risk of receiving a <unk> price from a market order may use this type of order to specify the price at which the order must be filled 
 but if the market moves quickly enough it may be impossible for the broker to carry out the order because the investment has passed the specified price 
 <unk> order <unk> orders are like stop orders in that they become market orders if a specified price is reached 
 however unlike a <unk> order a buy <unk> order is entered at a price below the current price while a sell <unk> order is entered at a price above it 
 as soon as the market trades at the specified price the floor broker will fill it at the best possible price 
 <unk> order the <unk> order is one of several associated with the timing of trades 
 it <unk> a broker to buy or sell an investment at the specified price or better 
 but if the investment ca n't be bought or sold immediately the order is automatically canceled 
 gregory <unk> who came in second in the stock division of the recently completed u.s. trading championship says he uses <unk> orders almost exclusively when trading options 
 i like to use them to feel out the market he says 
 if they do n't fill it immediately then i can start over at a new price or try again with the same price 
 <unk> order this is another timing order 
 it is a market order that allows floor brokers to take more time to buy or sell an investment if they think they can get a better price by waiting 
 <unk> orders which are also known as <unk> the tape orders are always done at the customer 's risk 
 <unk> order this is really two orders in one generally for the same security or commodity <unk> floor brokers to fill whichever order they can first and then cancel the other order 
 in a <unk> market it prevents an investor from getting stuck with having made two trades on the same security 
 <unk> order this type of order couples many of the orders described above with instructions that the order must be carried out at or by a certain time 
 on the close can be added to many types of orders 
 for example <unk> orders must be filled during the last few minutes of trading for the day at a price that is within the official closing range of prices as determined by the exchange 
 <unk> orders are stop orders that only become active during the closing minutes of trading 
 day orders expire at the end of the day on which they are entered <unk> orders have no expiration date 
 most brokers assume that all orders are day orders unless specified otherwise 
 on oct. N N some investors learned the consequences of entering <unk> limit orders and then <unk> about them 
 they found they had bought stock from limit orders that they might have entered weeks or months earlier and had forgotten to cancel 
 it is always the responsibility of investors to keep track of the orders they have placed 
 investors who change their mind about buying or selling after an order has been filled are usually stuck with the consequences 
 mr. <unk> writes on the options and commodities markets for the wall street journal 
 in <unk> up the risks of stock-market investments there 's probably no starting place better than beta 
 but investors better not ignore its limitations either 
 beta is a handy gauge that measures the volatility of a stock or stock mutual fund 
 for any given move in the overall market it suggests how <unk> that particular issue might rise or fall 
 beta figures are widely available and easy to interpret 
 the beta of the broad market typically defined as the standard & poor 's 500-stock index is always N 
 so a stock with a beta of N is half as volatile one at N is N N more volatile and so on 
 cautious investors should generally go with stocks that have low <unk> 
 go with <unk> stocks to get the biggest <unk> from a bet on a bull market 
 remember though that beta also has important limitations 
 beta is only part of the risk in a stock says william f. <unk> the stanford university <unk> professor who developed the measure 
 there is risk that is not associated with market moves and the beta does n't tell you the magnitude of that 
 in particular beta does n't measure the company and <unk> risk associated with an individual stock 
 that business risk is very significant for an investor with only a few stocks but it virtually disappears in a large and <unk> portfolio 
 beta is also a poor indicator of the risk in stock groups that march to their own <unk> 
 in particular the prices of gold and other <unk> stocks shoot up and down but the stocks tend to have low <unk> because their moves are not <unk> 
 concern that investors could <unk> such <unk> led the american association of individual investors to eliminate beta figures for <unk> funds in the N edition of its mutual-fund guide 
 our fear was people would look just at the beta of a gold fund and say here is an investment with very low risk says john <unk> director of research for the chicago-based group 
 in reality it 's very volatile but the movements are not because of market movements 
 ready to review the <unk> of your investment portfolio 
 first a pop <unk> 
 when you think of the words risk and investment what 's the specific <unk> that comes to mind 
 pencils down 
 if you 're like most people you said it 's a holding that goes completely sour maybe a bond that defaults or a stock whose value disappears in a bankruptcy proceeding 
 people tend to see risk primarily on that one <unk> says timothy <unk> national director of personal financial planning for accountants deloitte haskins & sells 
 but <unk> lies another aspect of investment risk the hazard of shaping your portfolio to avoid one or more types of risk and being <unk> by others 
 this is clearly not good news to all you people who sleep like <unk> every night <unk> by <unk> of your money sitting <unk> in six-month cds 
 risk wears many <unk> and investments that are low in one type of obvious risk can be <unk> high in other less obvious kinds 
 u.s. treasury bonds for example are <unk> when it comes to returning money at maturity 
 but their value as investments can be <unk> by inflation which <unk> the purchasing power of bonds ' <unk> interest payments 
 risk is also a function of time 
 when financial professionals measure risk <unk> they usually focus on the volatility of short-term returns 
 stocks are much riskier than treasury bills for example because the range in performance from the best years to the worst is much wider 
 that is usually measured by the standard deviation or divergence of annual results from the average return over time 
 but investors who are <unk> with short-term fluctuations may be paying too little attention to another big risk not generating enough money to meet long-term financial and <unk> goals 
 for instance some investors have sworn off stocks since the N market crash last friday 's debacle only reinforced those feelings 
 but the stock market despite some <unk> declines has far outperformed other securities over extended periods 
 by retreating to the apparent security of say money-market funds investors may not be earning enough investment return to pay for a comfortable retirement 
 that 's the biggest risk of all the risk of not meeting your objectives says steven b. <unk> a new york financial planner with seidman financial services 
 as a result financial advisers say they take several steps when evaluating the <unk> of clients ' portfolios 
 they estimate the return a person 's current portfolio is likely to generate over time along with a standard deviation that suggests how much the return will vary year by year 
 they try to figure out the long-term results the person needs to meet major goals 
 and they <unk> types of risk that are not easily <unk> 
 the portfolios of two hypothetical families one a couple at retirement age and another a <unk> couple at age N illustrate several types of risk that investors need to consider 
 for instance the insured municipal bonds that dominate the older couple 's portfolio were probably selected in large part for their low repayment risk 
 but they <unk> the holders to a lot of inflation risk and interest-rate risk 
 the younger couple 's <unk> involve more risk than a diversified stock portfolio because the bulk of the money is in a single issue 
 note that the younger couple 's portfolio has a higher expected annual return N N vs. N N as calculated by seidman financial services which is the <unk> affiliate of <unk> seidman 
 that largely reflects the heavy <unk> 
 but one price paid for the higher expected return is greater short-term volatility as reflected in the higher standard deviation that seidman estimates for the younger couple 's portfolio 
 here 's how to interpret a standard deviation figure take the expected return and add one standard deviation to it 
 then take the expected return and <unk> one standard deviation 
 in two of three years the actual result should fall within that range if all the assumptions were accurate 
 then add and <unk> two standard <unk> to get a wider range 
 there 's a N N probability any year 's result will fall in the range 
 of course the greater volatility of the younger couple 's portfolio does n't necessarily mean those investments are riskier in terms of meeting the holders ' long-term goals 
 indeed the older couple 's portfolio could actually be riskier in that sense if the expected return wo n't generate enough dollars to meet their spending plans 
 they may feel <unk> secure now because they are not heavily in the stock market says john h. <unk> a financial planner with <unk> armstrong <unk> inc. in washington 
 but they may pay a price N or N years in the future 
 ms. <unk> reports on personal finance from the wall street journal 's new york bureau 
 when it comes to investing trying to weigh risk and reward can seem like throwing <unk> <unk> investors do n't know the actual returns that securities will deliver or the ups and <unk> that will occur along the way 
 looking to the past can provide some clues 
 over several decades for instance investors who put up with the stock market 's gyrations earned returns far in excess of those on bonds and cash investments like treasury bills 
 but while history can suggest what is reasonable to expect there 's no guarantee that the past will repeat itself 
 for instance some analysts believe bond returns and volatility have moved permanently closer to those of the stock market 
 and returns on cash investments may continue to exceed inflation by a wider margin than they did over the long-term past

 a letter from senator john kerry <unk> us today for <unk> that he had <unk> on manuel noriega 
 he <unk> says he has been down on noriega for some time hence his criticism of administration <unk> of the attempted coup 
 our october N editorial should have been more precise 
 it meant to convey our hope that the senator and other members of the congressional left are <unk> their dislike of noriega to include other notorious central american drug <unk> 
 the sandinistas of nicaragua for example also are part of the <unk> <unk> <unk> 
 in his letter and on the basis of his losing vote tuesday against u.s. aid for the nicaraguan opposition senator kerry makes clear he has not made that intellectual leap 
 we were wrong 
 throughout the 1980s investors have been looking for creative alternatives to traditional <unk> of financial planning 
 capital has been <unk> and people want in 
 too often however small investors are left with the same <unk> solutions that appealed to previous generations of fiduciary strategists 
 now a startling new approach is available to building your financial portfolio without <unk> risk without extensive planning and without hurting your life style one bit 
 this is particularly good news for those who hate risk who are <unk> of doing extensive amounts of planning and who refuse to see their life styles hurt in any way 
 you know who you are 
 my revolutionary system is also useful for those who have tried <unk> forms of growing their currency cushion 
 like all americans seeking <unk> prosperity i do find it necessary to plunge certain funds into conservative monetary tools if only to <unk> my <unk> who believes in such things 
 so throughout the decade i have maintained my share of individual retirement accounts and cds and <unk> with stocks bonds and mutual funds as well as preserving my necessary position in the residential real-estate market 
 return on this fine portfolio has been modest when it has not been negative 
 figure N demonstrates the performance of those businesses i 've invested in during this <unk> decade see accompanying illustration wsj oct. N N 
 <unk> properties suffered a huge decline until i <unk> myself of all such stocks in N at which point the industry while not lighting up any christmas trees began a slow recovery 
 likewise mutual funds remained relatively flat until i made what was for me a serious investment 
 by N these properties were in a tailspin causing my broker at <unk> to remark that she 'd never seen anything like it 
 concerned for her state of mind i dropped them and the market instantly began its steady climb back to health 
 perhaps most dramatic was the performance of the metropolitan new york real-estate market which was booming until i entered it in late N at which time it posted the first negative compound annual growth rate in years 
 <unk> i cast around for a different way to plan my asset distribution and with hardly any heavy breathing the answer struck me i was doing it already 
 we 've all got money to spend some of it clearly disposable since we keep <unk> of it 
 bank it 
 not really 
 <unk> it away in long-term instruments 
 nonsense 
 daily living is the best possible investment 
 your priorities may be different but here in figure N is where i 've chosen to build for the future personal space automotive <unk> children 's toys <unk> equipment <unk> and <unk> and finally entertainment perhaps the best investment of all 
 all have paid off for me in double-digit annual growth and continue to provide significant potential 
 at least according to my calculations 
 personal space figure N has grown N N annually over the course of the decade a performance that would compare <unk> with an investment in say <unk> products for the <unk> of <unk> vehicles which my <unk> got into and sort of regrets to this day 
 the <unk> of expensive children 's toys that i have purchased <unk> at a host of <unk> brokerage firms figure N has increased <unk> in total asset value far beyond any personal investment except perhaps for my record collection whose worth i think it 's safe to say is <unk> 
 continued investment in my N <unk> has been part of my strategy figure N with present annual contributions now equaling more than N N of the car 's original value 
 according to my calculations these outlays should have brought the value of my sedan to more than $ N on the open market figure N where i plan to offer it shortly 
 expansion of my living space has produced an obvious need for maintenance and construction of suitable <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> to its suburban <unk> 
 i have thus committed sufficient personal <unk> to ensure that my grounds and <unk> will never be short of greens and flowers 
 my initial stake in this <unk> enterprise has grown tenfold according to my conservative calculations 
 at the same time my share in a wide variety of entertainment <unk> has given perhaps the most dramatic demonstration of the benefits of creative personal financial planning 
 over the course of the decade for instance my return on investment in the area of <unk> alone figures <unk> and <unk> has been most impressive showing <unk> annual expansion with given the way my associates play no sign of <unk> into the 1990s and beyond 
 with this personal strategy firmly in place i look forward to years of fine <unk> investments and increasing widespread leverage 
 my kids ' college education looms as perhaps the greatest future opportunity for spending although i 'll probably have to cash in their toy portfolio to take advantage of it 
 but with every step i take i 'm building wealth 
 you can too if you like me refuse to <unk> the bullet 
 so go out there and eat that debt 
 you 're right there in the mainstream of american business building value on the back of <unk> expenditures 
 henry kravis watch out 
 mr. schwartz is a business executive and writer in new york 
 when james schwartz was just a <unk> his father gave him a piece of career advice 
 he told me to choose an area where just by being <unk> i could be great recalls mr. schwartz now N 
 he tried management consulting traded in <unk> for a while and even managed professional <unk> 
 now he has settled into a career that fits the bill financial planning 
 it should be noted that mr. schwartz who operates out of <unk> colo. is a <unk> sort who likes to give his colleagues the <unk> 
 but in this case the <unk> has a very sharp point 
 though it 's probably safe to assume that the majority of financial planners are honest and even reasonably competent the fact remains that as one <unk> puts it anybody who can <unk> a mirror can call himself a financial planner 
 planners now influence the investment of several hundred billion dollars but in effect they operate in the dark 
 there is no effective regulation of planners no accepted standard for admission into their ranks a dog got into one trade group no way to assess their performance no way even to know how many of them there are estimates range from N to N 
 all anyone need do is hang up a <unk> and start planning 
 so it should come as no shock that the profession if that 's what it is has attracted a lot of people whose principal <unk> seem to be <unk> away or <unk> stealing their clients ' money 
 alarmed state and federal authorities are trying to devise ways to <unk> and regulate planners 
 industry groups and reputable planners who are members of them want comprehensive standards too they 're tired of seeing practitioners <unk> <unk> in the business press as <unk> than <unk> and <unk> than a <unk> of <unk> 
 but reform has n't taken hold yet 
 the industry is still pretty much in its wild west days says scott <unk> director of investor education for the north american securities administrators association 
 an <unk> limited survey by <unk> whose members are state <unk> regulators found that between N and N fraud and abuse by financial planners cost N investors $ N million 
 the <unk> ' gallery of planners involved includes some convicted <unk> a <unk> <unk> or two various businessmen who had planned their own previous ventures right into bankruptcy and one man who <unk> his wife 's <unk> 
 what 's more the losses they and the others caused are just what we are <unk> over says mr. <unk> adding that the majority of <unk> probably go <unk> 
 so do just about all the losses that could be attributed to the sheer <unk> of <unk> planners 
 nobody can estimate the toll but john <unk> a tampa fla. planner and head of one trade group the international association of registered financial planners thinks the danger to investors from <unk> is <unk> far greater than that from <unk> 
 his group like others wants minimum standards applied to all who call themselves financial planners 
 <unk> all this some people now think the best planner might be no planner at all 
 for most investors the benefits just are n't worth the risks says barbara roper who follows <unk> issues for the consumer federation of america a <unk> organization based in washington 
 she concedes that such a position is unfair to the thousands of <unk> and qualified people <unk> the trade but as a consumer advocate she feels <unk> to take it 
 she says her group used to give tips on <unk> planners check educational and experience credentials <unk> regulators and better business bureaus but found that even some people who took these steps were still getting <unk> off 
 the bad news however has n't been bad enough to kill the growing demand for financial planning 
 the tax reform act of N which eliminated many tax shelters <unk> by planners and the stock market crash the next year did cause a sharp slump in such demand and many planners had to make an <unk> exit from the business 
 but membership in the international association of financial planners iafp the industry 's biggest trade group is still nearly triple what it was in N and it 's believed that the ranks of planners who do n't belong to any group have soared as well 
 an estimated N million americans are now using financial planners and the pool of capital they influence is enormous 
 a survey of N of them conducted by the iafp in april showed that these practitioners alone had controlled or <unk> the investment of $ N billion of their clients ' money in the previous N months 
 the sheer number of planners makes the business extremely difficult if not impossible to regulate 
 even the minority of them who must register with the securities and exchange commission as investment advisers people who are in the business of counseling others on the buying and selling of securities specifically have been enough to <unk> the agency 's capacity 
 the sec has only about N staffers assigned to keep <unk> on investment advisers about the same as in N even though the number of advisers has tripled to about N over the past decade 
 currently a registered investment adviser can expect an sec audit only once every N years 
 a lot of bad things can happen in N years 
 it does n't take a rocket scientist to figure out our problem says <unk> <unk> director of the sec 's division of investment management 
 so the sec has proposed to congress that much of the job of oversight be turned over to an <unk> <unk> organization <unk> on the national association of securities dealers which operates in the brokerage business 
 such an organization could among other things set minimum standards for <unk> ethics and finances and punish those investment advisers who broke the rules 
 the proposal has set off a <unk> debate within an industry that was far from united to begin with 
 mr. schwartz the <unk> planner from <unk> colo. says that allowing the business to police itself would be like putting <unk> in charge of the blood bank 
 mr. <unk> the tampa planner who heads one trade group favors simply assessing the industry and giving the money to the sec to hire more staff 
 mr. <unk> 's views are not greeted with wild enthusiasm over at the iafp the major industry organization 
 when the iafp recently assembled other industry groups to discuss common standards that might be applied to planners mr. <unk> 's group was excluded 
 that may be because mr. <unk> <unk> at what he considered <unk> on his membership standards made by the rival group <unk> his dog <unk> as a member of the iafp 
 then he sent the <unk> 's picture with the certificate of membership it was made out to <unk> <unk> <unk> to every newspaper he could think of 
 the states have their own ideas about regulation and <unk> 
 <unk> the organization of state securities regulators is pushing for a model regulatory statute already adopted in eight states 
 it requires financial planners to register with states pass <unk> tests and reveal to customers any conflicts of interest 
 the most common conflict involves compensation 
 <unk> estimates that nearly N N of planners receive some or all of their income from sales commissions on securities insurance and other financial products they recommend 
 the issue is the planner putting his clients into the best investments or the ones that <unk> the biggest commissions 
 in N the new york attorney general 's office got an order from a state court in albany <unk> down first meridian corp. an albany <unk> firm that had invested $ N million on behalf of nearly N investors 
 in its notice of action the attorney general said the company had promised to put clients into balanced investment portfolios instead the attorney general alleged the company consistently <unk> <unk> customers into high-risk investments in paintings coins and florida <unk> 
 those investments paid big commissions to first meridian payments investors were never told about the attorney general alleged 
 investors were further assured that only those with a <unk> net worth would be accepted 
 in practice the attorney general alleged in an affidavit if an investor had access to cash the chances of being turned down by first meridian were about as probable as being rejected by the <unk> club 
 and the attorney general added first meridian 's president roger v. <unk> portrayed himself as a financial expert when his <unk> largely <unk> of a high-school <unk> work as a real-estate and insurance salesman and a <unk> as supervisor at a highway toll <unk> 
 first meridian and its officials are currently under investigation for possible criminal wrongdoing according to a spokeswoman for the attorney general 
 harry <unk> mr. <unk> 's attorney says his client denies any wrongdoing and adds that the attorney general 's <unk> about first meridian 's business practices are incorrect 
 as for mr. <unk> 's <unk> the <unk> attorneys for the state of new york decided mr. <unk> was n't qualified because he did n't have a harvard degree says mr. <unk> 
 civil suits against planners by clients seeking recovery of funds are increasingly common 
 two such actions both filed earlier this year in georgia state court in atlanta could be particularly embarrassing to the industry both name j. chandler peterson an atlanta financial planner who is a founder and past chairman of the iafp as defendant 
 one suit filed by more than three dozen investors charges that mr. peterson <unk> much of the $ N million put into a limited partnership that he operated and <unk> spending some of it to pay his own legal bills and to invest in other companies in which he had an interest 
 those companies in turn paid mr. peterson commissions and fees the suit alleges 
 the other suit was filed by two men in a dispute over $ N investments each says he made with mr. peterson as part of an effort to purchase the bank of <unk> in <unk> <unk> 
 one plaintiff a doctor testified in an affidavit that he also gave mr. peterson $ N to join a sort of investment club which essentially gave the physician the privilege of making additional investments with mr. peterson 
 in affidavits each plaintiff claims mr. peterson promised the bank purchase would be completed by the end of N or the money returned 
 mr. peterson took the plaintiffs ' and other investors ' money to a meeting of the bank 's directors 
 wearing a business suit and western-style hat and <unk> he opened up his <unk> and dumped $ N million in cash on a table in front of the directors says <unk> <unk> the bank 's president 
 he said he wanted to show the color of his money recalls mr. <unk> 
 bank officials however showed him the door and the sale never came off 
 according to the suit mr. peterson has yet to return the plaintiffs ' investment 
 they want it back 
 mr. peterson declines to comment on specific allegations in the two suits saying he prefers to save such responses for court 
 but he does say that all of his activities have been entirely proper 
 on the suit by the limited partners he says he is considering a <unk> suit against the plaintiffs 
 the suit he adds is almost in the nature of a <unk> by a handful of <unk> people 
 <unk> the suit over the bank bid mr. peterson says it is filled with <unk> language and half <unk> 
 he declines to go into <unk> 
 mr. peterson says the suits against him are less a measure of his work than they are a sign of the times in which people generally are more prone to sue 
 i do n't know anybody in the industry who has n't experienced litigation he says 
 mr. peterson also says he does n't consider himself a financial planner anymore 
 he now calls himself an investment banker 
 in many scams or alleged scams involving planners it 's plain that only a <unk> of common sense on the part of the investors would have kept them out of harm 's way 
 using it would n't a <unk> hesitate to pay tens of thousands of dollars just for a chance to invest <unk> planner 
 other cases go to show that an old saw still applies if it sounds too good to be true it probably is 
 certificates of deposit do n't pay N N a year for example but that did n't give <unk> to clients of one alabama planner 
 now they 're losers and he 's in jail in mobile county 
 cds yielding N N are even more <unk> especially when the issuing bank in the marshall islands is merely a mail drop watched over by a local <unk> operator but investors fell for that one too 
 and the colorado planner who promised to make some of his clients <unk> on investments of as <unk> as $ N 
 never mind 
 you already know the answer

 law-enforcement authorities say that at any given time a host of fraudulent <unk> operations <unk> with the many legitimate businesses here

 we call them fraud farms 
 welcome to that <unk> of <unk> known as newport beach 
 this city of more than N is known for <unk> <unk> and rich residents 
 it is also known as the fraud capital of the u.s. dubbed by investigators and the media as the <unk> de fraud 
 how does a community famous for its high living end up as a haven for <unk> 
 clearly the existence of the former <unk> the latter 
 the places <unk> for breeding <unk> like the miami neighborhood known as the <unk> mile and las vegas 's flashy strip of casinos invariably offer fast cars high <unk> glamorous women and lots of <unk> 
 you do n't hear much about unusual <unk> of fraud in green bay or <unk> 
 con men hate snow 
 newport beach fits the <unk> artists ' specifications perfectly 
 what more could a con man in search of the easy life ask for 
 nothing seems hard here 
 the <unk> are soft the waves <unk> gently and the palm trees <unk> <unk> 
 <unk> is <unk> 
 moreover <unk> is <unk> 
 the median price of homes is $ N more than N vessels fill what the chamber of commerce calls the nation 's largest <unk> harbor 
 <unk> cocaine and <unk> <unk> mr. <unk> 
 that 's what they 're after 
 the rich image of newport beach also helps lend the con artists ' operation an air of respectability 
 one reason they use newport beach is that it sounds <unk> than most addresses says david katz a u.s. attorney who until recently headed a <unk> southern california fraud task force 
 newport beach is known in <unk> island for having a lot of rich people 
 no wonder all kinds of big-time scams have <unk> here from phony <unk> <unk> sales to <unk> car dealers to <unk> <unk> traders 
 but above all this is the national headquarters for <unk> operators those <unk> <unk> salesmen who use the telephone to extract money from the <unk> and the greedy and then <unk> 
 because only a fraction of them are ever prosecuted nobody really knows how much money <unk> <unk> operators really harvest 
 i 've heard that there is $ N billion taken in nationwide by boiler rooms every year mr. <unk> says 
 if that 's true orange county has to be at least N N of that 
 and most of the truly big scams in orange county seem to <unk> in newport beach or one of the other <unk> communities that <unk> this <unk> city that <unk> around a point of land on the california coast south of los angeles 
 in fact sophisticated <unk> <unk> scams are known <unk> among law-enforcement types as newport beach operations 
 that contrasts with the <unk> sales of things such as <unk> sets and office supplies that are known as hollywood scams 
 newport beach <unk> concentrate on precious metals and <unk> deals that typically cost thousands of dollars a shot 
 the investors range from elderly <unk> to affluent professionals 
 in one <unk> recent example of a newport beach boiler room prospective investors in capital trust inc. were allegedly told that their investment in precious metals was insured against losses caused by employees due to dishonesty destruction or disappearance according to an indictment handed up by a federal grand jury in los angeles last month 
 thus <unk> <unk> investors sent $ N million to the newport beach company most of which was diverted to unauthorized uses the indictment charges 
 douglas jones an attorney representing richard o. kelly sr. the chairman and president of capital trust says his client denies that there was any attempt to <unk> investors 
 there were some business deals that went bad mr. jones says but no intent to <unk> 
 newport beach operations differ from the hollywood boiler rooms in style as well as in dollars 
 traditionally boiler rooms operate on the cheap since few if any customers ever visit their offices 
 indeed the name <unk> from the tendency among <unk> <unk> to rent cheap <unk> space near the boiler room 
 but says mr. katz the u.s. attorney the interesting thing about newport beach operations is that they give themselves the <unk> of beautiful offices with <unk> <unk> 
 when we go there it 's quite different from these hollywood places where the <unk> are spread out on the table and the people are picking their <unk> 
 the newport beach operators also tend to <unk> themselves privately 
 investigators cite the case of <unk> <unk> who is currently serving a <unk> sentence at <unk> federal prison for his role in <unk> investment corp. which promised investors returns of as much as N N on precious metals 
 mr. <unk> who pleaded guilty to five counts of fraud in federal court in los angeles drove a leased mercedes and lived in an expensive home on <unk> <unk> an island in newport 's harbor according to investigators 
 with the $ N million received from investors he took frequent <unk> with friends to exotic <unk> and leased an expensive <unk> for his girlfriend whom he met at the shop where he got his <unk> suits 
 it 's amazing the amount of money that goes up their nose out to the dog track or to the tables in las vegas mr. katz says 
 all this talk of boiler rooms and fraud is <unk> to the city 's legitimate business element 
 vincent <unk> <unk> regional manager of property management systems insists he does n't know of any <unk> <unk> operating in the N million square feet of office space around fashion island that his company leases for irvine co. the owner and developer of the project 
 mr. <unk> has rejected a few prospective tenants who provided incomplete financial information and acknowledges that <unk> operators are not easily <unk> 
 investigators stress that building owners are victims too since boiler rooms often leave without paying rent 
 richard <unk> president of the newport harbor area chamber of commerce calls boiler rooms a negative we wish we could get rid of 
 actually we do n't get much negative publicity about this he insists except for the press who write about it 
 mr. lancaster is deputy chief of the wall street journal 's dallas bureau 
 you went to college and thought you got an education 
 now you discover that you never learned the most important lesson how to send your kids to college 
 true when you went to college there was n't that much to learn 
 stick some money in an <unk> account and watch it grow 
 now investment salesmen say it 's time to take some risks if you want the kind of returns that will buy your <unk> a ticket to prestige <unk> in N years 
 in short throw away the <unk> and go for the glory 
 the reason is cost 
 nothing in the <unk> of tuition <unk> parents for the 1980s 
 <unk> at private colleges rose N N in the N years ended in june of this year that 's twice the N N increase in consumer prices for the same period 
 a year at harvard now goes for $ N 
 by N when this year 's <unk> hit campus a four-year ivy league <unk> will cost $ N give or take a few <unk> at <unk> time 
 stanford mit and other <unk> will cost no less 
 so what 's a parent to do 
 some investment advisers are suggesting in effect a bet on a start-up investment pool maybe even on margin 
 others prefer <unk> zero-coupon bonds 
 still others say why not take a chance on a <unk> growth fund 
 you 're not going to make it in a N N bank account says james <unk> director of mutual funds at t. rowe price 
 to get the necessary growth adds murray <unk> a marketing official at the financial programs mutual-fund group you need to go to the stock market 
 in other words a little volatility never hurt 
 it never hurt anyone that is unless the growth funds do n't grow when you need them to 
 or the zero-coupon bonds turn out not to have been discounted deeply enough to pay your kid 's tuition 
 that 's the dilemma for today 's parent 
 although many experts are advising risk no one has a good answer for you if the risk does n't pay off 
 help may be on the way 
 the antitrust division of the justice department is investigating the oddly similar tuition charges and increases among the top schools 
 fear of the price police could help cool things off in the 1990s 
 and then there 's always state u 
 but parents ' <unk> for a <unk> education for their children is growing like their taste for fancy wheels and vintage wine 
 <unk> aware of public concern lawmakers and financial middlemen are working overtime to create and sell college savings and investment schemes 
 their message explicit or implicit is that a good college will cost so much by whenever you want it that the tried and true wo n't do anymore 
 forget about treasury bills or a money-market fund 
 the latest wave of marketing is <unk> 
 several <unk> including the financial programs franklin and t. rowe price mutual-fund groups and the edward d. jones brokerage house are advertising college planner tables and charts that tell you how much you need to put aside regularly 
 the calculations generally rely on an after-tax rate of return of N N annually a rate historically <unk> by the individual in only one place the stock market 
 most of the <unk> are free but <unk> financial programs sells for $ N a version <unk> to the age of the child and the college of choice 
 the figures are <unk> 
 to build a <unk> egg that would pay for stanford when a current <unk> reaches college age parents would need to set aside $ N a month for N years 
 they can cut this to $ N a month if the investing keeps up through college 
 and they can further reduce the monthly amount if they start saving earlier when mother and child come home from the hospital 
 <unk> a cheaper college into the <unk> still does n't generate an installment most people can live with 
 using a recent average <unk> cost of about $ N a year t. rowe price 's planner <unk> $ N monthly if the plan begins when the child is six 
 since the formula assumes an N N <unk> return in a mutual fund there would also be $ N in taxes to pay over the N years 
 not everyone is so pessimistic 
 people are basically peddling a lot of fear says arthur <unk> a consultant to the american council on education in washington 
 he takes issue with projections that do n't factor in students ' own contribution which reduces most parents ' burden substantially 
 still he says it 's no bad thing if all the marketing <unk> people into putting aside a little more 
 the situation you want to avoid is having somebody not save anything and hope they 'll be able to do it out of current income he says 
 that 's crazy 
 his advice do n't panic 
 parents he says should aim at whatever regular investment sum they can afford 
 half the amount that the investment tables suggest might be a good goal he adds 
 that way parents will reduce borrowings and outlays from current income when the time comes to pay tuition 
 mr. <unk> <unk> that the best investment choice is mutual funds because they are managed and over time have nearly kept up with the broad stock averages 
 he favors either an <unk> fund or a balanced fund that <unk> both stocks and bonds 
 in their anxiety however parents and other student <unk> are <unk> to new schemes 
 they have laid out about $ N billion for so-called <unk> zero-coupon municipal bonds so far offered by connecticut illinois virginia and eight other states 
 and they have bought about $ N million in <unk> plans offered in michigan florida and wyoming 
 the prepaid plans take payment today usually at current <unk> or at a slight discount for a promise that tuition will be covered tomorrow 
 the <unk> bonds tax-free offered in small denominations and usually containing a provision that they wo n't be called before maturity seem to be <unk> for college <unk> 
 like other <unk> they pay all their interest at maturity meaning that buyers can time things so that their bonds pay off just when junior graduates from high school 
 their <unk> effect is also <unk> 
 in june virginia sold bonds for $ N that will pay $ N in N 
 but richard anderson head of the forum for college financing alternatives at columbia university a research group partly financed by the federal government says <unk> are particularly <unk> 
 their price falls further than that of other bonds when inflation and interest rates kick up 
 that wo n't matter if they are held to maturity but if for any reason the parents need to sell them before then there could be a severe loss of principal 
 had <unk> been available in N and had parents bought a face amount equal to four years ' tuition at the time aiming for their children 's N <unk> they would have been left with only enough to pay for two years mr. anderson figures 
 most other bonds however would probably not have fared much better 
 the prepaid plans may be a good bet provided the guarantee of future tuition is secure 
 issuing states generally limit the guarantees to <unk> institutions however and buyers get refunds without much interest if the children do n't attend the specified schools 
 two private groups are seeking securities and exchange commission approval for plans that could be more broadly <unk> 
 mr. anderson wants the prestige colleges to sponsor such a plan 
 the issue here may be the <unk> of the guarantee 
 prepayments much like mutual-fund purchases are <unk> for investment 
 sponsors are naturally counting on their ability to keep ahead of tuition inflation with investment returns 
 but buyers are essentially betting on a start-up investment fund with no track record and some have been encouraged to borrow to do so 
 one problem is that the internal revenue service has decided that the investment earnings and gains of the sponsors ' funds are taxable 
 the colleges as educational institutions had hoped that would n't be the case 
 based on historical rates of return mr. anderson <unk> a N N stock portfolio <unk> to the market would have kept up with tuition and taxes in the 20th century 
 but sponsors might not pick the stocks that will match the market 
 and they 're <unk> more toward fixed income whose returns after tax have trailed tuition increases 
 i 'm not sure they 're going to make it work says mr. anderson 
 what happens if the sponsors do n't have the cash to pay the <unk> 
 florida and wyoming have backed up their guarantees with the full faith and credit of the state governments meaning that taxpayers will pick up any slack 
 not so michigan 
 its plan is set up as an independent agency 
 the state says there 's no worry investment returns combined with fees and the gains from unused plans will provide all the cash it needs 
 mr. <unk> covers education from the wall street journal 's boston bureau 
 if you start saving for your child 's <unk> on jan. N N here 's the monthly sum you will need to invest to pay for four years at yale <unk> <unk> and university of minnesota

 among the <unk> farmers in the <unk> delta land of <unk> county <unk> allen d. tharp of <unk> was one of the best known and most <unk> 
 he sold <unk> <unk> to stock other farmers ' <unk> and he bought back <unk> <unk> that he <unk> to market along with his own <unk> crop 
 and he nearly always bought and sold for cash 
 along the way mr. tharp omitted a total of $ N million from his receipts reported on federal tax returns for three years 
 the returns landed in the hands of an internal revenue service criminal investigator samuel james baker 
 mr. baker interviewed or wrote to hundreds of <unk> farmers <unk> and processors throughout the south before coming up with detailed estimates of purchases and sales in pounds and dollars by mr. tharp and others 
 unknown to mr. tharp he had <unk> his net on a special irs project to catch <unk> farmers and <unk> inclined to <unk> on their taxes 
 confronted with the evidence mr. tharp pleaded guilty to one charge of filing a false return and was fined $ N and sentenced to N months in prison 
 he also owes a lot of back taxes interest and civil fraud penalties 
 a lot of taxpayers out there are n't as <unk> as one might think 
 federal and state tax enforcers develop many group targets for investigation on the basis of <unk> high income type of income or some other characteristic that may signal an opportunity or tendency to hide income or <unk> deductions 
 many <unk> long have seemed to be targets because of the exotic or <unk> efforts of some members to offset high income with fake losses from phony tax shelters <unk> who invested in <unk> dubbed foreign films or airline pilots who raised <unk> on their days off 
 mail-order ministers have been <unk> 
 now television and radio <unk> are under scrutiny 
 the irs recently won part of its <unk> battle with the church of <unk> over <unk> when the u.s. supreme court held that members ' payments to the church were n't deductible because the members received services in return 
 irs statistics show that the more persistent <unk> of income among sole <unk> of businesses include <unk> dealers entertainment producers <unk> <unk> and taxi owners 
 small businesses in general account for almost N N of <unk> personal income the irs has said 
 once such abuses become so pervasive the irs builds another factor into its secret computer formula for <unk> returns for audit and does n't need special projects for them 
 san <unk> have a much higher <unk> of audits than average because more of them score high under that formula not because irs agents envy their life styles 
 many <unk> for mass cheating such as questionable tax shelters and home offices have <unk> so broadly that congress has passed <unk> laws to close them 
 deductions of charitable gifts of highly valued art now must be accompanied by <unk> 
 and laws requiring the reporting of more <unk> of transactions have enabled the irs to rely on computers to <unk> out discrepancies with returns and to generate <unk> inquiries to taxpayers 
 <unk> <unk> income can be spotted by computer because a <unk> of <unk> who gets a deduction must report the former spouse 's social security number 
 <unk> applicants now must give social security numbers enabling the irs to see whether americans living abroad are filing required u.s. returns 
 but while irs computers focus routinely on target groups like these the agency has assigned many agents to special projects that need more personal attention 
 in most cases the irs says these projects are local or regional rather than national and arise because auditors in an area detect some pattern of abuse among say factory workers claiming that having a <unk> of dependents <unk> them from tax <unk> or <unk> owners <unk> losses from sideline charter businesses 
 the national office currently has N <unk> audit projects according to marshall v. <unk> deputy assistant commissioner for examination 
 auditors involved in <unk> projects ca n't send anyone to jail but they can make life <unk> in other ways for one by imposing some of the N different civil penalties for negligence failure to file a return and the like 
 the targeted audit groups include direct sellers people who sell cosmetics <unk> and other items door to door or at home parties and employers who label workers as independent contractors instead of employees to avoid the employer share of payroll taxes 
 other projects look for offenders among <unk> who get cash tips people who engage in large cash transactions and people whose returns show they sold a home for a profit without <unk> the capital gain in another home by the end of the same year the gain must be rolled over within two years to defer tax 
 and now that returns must show dependents ' social security numbers the irs wants to see which dependents show up on more than one return and which dependents turn out to be <unk> 
 impetus for the <unk> project came from a congressional hearing some years back 
 it prompted an irs study that found many sellers were <unk> income and treating large amounts of <unk> travel and other personal expenses as business costs mr. <unk> says 
 the study provided criteria for <unk> out returns of potentially <unk> taxpayers who report low income and large expenses from a <unk> business 
 the tax court recently denied business deductions by mr. and mrs. peter s. rubin of cherry hill n.j. who both were <unk> distributors of <unk> products in addition to their regular jobs as sales people in other fields 
 for N they reported gross income of $ N from <unk> sales offset by expenses totaling $ N including car costs of $ N and travel and entertainment costs of $ N 
 the tax court did n't believe that the <unk> who earned $ N in their regular jobs treated the sideline as a real business and derived merely <unk> elements of recreation and other personal pleasure and benefits from it 
 the direct selling association a trade group points out that its members which include <unk> corp. cooperate with the irs to distribute <unk> material to sales people and are helping to prepare a <unk> television program on the subject 
 the <unk> project which began in N involves about N irs agents 
 in the fiscal nine months ended june N reports raymond p. keenan assistant commissioner for collection they examined about N employers assessed more than $ N million in <unk> employment taxes and <unk> about N workers as employees instead of self-employed contractors 
 the number of <unk> workers may be in the millions mostly paid by small firms 
 many workers especially professionals want to remain independent to avoid tax <unk> and to continue to <unk> many expenses that employees ca n't 
 but many others who want to qualify for employee benefits and unemployment compensation become <unk> for the irs says jerry <unk> who manages the irs project 's force of nine agents in north and central florida from <unk> 
 firms that are paying employment taxes also provide leads to competitors that are n't he says 
 in his area mr. <unk> continues the <unk> employers most commonly are in construction doing <unk> <unk> <unk> and similar work 
 but a medical clinic with about N employees <unk> listed all of them including physicians and <unk> as independent contractors 
 the irs assessed the clinic $ N in back payroll taxes 
 it assessed nearly $ N against a <unk> company that carried about N <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and other employees as self-employed <unk> 
 <unk> states also are becoming more aggressive <unk> of tax <unk> and perhaps none tracks them down with more <unk> than does new york since it acquired an $ N million computer system in N 
 the state 's tax enforcers have <unk> data bases from other new york agencies that license or register professionals and businesses from exchange agreements with the irs N other states and two canadian provinces and even from <unk> yellow pages 
 thus armed for massive matching of documents by computer they single out <unk> groups looking primarily for people who have n't filed new york income-tax returns 
 the state has <unk> through records relating to architects stockbrokers lawyers in the new york city area construction workers from out of the state and homeowners who claim to be residents of other states especially florida which has no personal income tax 
 soon to feel the glare of attention are lawyers elsewhere in the state doctors <unk> and accountants says frederick g. <unk> director of the <unk> division that develops the <unk> programs 
 the department has collected over $ N million from brokers so far and recommended more than N of them for criminal prosecution 
 in the early stage of checking people with incomes exceeding $ N who were filing <unk> returns it squeezed $ N million out of a man who was <unk> as a florida resident 
 we think we can reclaim hundreds of millions of dollars just through the <unk> project mr. <unk> declares 
 mr. <unk> is editor of the wall street journal 's tax report column 
 in finding good news in berkeley 's new freshman <unk> plan the <unk> class editorial sept. N you 're reading the headline but not the story 
 the plan indeed raises from N N to N N the number of <unk> applicants admitted strictly by academic criteria 
 but that does n't mean half of the students attending berkeley will be admitted this way 
 the plan is talking about applicants admitted not students who <unk> 
 since the yield from this top <unk> of applicants is relatively low boosting admits from N N to N N will boost <unk> from about N N to N N of the class 
 in addition perhaps N N of <unk> will come from a new category consisting of applicants whose academic credentials narrowly missed gaining them admission in the first category 
 but against that combined increase of N N in students chosen by academic criteria the plan <unk> a large category in which <unk> now are based on grades test scores and supplemental points for factors such as high-school <unk> <unk> <unk> and an <unk> 
 this category now accounts for about N N of admits and N N of <unk> 
 the plan thus will decrease by N N for a net loss of N N the number of students admitted primarily by academic criteria 
 who will take over these places 
 the plan creates a new category of students from <unk> <unk> backgrounds a concept not yet defined and gives them about N N of the class 
 one of the plan 's authors has defended the <unk> disadvantage category as perhaps making more sense than the current <unk> preferences based on race 
 perhaps it does 
 but the new category does not replace or reduce berkeley 's broad racial preferences 
 nor will students from <unk> groups who are admitted through the new category be counted against the <unk> target for their group 
 the plan thus places a large new <unk> program based on <unk> disadvantage on top of the existing program based on race 
 the role of academic criteria in choosing berkeley 's <unk> can only decline as a result

 this is a story about <unk> 
 most of us know a <unk> 
 many of us are <unk> 
 but what we may not know is just what makes somebody a <unk> 
 what makes people <unk> out their credit-card numbers to a caller they 've never heard of 
 do they really believe that the number is just for <unk> and is simply a <unk> on the road to being a <unk> winner 
 what makes a person buy an oil well from some <unk> knocking on the screen door 
 or an interest in a retirement community in nevada that will knock your <unk> off once it is built 
 because in the end these people always wind up asking themselves the same question how could i be so stupid 
 there are unfortunately plenty of answers to that question and <unk> artists know all of them 
 these people are very skilled at finding out what makes a person <unk> says kent neal chief of the <unk> unit of the <unk> county state attorney 's office in fort <unk> fla. a major haven for boiler rooms 
 once they size them up then they know what <unk> to push 
 john <unk> agrees and he ought to know 
 he used to be a <unk> salesman peddling investments in oil and gas wells and rare coins 
 there 's a <unk> psychology of the sale and different <unk> you pitch different ways he says 
 the most obvious pitch of course is the lure of big returns 
 we 're all a little greedy 
 everyone is vulnerable says charles harper associate regional administrator for the securities and exchange commission in miami 
 these guys <unk> on human <unk> 
 while the promises of big profits ought to set off warning bells they often do n't in part because <unk> <unk> have become <unk> in american <unk> 
 the overnight success story is part of our culture and our society puts an emphasis on it with <unk> and ed <unk> making <unk> out of people says michael <unk> an associate professor of psychology at the university of kentucky in louisville 
 other people are making it overnight and the rest who <unk> daily do n't want to miss that opportunity when it seems to come along 
 adds spencer <unk> branch chief for enforcement at the sec in fort worth texas why do people play the <unk> when the odds are great against them 
 people are shooting for a dream 
 clearly though <unk> artists have to be a bit more <unk> than simply promising millions the psychology of <unk> is n't simply the psychology of the greedy 
 there 's also for instance the need to be part of the <unk> 
 so one popular <unk> is to make a prospective investor feel like an insider joining an exclusive group that is about to make a killing 
 between N and N for instance <unk> oil in winter haven fla. sold interests in oil wells to a very select group of local residents while turning away numerous other eager investors 
 the owner of the company stephen smith who has since pleaded guilty to state and federal fraud charges <unk> to investors that he had a secret agreement with amoco oil co. and said the location of his wells was confidential according to a civil suit filed in a florida state court by the florida comptroller 's office 
 neither the amoco agreement nor the wells existed the suit alleged 
 such schemes says tony <unk> chief of the <unk> unit of the federal bureau of investigation in washington d.c. appeal to investors ' desire to believe this is really true and that they are part of a chosen group being given this opportunity 
 at times salesmen may <unk> the inside information with the notion that this is some slightly <unk> slightly illegal investment the person is being included in says mr. <unk> 
 in appealing to those with a bit of <unk> in their hearts the fraud artist can insist that a person keep an investment secret <unk> himself from being discovered and keeping his victim from consulting with others 
 it also adds to the mystery of the venture 
 mr. <unk> the <unk> veteran believes that for many investors the <unk> scams carry a <unk> element of excitement 
 once people got into it i was allowing them to live a dream he says 
 he <unk> them with <unk> on the investment such as funny things that happened at the well that week he says 
 you gave them some excitement that they did n't have in their lives 
 mr. <unk> who was convicted in florida state court of selling <unk> securities and in california state court of unlawful use of the telephone to <unk> and <unk> is now on <unk> 
 he says he has quit the business and is back in school <unk> in psychology with aspirations to go into industrial psychology 
 for some investors it 's the appearances that leave them <unk> 
 the <unk> of success go a long way wearing the right clothes doing the right things says paul <unk> an associate professor of psychology at harvard 
 conservative appearances make people think it 's a conservative investment 
 people <unk> lose money on risky investments that they did n't realize were a <unk> he says 
 paul <unk> a phoenix ariz. attorney says a promise of <unk> returns would have made him leery 
 but mr. <unk> who says he lost $ N in one <unk> deal and $ N in another says a salesman used a <unk> approach with him sending investment literature a contract limiting the firm 's liability and an insurance policy 
 when he visited the company 's office he says it had all the <unk> of legitimacy 
 still others are <unk> by a desire to do both well and good says douglas watson commanding officer of the los angeles police department 's <unk> division 
 <unk> <unk> are the most visible targets of unscrupulous <unk> investment pitches 
 but hardly the only ones the scams promise among other things to help save the environment feed <unk> families and prevent the disappearance of children 
 <unk> say isolated people who do n't discuss their investments with others are particularly at risk for fraud 
 <unk> artists seek out such people or try to make sure that their victims <unk> themselves 
 for instance salesmen may counter a man 's <unk> that he wants to discuss an investment with his wife by asking who wears the <unk> in your family 
 or an investor who wants his <unk> 's advice may be told you seem like a guy who can make up his own mind 
 often con artists will try to <unk> their victims by <unk> <unk> between them

 donald <unk> an attorney for the <unk> firm denies the fraud allegations and says the <unk> were fully <unk> that they were pursuing a high-risk investment 
 it 's not uncommon for these guys to send pictures of themselves or their families to <unk> themselves to their clients says <unk> <unk> chief of the <unk> section of the u.s. attorney 's office in los angeles 
 we 've seen cases where salesmen will affect the <unk> of the region of the country they are calling 
 anything to make a sale 
 experts say that whatever a person 's particular weak point timing is crucial 
 people may be particularly vulnerable to <unk> pitches when they are in the midst of a major upheaval in their lives 
 sometimes when people are making big changes retiring from their jobs moving to a new area they lose their bearings says <unk> <unk> a licensed <unk> who is now an investment adviser and principal in <unk> inc. a birmingham mich. <unk> firm 
 they may be susceptible to some song and dance if it hits them at the right time 
 they are obviously also more susceptible when they need money <unk> for instance trying to bolster their fixed income or parents <unk> over how to pay for a child 's college expenses 
 these people are n't necessarily stupid or <unk> 
 almost all of us in comparable circumstances might be <unk> in some way says <unk> <unk> a psychology professor at the university of southern california in los angeles 
 <unk> <unk> thinks that 's what happened to him 
 mr. <unk> a <unk> delta air lines engineer invested some $ N in penny stocks through a broker who promised quick returns 
 we were saving up to buy a house and my wife was pregnant says mr. <unk> 
 it was just before the christmas holidays and i figured we could use some extra cash 
 the investment is worth about $ N today 
 maybe it was just a vulnerable time says mr. <unk>

 fox hunting has been defined as the <unk> in pursuit of the <unk> but at least it 's exercise 
 at least it has a little <unk> 
 most of us have to spend our time on <unk> that afford neither <unk> duties rather than <unk> 
 like trying to buy life insurance for instance an <unk> notably lacking in <unk> 
 call it the <unk> <unk> after the <unk> 
 but sooner or later most of us have to think about life insurance just as we often have to think about having <unk> work 
 and my time has come 
 i 'm N married no children and employed in writing stories like this one 
 in times past life-insurance salesmen targeted heads of household meaning men but <unk> is a <unk> family and accustomed to it 
 so if anything happened to me i 'd want to leave behind enough so that my <unk> husband would be able to pay off the mortgage and some other debts though not i admit enough to put any potential second wife in the <unk> of luxury 
 figuring that maybe $ N to $ N would do but having no idea of what kind of policy i wanted i looked at the <unk> products of a dozen companies and plunged into a <unk> of <unk> 
 over the past decade or two while i was thinking about fox hunting the insurance industry has spawned an incredible number of products variations on products and variations on the variations 
 besides term life and whole life the old <unk> we now have universal life universal <unk> life flexible adjustable universal life policies with <unk> bonuses policies <unk> with exotic riders living benefit policies and on and on 
 what to do 
 first <unk> 
 <unk> of all their riders special provisions and other bells and <unk> insurance policies can still be <unk> under two broad categories so-called pure insurance which <unk> no cash value in the policy and pays off only upon death and permanent insurance which provides not only a death benefit but also a cash value in the policy that can be used in various ways while the insured is still alive 
 if all you want is <unk> coverage pure insurance a term policy gives you maximum bang for your buck within limits 
 it 's much cheaper than permanent insurance bought at the same age 
 but term means just that the policy is written for a specific time period only and must be renewed when it expires 
 it may also <unk> that the insured must pass another medical <unk> before renewal if you <unk> which means you need insurance more than ever you may not be able to buy it 
 even if you 're healthy and can renew your premium will go up sharply because you 're that much older 
 so term insurance may not be as cheap as it looks 
 there are all sorts of variations on term insurance policies structured to pay off your mortgage debt term riders tacked on to permanent insurance and many others 
 one <unk> that appealed to me at first was the money smart term life policy offered by amex life insurance co. the american express unit to the parent company 's credit-card holders 
 upon examination however i <unk> whether the plan made a lot of sense 
 amex said it would charge me $ N a year for $ N of coverage and would pay me back all the premiums i put in if i canceled the policy after N years 
 sounds great or does it 
 first if i canceled i 'd have no more insurance a not <unk> consideration 
 second the $ N i 'd get back would be much diminished in purchasing power by N years of inflation amex not i would get the benefit of the investment income on my money income that would have exceeded the inflation rate and thus given the company a real profit 
 third and most important amex would charge me a far higher premium than other reputable companies would on a straight term policy for the same amount i 'd be paying so heavily just to have the option of getting my premiums back that i 'd almost have to cancel to make the whole thing <unk> 
 that would be all right with amex which could then lock in its investment profit but it does n't add up to a smart money move for me 
 which goes to show that the first law applies in insurance as in anything else there is no free lunch there is only marketing 
 and the second law unique to insurance 
 if i die early i win a <unk> victory since i ca n't enjoy it and if i live long the insurer wins 
 always 
 this is worth <unk> when insurers and their salesmen try to sell you permanent insurance the kind that <unk> cash value 
 the word death can not be escaped entirely by the industry but salesmen dodge it wherever possible or <unk> it in <unk> <unk> to talk about savings and investment instead 
 the implication is that your <unk> policy is really some kind of cd or mutual-fund account with an added feature 
 that is <unk> the <unk> 
 the fact is that as a savings or investment vehicle insurance generally runs a poor second to any direct investment you might make in the same things the insurance company is putting your money into 
 that 's because you have to pay for the insurance portion of the policy and the effort required to sell and service the whole package 
 again no free lunch 
 this is reflected in a <unk> mortality cost in effect your share of the company 's estimated liability in paying off beneficiaries of people who had the <unk> to die while under its protection 
 and in most cases a huge <unk> of your premium in the initial year or two of the the policy is in effect paying the salesman 's commission as well investment returns on most policies are actually negative for several years largely because of this 
 so view permanent insurance for what it is a compromise between pure insurance and direct investment 
 the <unk> most traditional form of permanent insurance is the straight whole life policy 
 you pay a set premium for a set amount of coverage the company invests that premium in a portfolio of its choosing and your cash value and dividends grow over the years 
 one newer <unk> so called <unk> life you pay for the whole policy at once has been <unk> popular in recent years for tax reasons the insured could extract cash value in the form of policy loans and none of the proceeds were taxable even though they included gains on investment 
 congress closed this <unk> last year or thought it did 
 however <unk> capital corp. of <unk> mass. has developed a combination plan of annuity and insurance coverage that it says does not violate the new regulations and that allows policy loans without tax consequences 
 but the percentage of your cash reserve that you can borrow tax-free is very small 
 i 'm not prepared in any case to put that much money into a policy immediately so i look into the broad category called universal life 
 <unk> popular it is far more flexible than straight whole life 
 i can adjust the amount of insurance i want against the amount going into investment i can pay more or less than the so-called target premium in a given year and i can even <unk> payments if my cash reserves are enough to cover the insurance portion of the policy 
 in looking at these and other policies i learn to ask pointed questions about some of the assumptions built into policy <unk> the rows of numbers that show me the buildup of my cash values over the years 
 they commonly give two scenarios one is based on interest rates that the company guarantees usually N N to N N and the other on the rate it is currently getting on investment often N N or more 
 projecting the latter over several decades i find my cash buildup is impressive but can any high interest rate prevail for that long 
 not likely i think 
 also some policy <unk> assume that mortality costs will decline or that i will get some sort of dividend bonus after the <unk> year 
 these are not certain either 
 companies are n't comfortable playing these games but they realize they 're under pressure to make their policies look good says timothy <unk> an <unk> consultant at <unk> a unit of towers <unk> co. the big new york consulting firm 
 another factor to consider some of the companies currently earning very high yields are doing so through substantial investment in junk bonds and you know how nervous the market has been about those lately 
 there are seemingly endless <unk> to universal life and it pays to ask questions about all of them 
 at a <unk> <unk> for example a friend boasts that she 'll only have to pay premiums on her john hancock policy for seven years and that her death benefits will then be guaranteed 
 i call her agent david <unk> 
 yes he says premiums on such <unk> coverage can be structured to <unk> after a certain period but usually only if interest rates stay high enough to generate sufficient cash to cover the annual cost of insurance protection 
 if interest rates plunge the insurer may be knocking on my door asking for <unk> premium payments to maintain the same amount of protection 
 i do n't like the sound of that 
 some insurers have also started offering <unk> bonuses such as extra dividends or a marginally higher interest yield if the policy is maintained for N years 
 but glenn daily a new york-based financial consultant warns that many of these bonuses are just <unk> because most are n't guaranteed by the companies 
 and the feature is so new he adds that no insurer has yet established a track record for actually making such payments 
 so-called <unk> provisions also merit a close inspection 
 offered by insurers that include <unk> life insurance co. jackson national life insurance co. and national travelers life insurance co. these policy riders let me tap a portion of my death benefits while i 'm still alive 
 some provisions would let me collect a percentage of the policy 's face value to pay for long-term care such as <unk> stays others would allow payments for catastrophic <unk> and conditions such as cancer heart <unk> <unk> failure and kidney transplants 
 but the catastrophic events for which the <unk> can collect are narrowly defined vary from policy to policy and generally permit use of only a small fraction of the face amount of insurance 
 also financial planners advising on insurance say that to their knowledge there has not yet been a tax ruling <unk> these advance payments from taxes 
 and considering the extra cost of such provisions some figure that people interested in say paying for extended <unk> care would be better off just buying a separate policy that provides it 
 i 'm more <unk> impressed by <unk> life even though it turns out to be <unk> life 
 <unk> selling these policies market them directly to the public or otherwise do n't use commissioned salesmen there is still a load annual administrative fees and initial <unk> charges but i figure that the lack of commission and of surrender fees for dropping the policy early still <unk> me a lot 
 i compared one universal policy for $ N face amount from such an insurer american life insurance corp. of lincoln neb. with a similar offering from equitable life assurance society of the u.s. which operates through N commissioned salesmen 
 after one year i could walk away from the <unk> policy with $ N but <unk> get only $ N from the equitable 
 the difference is magnified by time too 
 at age N when i 'd stop paying premiums the <unk> offering would have a projected cash value $ N higher than the other even though the equitable 's policy illustration assumed a fractionally higher interest rate 
 did i buy it 
 well not yet 
 i 'm thinking about using the $ N annual premium to finance a trip to paris first 
 a person can do some heavy thinking about insurance there and shop for something more exciting while she 's doing it 
 rorer group inc. will report that third-quarter profit rose more than N N from a year earlier though the gain is wholly due to asset sales robert <unk> chairman president and chief executive officer said 
 his projection indicates profit in the latest quarter of more than $ N million or N cents a share compared with $ N million or N cents a share a year ago 
 mr. <unk> said in an interview that sales will show an increase from a year ago of somewhat less than N N 
 through the first six months of N sales had grown about N N from the year-earlier period 
 growth of N N would make sales for the latest quarter $ N million compared with $ N million a year ago 
 mr. <unk> said the profit growth in the latest quarter was due to the sale of two rorer drugs 
 <unk> an <unk> was sold to <unk> plc london

 he said rorer sold the drugs for nice prices and will record a combined pretax gain on the sales of $ N million 
 as the gain from the sales indicates operating profit was significantly below the year-earlier level mr. <unk> said 
 rorer in july had projected lower third-quarter operating profit but higher profit for all of N 
 he said the company is still looking for a strong fourth quarter in all areas sales operating income and net income 
 mr. <unk> attributed the decline in third-quarter operating profit to the stronger dollar which reduces the value of overseas profit when it is translated into dollars to accelerated buying of rorer products in the second quarter because of a <unk> july N price increase and to higher marketing expenses for rorer 's <unk> <unk> whose sales and market share in the u.s. had slipped in the first half of N 
 he said rorer opted to sell <unk> and <unk> to raise revenue that would kick start its increased marketing efforts behind <unk> still its <unk> product with about $ N million in world-wide sales in N 
 we had <unk> <unk> for a year he said because the company was concentrating on research and development and promoting other drugs 
 he said rorer will spend $ N million to $ N million more on <unk> advertising and promotion in the second half of N than in the year-earlier period 
 a big chunk of that additional spending came in the third quarter he said

 if you think you have stress-related problems on the job there 's good news and bad news 
 you 're probably right and you are n't alone 
 a new <unk> poll study commissioned by the new york business group on health found that a full N N of the work force at companies may suffer from anxiety disorders or a stress-related illness with about N N suffering from depression 
 the study surveyed a national group of medical directors personnel managers and employee assistance program directors about their perceptions of these problems in their companies 
 it is one of a series of studies on health commissioned by the new york business group a <unk> organization with about N members 
 the stress study was undertaken because problems related to stress are much more <unk> than they seem said leon j. <unk> executive director of the business group 
 in <unk> the study late last week dr. <unk> estimated the cost of these types of disorders to business is substantial 
 <unk> <unk> related to anxiety depression and stress costs about $ N a case in terms of worker 's compensation 
 in terms of days lost on the job the study estimated that each affected employee loses about N work days a year because of stress anxiety or depression 
 he added that the cost for stress-related compensation claims is about twice the average for all injury claims 
 we hope to <unk> employers to recognize the problems so they can do something about them dr. <unk> said 
 early intervention into these types of problems can apparently save businesses long-term expense associated with <unk> which sometimes results when these problems go <unk> for too long 
 even the courts are beginning to recognize the link between jobs and stress-related disorders in compensation cases according to a survey by the national council on compensation insurance 
 but although N N of the respondents in the study indicated that <unk> problems were fairly pervasive in the workplace there is still a social <unk> associated with people seeking help 
 the disorders which N years ago struck <unk> and older people now strike people at the <unk> of productivity says robert <unk> <unk> of the national institute of mental health who spoke at the presentation of the study 's findings 
 the poll showed that company size had a bearing on a manager 's view of the problem with N N of those in companies of more than N employees saying stress-related problems were fairly pervasive and N N of those in companies with fewer than N employees agreeing 
 the poll also noted fear of a takeover as a <unk> event in larger companies

 <unk> companies were most affected by talk of layoffs or plant closings 
 the study which received funding from upjohn co. which makes several drugs to treat stress-related <unk> also found N N of the managers said stress anxiety and depression contribute to decreased production 
 alcohol and substance abuse as a result of stress-related problems was cited by N N of those polled

 we all like stress but there 's a limit says paul d'arcy of <unk> <unk> & <unk> a corporate psychology and management consulting firm

 it is n't true that a <unk> old <unk> on a mission of <unk> to a disaster area on christmas day can fly free 
 but his circumstances are among the few that can qualify for the handful of really cheap airline tickets remaining in america 
 in recent years carriers have become much more <unk> about who can fly on the cheap 
 but there still are a few ways today 's <unk> can qualify under the airline 's many restrictions 
 one of the best deals though may mean <unk> christmas dinner with the <unk> 
 this week many carriers are announcing <unk> fares designed to get people to fly on some of the most <unk> and <unk> days of the year including christmas 
 in recent years the airlines had waited until the last moment to court christmas season <unk> with bargain fares

 although this widow earns only twice the minimum wage largely due to the earnings limit she would have to earn an additional $ N to offset her catastrophic <unk> of $ N

 when his seventh avenue fur business here was flying high N years ago jack <unk> had N workers and a large factory 
 now his <unk> employees work in an <unk> shop that he says is smaller than his old storage room 
 he also says he is losing money now 
 he blames imports 
 but just down seventh avenue where about N N of u.s. fur <unk> are made larry rosen has acquired two retail outlets <unk> his <unk> line and expanded into leather 
 he credits imports 
 the difference lies in how the two entrepreneurial furriers reacted to the foreign competition and <unk> of their industry over the past N years 
 one stuck to <unk> business <unk> while the other embraced the change 
 the small good fur salon is not what it used to be says mr. <unk> N years old 
 we make the <unk> product in the world and the americans are being kicked around 
 mr. rosen though believes imports have <unk> the industry in which he has worked for most of his N years 
 you 've got some minds here that wo n't think <unk> he says 
 import competition for u.s. furs has risen sharply since furriers started aggressively marketing <unk> mink and similar <unk> imported furs in recent years 
 merchants discovered a consumer largely ignored by <unk> furriers the younger woman even in her late <unk> who never thought she could buy a mink 
 the new market helped boost u.s. fur sales to about $ N billion a year now triple the level in the late 1970s 
 it also opened the door to furs made in south korea china hong kong and other countries 
 <unk> furs a large south korean maker says it operates N retail outlets in the u.s. and plans to open N more by the end of next year 
 mr. <unk> and other <unk> furriers call many of the the imports <unk> and poorly made 
 high-end u.s. furriers say these imports have n't squeezed them 
 but <unk> and <unk> furriers like mr. <unk> who once <unk> the <unk> seventh avenue fur district say imports have cut their sales 
 a woman who once would have saved for two or three seasons to buy a <unk> mink can now get an imported mink right away for less than $ N 
 yet mr. rosen has turned the import phenomenon to his advantage 
 early in the decade he saw that fur workers in many foreign countries were willing to work longer hours at lower wages than their american counterparts and were more open to innovation 
 in N he started a factory in greece 
 two years later he opened one in west germany 
 he also noticed that foreign makers were introducing many variations on the traditional fur and he decided to follow suit 
 by combining his strengths in innovation and quality control with the lower costs of production abroad he says he has been able to produce high-quality goods at low cost 
 to maintain control over production and avoid <unk> on foreign sources he says he still makes most of his furs in the u.s. 
 but six years ago he also began importing from the far east 
 inspired by imports mr. rosen now makes fur <unk> hats and <unk> 
 this year he produced a men 's line and offers <unk> furs in red cherry red <unk> royal blue and forest green 
 he has leather jackets from turkey that are lined with <unk> skin and topped off with <unk> <unk> 
 from asia he has mink jackets with <unk> patterns made by using different <unk> furs 
 next he will be testing <unk> <unk> called <unk> made in the far east 
 he plans to <unk> the <unk> to the backs of mink coats and jackets 
 besides adding to sales <unk> also attract retailers who may buy furs later he adds 
 other furriers have also benefited from <unk> 
 seymour <unk> the <unk> owner of <unk> <unk> furs inc. <unk> the reverse side of a persian <unk> to produce a <unk> <unk> <unk> 
 he says it accounts for N N of total sales 
 mr. rosen is also pushing retail sales 
 this year he bought two stores one in brooklyn and one in <unk> 
 other furriers have also placed more weight on retailing 
 golden <unk> furs inc. began retailing aggressively eight years ago and now retail sales account for about N N of gross income 
 in other moves mr. rosen says he bought a truck three years ago to reach more retailers 
 since then he has expanded his fleet and can now bring his furs to the front door of retailers as far away as the midwest 
 small retailers who ca n't afford to travel to his new york showroom have become fair game 
 such moves have helped mr. rosen weather the industry slump of recent years 
 the industry enjoyed six <unk> years beginning in N but since N sales have <unk> at their $ N billion peak 
 large furriers such as <unk> inc. fur vault inc. and evans inc. all reported losses in their latest fiscal years 
 <unk> of the N stock market crash head the list of reasons 
 in addition competition has <unk> the market with both <unk> and coats driving prices down 
 the <unk> movement has n't helped sales 
 warm <unk> over the past two years have trimmed demand too furriers complain 
 and those who did n't move some production overseas suffer labor shortages 
 the intensive labor needed to manufacture furs in the u.s. is not as available as it was says mr. <unk> who is starting overseas production 
 but even those who have found a way to cope with the imports and the slump fear that furs are losing part of their <unk> 
 people are promoting furs in various ways and taking the <unk> out of the fur business says stephen <unk> <unk> merchandise manager for marshall field 's department store in chicago 
 you ca n't make a commodity out of a luxury insists mr. <unk> the new york <unk> 
 he contends that chasing consumers with <unk> imports will harm the industry in the long run by reducing the prestige of furs 
 but mr. rosen <unk> whatever people want to buy i 'll sell 
 the name of the game is to move goods

 two weeks after boosting base rates to N N he pledged that rates will have to remain high for some time to come 
 mr. lawson also made it clear that he would be watching exchange rates carefully 
 a sinking pound makes imports more expensive and increases businesses ' expectations of future inflation he argued 
 in an apparent warning to currency traders who have lately been selling the british currency he stated that the exchange rates will have a major role in the assessment of monetary conditions 
 in <unk> the current monetary policy of using high interest rates to fight inflation and shore up the pound mr. lawson dismissed other approaches to managing the economy 
 he said he monitors the <unk> figures but does n't give them paramount importance as some private and government economists have suggested 
 mr. lawson also dismissed the possibility of imposing direct credit controls on britain 's financial system 
 mr. lawson 's speech delivered at the lord mayor of london 's annual dinner at mansion house came on the heels of a <unk> period for the u.k. economy 
 two weeks ago in a campaign to blunt inflation at home and arrest a world-wide plunge in the pound he raised base rates a full percentage point to N N 
 despite the increase the british currency slid below a perceived <unk> of three marks early last week 
 it was quoted at N marks in late new york trading wednesday 
 leading up to the speech was a <unk> of economic statistics suggesting that the british war on inflation will be more <unk> than previously assumed 
 unemployment in september dropped to N the lowest level since N 
 while lower <unk> is generally good news the hefty drop last month indicates that the economy is n't slowing down as much as hoped despite a doubling of interest rates over the last N months 
 meanwhile average earnings in britain were up N N in august over the previous year 
 another <unk> sign came in a surge in <unk> lending to a record # N billion $ N billion last month a much higher level than economists had predicted 
 in a separate speech prepared for delivery at the dinner robin <unk> bank of england governor conceded that demand pressures were even more <unk> than had been <unk> when the british economy was heating up last year 
 he added that there 's no <unk> solution to the economic woes and said tight monetary policy is the right approach 
 discussing the recent slide in stock prices the central bank governor stated that the markets now appear to have <unk> after the nasty jolt of the 190.58-point plunge in the dow jones industrial average a week ago 
 although the new york market plunge prompted a <unk> drop in the london financial times-stock exchange N share index mr. <unk> declared that the experience owed nothing to the particular problems of the british economy 
 specifically he pointed out that compared with the u.s. market the u.k. has far fewer highly leveraged junk-bond financings 
 discussing future monetary arrangements mr. lawson repeated the thatcher government 's commitment to join the exchange rate mechanism of the european monetary system but he did n't indicate when

 c. olivetti & co. claiming it has won the race in europe to introduce computers based on a powerful new microprocessor chip unveiled its <unk> computer yesterday 
 the product is the first from a european company based on intel corp. 's new <unk> <unk> microprocessor which works several times faster than previously available chips 
 hewlett-packard co. became the first company world-wide to announce a product based on the chip earlier this month but it wo n't start shipping the computers until early next year 
 an olivetti spokesman said the company 's factories are already beginning to produce the machine and that it should be available in europe by december 
 what this means is that europeans will have these machines in their offices before americans do the spokesman said 
 the new chip is a very big step in computing and it is important that olivetti be one of the first out on the market with this product said <unk> <unk> davis an analyst at james capel & co. in london 
 executives at olivetti whose earnings have been steadily sliding over the past couple of years have acknowledged that in the past they have lagged at getting new technology to market 
 ms. davis said the new machines could steal some sales away from olivetti 's own minicomputers but would bring new sales among professionals such as engineers stockbrokers and medical doctors 
 although olivetti 's profits tumbled N N in the first half of this year she believes olivetti 's restructuring last fall and its introduction of new products will begin to bear fruit with an earnings rebound next year especially if it can fulfill its promise to deliver the new machines by december 
 we think the worst is over in the european <unk> market she said 
 depending on the type of software and peripherals used the machines can serve either as the main computer in a network of many terminals a role usually filled by a <unk> as a technical workstation or as a very fast personal computer 
 it 's the missing link in olivetti 's product line between small personal computers and <unk> minicomputers the olivetti spokesman said 
 he added that olivetti will continue making its <unk> <unk> line 
 the machines will cost around $ N on average in europe 
 the intel N chip can process N million instructions per second or mips while intel 's previous N chip could handle only N to N mips 
 olivetti also plans to sell the <unk> computer in the u.s. starting next year through olivetti usa and through its <unk> <unk> unit which specializes in <unk> <unk> networks 
 <unk> inc. said it received approval from the french government for its proposed $ N million acquisition of <unk> s.a 
 the approval <unk> the remaining conditions of the purchase which is expected to close within two weeks 
 <unk> the second-largest maker of food cans in france had N sales of $ N million 
 <unk> has N workers at four <unk> manufacturing plants and one plastic container facility 
 <unk> makes flexible packaging films and machinery and materials for the food and pharmaceutical industries 
 social security benefits will rise N N next year to keep pace with inflation boosting the average monthly benefit to $ N from $ N the department of health and human services announced 
 the higher payments will start with social security checks received on jan. N N 
 supplemental security income payments to the disabled also will rise N N starting with checks received on dec. N N increasing the maximum <unk> payment to $ N from $ N a month 
 the inflation adjustment also means that the maximum annual level of earnings subject to the wage tax that generates revenue for the social security trust fund will rise to $ N in N from $ N this year 
 as mandated by law the tax rate will rise to N N in N from N N and wo n't rise any further in the future 
 this means that the maximum yearly social security tax paid by workers and employers each will rise $ N next year to $ N 
 beneficiaries aged N through N will be able to earn $ N without losing any social security benefits in N up from $ N this year 
 the exempt amount for beneficiaries under N will rise to $ N from $ N 
 the adjustments reflect the increase in the consumer price index for urban wage <unk> and <unk> workers from the third quarter of last year to the third quarter of this year 
 health-care companies should get <unk> in the third quarter 
 <unk> houses are expected to report earnings increases of about N N on average for the third quarter despite sales increases of less than N N analysts say 
 to offset sluggish sales growth companies have been cutting staff mostly through <unk> and slowing the growth in research and development spending 
 sales growth in the quarter was slowed by mounting pressure from groups of buyers such as hospitals to hold down prices 
 suppliers were also hurt by the stronger u.s. dollar which makes sales abroad more difficult 
 in some cases competition has squeezed margins 
 <unk> <unk> & co. for example faces stiff competition from a japanese supplier in the important <unk> market 
 the franklin <unk> n.j. company is expected to report sales growth of only N N to N N but should still maintain earnings growth of N N says jerry e. <unk> an analyst with duff & phelps inc 
 among the first of the group to post results <unk> laboratories said third-quarter net income jumped N N to $ N million or N cents a share from $ N million or N cents a share a year earlier 
 sales for the company based in <unk> park ill. rose N N to $ N billion from $ N billion 
 <unk> international inc. yesterday reported net climbed N N in the third period to $ N million or N cents a share from $ N million or N cents a share a year earlier 
 sales for the <unk> ill. company rose N N to $ N billion from $ N billion 
 but not every company expects to report increased earnings 
 <unk> <unk> inc. yesterday said third-quarter net plunged N N to $ N million or N cents a share from $ N million or N cents a share a year earlier 
 sales fell N N to $ N million from $ N million 
 the murray hill n.j. company said full-year earnings may be off N cents a share because the company removed a <unk> from the market 
 in N the company earned $ N a share 
 the food and drug administration had raised questions about the device 's design 
 some analysts add that <unk> pressures to reduce health costs will continue to <unk> companies ' bottom lines 
 takeover speculation which has been <unk> stocks of supply houses may also ease says peter <unk> an analyst with drexel burnham lambert inc 
 as that <unk> you 're going to see the stocks probably <unk> as well he says 
 hospitals companies meanwhile are reporting improved earnings 
 bolstered by strong performances by its psychiatric hospitals national medical enterprises inc. los angeles reported net income of $ N million or N cents a share for the first quarter ended aug. N up from $ N million or N cents a share a year earlier 
 humana inc. louisville ky. also reported favorable results with net income of $ N million or N cents in the fourth quarter ended aug. N up from $ N million or N cents a year earlier 
 analysts say the handful of hospital companies that are still publicly traded are benefiting from several trends 
 most important hospital admission rates are stabilizing after several years of decline 
 moreover companies have sold off many of their smaller <unk> hospitals and have completed painful restructurings 
 humana 's revenues for example are being boosted by large increases in <unk> in the company 's health maintenance organizations 
 says <unk> richter an analyst with dean witter reynolds the <unk> in the publicly traded companies is over 
 initial claims for regular state unemployment benefits rose to a seasonally adjusted N during the week ended oct. N from N the previous week the labor department said 
 the number of people receiving regular state benefits in the week ended sept. N decreased to a seasonally adjusted N or N N of those covered by unemployment insurance from N the previous week when the insured unemployment rate also was N N 
 counting all state and federal benefit programs the number of people receiving unemployment benefits in the week ended sept. N fell to N from N a week earlier 
 these figures are n't seasonally adjusted 
 a labor department spokesman said the unusually high number of initial claims for state unemployment benefits reflects the impact of hurricane hugo on southern states particularly north carolina and south carolina 
 the figure also may reflect initial claims filed by striking nynex corp. workers who have become eligible for unemployment benefits the official said 
 digital equipment corp. reported a N N decline in net income on a modest revenue gain in its fiscal first quarter causing some analysts to predict weaker results ahead than they had expected 
 although the second-largest computer maker had prepared wall street for a poor quarter analysts said they were troubled by signs of flat u.s. orders and a slowdown in the rate of gain in foreign orders 
 the maynard mass. company is in a transition in which it is trying to reduce its reliance on <unk> machines and establish a presence in workstations and mainframes 
 net for the quarter ended sept. N fell to $ N million or $ N a share from $ N million or $ N a share a year ago 
 revenue rose N N to $ N billion from $ N billion 
 digital said a shift in its product mix toward <unk> products and strong growth in workstation sales yielded lower gross margins 
 a spokesman also said margins for the company 's service business narrowed somewhat because of heavy investments made in that sector 
 the lack of a strong product at the high end of digital 's line was a significant drag on sales 
 digital hopes to address that with the debut of its first <unk> computers next tuesday 
 the new line is aimed directly at international business machines corp 
 until the new mainframe products kick in there wo n't be a lot of revenue contribution at the high end and that 's hurt us said mark <unk> digital 's director of investor relations 
 he said unfavorable currency <unk> were also a factor in the quarter 
 dec shares rose $ N to $ N apiece in consolidated new york stock exchange trading yesterday 
 but analysts said that against the backdrop of a nearly <unk> rise in the dow jones industrial average that should n't necessarily be taken as a sign of great strength 
 some cut their earnings estimates for the stock this year and predicted more efforts to control costs ahead 
 i think the next few quarters will be difficult said steven <unk> of first boston 
 margins will remain under pressure and when the new mainframe does ship i 'm not sure it will be a big winner 
 mr. <unk> said he was <unk> his estimate for dec 's current year from $ N a share to well below $ N although he has n't settled on a final number 
 one troubling aspect of dec 's results analysts said was its performance in europe 
 dec said its overseas business which now accounts for more than half of sales improved in the quarter 
 it even took the unusually frank step of telling analysts in a morning conference call that orders in europe were up in double <unk> in foreign-currency terms 
 that gain probably translated into about N N to N N in dollar terms well below recent quarters ' gains of above N N <unk> jay stevens of dean witter reynolds 
 that was a disappointment and a sign of overall <unk> softness in europe mr. stevens said 
 marc <unk> with <unk> securities in new york dropped his estimate of dec 's full-year net to $ N a share from $ N 
 although overall revenues were stronger mr. <unk> said dec drew down its european backlog and had flat world-wide orders overall 
 the bottom line is that it 's more hand to mouth than it has been before he said 
 mr. <unk> said he believes that the <unk> of dec 's new mainframe will occur somewhat more <unk> than many of his investment colleagues expect 
 he said current expectations are for an entry level machine to be shipped in december with all of the more sophisticated versions out by june 
 for reasons he would n't elaborate on he said he 's sure that schedule wo n't be met meaning less profit impact from the product for dec in the next few quarters

 colgate <unk> co. reported third-quarter net income rose N N bolstered by strong sales in its latin american business and surprisingly healthy profits from u.s. operations 
 colgate said net income for the quarter rose to $ N million or $ N a share on sales that increased N N to $ N billion 
 in the year-earlier period colgate posted net income of $ N million or N cents a share 
 last year 's results included earnings from discontinued operations of $ N million or N cents a share 
 <unk> mark chairman and chief executive officer of colgate said earnings growth was fueled by strong sales in latin america the far east and europe 
 results were also bolstered by a very meaningful increase in operating profit at colgate 's u.s. business he said 
 operating profit at colgate 's u.s. household products and personal care businesses which include such well-known brands as colgate <unk> and <unk> <unk> detergent jumped more than N N the company said 
 mr. mark attributed the improvement to cost savings achieved by consolidating manufacturing operations <unk> together two sales organizations and more carefully focusing the company 's promotional activities 
 we 've done a lot to improve u.s. results and a lot more will be done mr. mark said 
 improving profitability of u.s. operations is an extremely high priority in the company 
 colgate 's results were at the high end of the range of analysts ' forecasts 
 the scope of the improvement in the u.s. business caught some analysts by surprise 
 the company 's domestic business especially its household products division has performed poorly for years 
 analysts say the earnings improvement came from cutting costs rather than increasing sales 
 for the nine months net increased N N to $ N million or $ N a share 
 sales rose N N to $ N billion 
 the company earned $ N million or $ N a share in the year-earlier period 
 colgate 's N net income included $ N million or N cents a share from discontinued operations 
 colgate sold its hospital supply and home health care business last year 
 separately colgate wednesday <unk> an agreement with <unk> corp. a tiny <unk> products and pharmaceutical concern based in <unk> mass. to market in the u.s. four of <unk> 's <unk> <unk> products 
 the products <unk> and <unk> materials used by <unk> all contain <unk> that is released over time 
 the move is part of a drive to increase colgate 's business with <unk> a company spokeswoman said 
 terms of the agreement were n't given 
 <unk> limited partnership said it completed the sale of its <unk> restaurant franchise system to a subsidiary of metromedia co. for $ N million in cash 
 <unk> which is nearly <unk> by sam and charles <unk> of dallas said it will distribute proceeds from the sale to unit holders as a <unk> dividend as soon as possible 
 the <unk> franchise system which generates about $ N million in sales annually represented substantially all of the partnership 's assets 
 the sale of the system has been challenged in a class-action suit on behalf of unit holders filed last week in a delaware court <unk> said 
 the company said it believes the suit is without merit 
 american telephone & telegraph co. unveiled a sweetened pension and <unk> program for management that it hopes will enable it to save $ N million in the next year 
 at&t also said net income rose N N in the third quarter 
 at&t said its amended pension program will nearly double to N the number of managers eligible to retire with immediate pension payments 
 at&t said that based on studies of other companies that have offered retirement plans it expects about one-third of its eligible managers to retire under the new program 
 at&t said third-quarter net income grew despite stiff competition in all of the company 's markets 
 net income rose to $ N million or N cents a share from the year-earlier $ N million or N cents a share 
 revenue edged up to $ N billion from $ N billion 
 the latest period 's net was reduced $ N million or nine cents a share for a change in depreciation method and <unk> changes in estimates of <unk> lives and net salvage for certain telecommunications equipment 
 the results roughly matched estimates of securities analysts who were encouraged by at&t increasing its operating margin to N N from N N a year ago because of continued cost-cutting efforts 
 sales of long-distance services an extremely competitive market rose N N 
 but the growth was partly offset by lower equipment sales and <unk> and price cuts on some products 
 under the amended pension program at&t managers who have at least five years of service will have five years added to their age and length of service for pension purposes 
 managers who retire dec. N will have an additional N N added to their monthly pension for as long as five years or age N whichever comes earlier 
 an at&t spokeswoman said the company would likely replace about one-third of its managers who choose to retire with new employees 
 analysts hailed the sweetened pension package which they said had been the subject of rumors for several months 
 this tells you at&t is serious about continuing to manage their cost structure and is committed to <unk> earnings growth said jack <unk> an analyst with painewebber inc 
 but other analysts expressed disappointment that the cost-cutting move wo n't result in even greater earnings growth 
 this is a good move but it only gets you to where people 's expectations already are in terms of earnings growth said joel d. gross an analyst with donaldson lufkin & jenrette 
 mr. gross said he had hoped that a cost savings of $ N million would result in even greater growth than the N N annual earnings increase at&t has told analysts it expects in the future 
 at&t said the special retirement option will increase fourth-quarter expenses 
 but the company said the amount ca n't be determined until it knows how many managers <unk> to retire 
 at&t said the expense increase will be largely offset by a gain from its previously announced plan to swap its holdings in <unk> c. olivetti & co. for shares in cie <unk> <unk> an italian holding company 
 for the nine months at&t said net income was $ N billion or $ N a share up N N from $ N billion or $ N a share 
 revenue gained N N to $ N billion from $ N billion 
 in composite trading yesterday on the new york stock exchange at&t shares closed at $ N up N cents 
 when it comes to buying and selling shares westridge capital management inc. takes a back seat to no one 
 every dollar 's worth of stock in the los angeles money manager 's portfolio is traded seven or eight times a year the firm estimates 
 that makes it the most active trader among all the nation 's investment advisers according to securities and exchange commission filings 
 but wait a second 
 westridge capital is an index fund the type of <unk> long-term investor whose goal is to be nothing more than average 
 westridge capital 's <unk> trading reflects the changes sweeping through the previously <unk> world of indexing 
 indexing for the most part has involved simply buying and then holding stocks in the correct mix to mirror a stock market barometer such as standard & poor 's 500-stock index and match its performance 
 institutional investors have poured $ N billion into stock and bond indexing as a cheap and easy form of investment management that promises to post average market returns 
 these big investors have <unk> to indexing because relatively few active stock pickers have been able to consistently match the returns of the s&p N or other <unk> much less beat it 
 and the fees investors pay for indexing run a few pennies for each $ N of assets a fraction of the cost of active managers 
 that 's because computers do most of the work and low trading activity keeps a lid on commission costs 
 but today indexing is moving from a passive investment strategy to an increasingly active one 
 because <unk> managers are no longer satisfied with merely being average they have developed enhanced indexing strategies that are intended to outperform the market as much as three percentage points 
 indexing has been the most single successful investment concept in the last decade but the index money has been just sort of sitting there says <unk> m. lynn president of <unk> core investors inc. an <unk> based in <unk> n.y 
 now the interest is in what else can i do with that money 
 among the <unk> indexing strategies <unk> portfolios can be built around thousands of stocks or just a few dozen rather than being restricted to the s&p N companies 
 they can ignore the s&p N stocks altogether and focus on particular types of stocks such as smaller companies those paying high dividends or companies in a particular industry state or country 
 with today 's computer-driven program trading techniques index funds can trade back and forth between stock-index futures and the actual stocks making up indexes such as the s&p N 
 futures and options also make it possible to build synthetic index funds that do n't actually own a single share of stock but can produce returns that match or exceed the broad stock market 
 one reason for these <unk> is that indexing 's rapid growth is slowing particularly for those plain <unk> funds that mirror the s&p N 
 there is n't a <unk> of big investors out there still waiting to get into indexing says p. james <unk> vice president of <unk> investment management co. chicago which offers both indexing and active management services 
 after <unk> in size in the past five years index funds now hold about N N of the stock owned by pension funds 
 a further problem is <unk> profits 
 <unk> funds have become so <unk> that fees they can charge have plunged to almost nothing and in some cases are just that 
 to land customers for their <unk> stock <unk> business big banks sometimes will throw in basic indexing services for free 
 it 's like getting a free <unk> when you open an account says <unk> core 's mr. lynn 
 as a result <unk> have been looking for ways to give investors something more than the average for their money 
 and many have been successful as in the case of the index fund operated by <unk> westridge capital 
 westridge capital has used enhanced indexing techniques to beat the s&p N 's returns by N to N percentage points over the past four years with the same risk level as holding the s&p N stocks according to james <unk> the firm 's president 
 strategies vary for westridge capital which has $ N million under management 
 the firm sometimes buys s&p N futures when they are selling at a discount to the actual stocks and will switch back and forth between stocks and stock-index futures to take advantages of any <unk> price <unk> 
 mr. <unk> also goes through periods when he buys stocks in <unk> with options to boost returns and protect against declines 
 and in some months he buys stock-index futures and not stocks at all 
 by their nature our trades are very short-term and are going to create high turnover mr. <unk> adds 
 the more turnover the better for our clients 
 big <unk> bankers trust co. also uses futures in a strategy that on average has added one percentage point to its enhanced fund 's returns 
 j. thomas allen president of <unk> advanced investment management inc. agrees it 's a good idea to jump between the s&p N stocks and futures 
 you 're buying the s&p and you always want to hold the cheapest form of it he says 
 but some <unk> make little or no use of futures saying that these instruments present added risks for investors 
 if the futures markets have a problem then those products could have a problem says john <unk> managing director of prudential insurance co. of america 's investment index technologies inc. unit 
 prudential currently is seeking approval to offer a new fund offering a return equal to the s&p N index plus N of a percentage point 
 an added feature is that the <unk> improved return would be guaranteed by prudential 
 there are many other strategies to bolster the returns of index funds 
 they include 
 limited risk funds 
 these guarantee protection against stock market declines while still passing along most gains 
 here a fund may promise to pay back say $ N of every $ N invested for a year even if the market goes much lower 
 the fund could invest $ N for one year in treasury bills yielding N N to return the guaranteed $ N 
 that leaves $ N which could be used to buy s&p N options that will nearly match any gain in the s&p index 
 manager <unk> funds 
 say a big investor is interested in growth stocks 
 instead of hiring one of the many active managers specializing in growth stocks <unk> can design a portfolio around the same stocks the portfolio will be maintained by computer reducing both fees and in theory risk because of the large number of stocks 
 we see a lot of interest in those kind of things says frank <unk> a vice president of bankers trust 
 people comfortable with the passive approach are using them for other strategies 
 tilt funds 
 this is an index fund with a bet 
 instead of <unk> the s&p N or some other index exactly some stocks are <unk> or <unk> in the portfolio 
 one simple approach is to exclude s&p N companies considered bankruptcy candidates this can avoid weak <unk> but also can hurt when a company like chrysler corp. <unk> 
 another approach an investor with $ N million might use $ N million to buy the s&p N index and spend the other $ N million on a favorite group of stocks 
 specialized funds 
 indexes can be constructed to serve social goals such as eliminating the stocks of companies doing business in south africa 
 other funds have been designed to concentrate on stocks in a geographic area in order to encourage local investment 
 pennsylvania state employees retirement system for example has about $ N million invested in a fund of N companies that are either <unk> or have N N of their work forces in the state 
 short interest on the new york stock exchange declined for the second consecutive month this time N N while the american stock exchange reported its third consecutive record month of short interest 
 the big board reported that short interest dropped to N shares as of oct. N from N shares in <unk> 
 amex short interest climbed N N to N shares from N shares 
 for the year-earlier month the big board reported N shares indicating a N N year-to-year rise while the amex reported N shares a N N leap 
 amex short interest has been heading upward since <unk> with increases in each month since then except at <unk> 
 traders who sell short borrow stock and sell it betting that the stock 's price will decline and that they can buy the shares back later at a lower price for return to the lender 
 short interest is the number of shares that have n't yet been purchased for return to lenders 
 although a substantial short position reflects heavy speculation that a stock 's price will decline some investors consider an increase in short interest bullish because the borrowed shares eventually must be bought back 
 <unk> in short interest of certain stocks also may be caused partly by <unk> 
 the figures occasionally include incomplete transactions in restricted stock 
 the level of negative sentiment measured by the big board short interest ratio slipped to N from last month 's N 
 the ratio is the number of trading days at the exchange 's average trading volume that would be required to convert the total short interest position 
 some analysts suggest however that the ratio has weakened in value as an indicator because options and other products can be used to hedge short positions 
 <unk> corp. led the big board list of largest short volumes with N shares 
 <unk> has proposed to acquire <unk> corp. consisting of the auto parts division and some debt of <unk> corp. for $ N million of cash and securities 
 chemical waste management posted the biggest increase in short volume on the new york exchange up N shares to N 
 bristol-myers squibb co. the entity formed from the recent acquisition of squibb corp. by bristol-myers co. <unk> the largest volume decline N shares to N 
 short interest in international business machines corp. plunged to N shares from N shares a month earlier 
 also closely watched is exxon corp. where short interest slid to N shares from N 
 on a percentage basis germany fund inc. led the gainers leaping to N shares from three shares 
 transcanada pipelines ltd. led the percentage decliners dropping to N shares from N 
 the amex short interest volume leader again was texas air corp. rising to N shares from N 
 <unk> pharmaceutical co. posted the largest volume increase N shares to N 
 the company is under an investigation concerning procedures to gain food and drug administration approval of generic drugs 
 <unk> has denied any wrongdoing 
 the largest volume drop down N shares to N came in shares represented by b.a.t industries plc 's american depositary receipts 
 the company is facing a takeover proposal from the financier sir james goldsmith 
 first <unk> fund led the percentage increases rising to N shares from N 
 nelson holdings international ltd. dropped the most on a percentage basis to N shares from N

 your oct. N editorial <unk> <unk> presidency <unk> states that i was critical of the bush administration 's failure to have any plan in place to respond in a timely fashion to the opportunities to oust manuel noriega presented by the attempted military coup on oct. N 
 you are absolutely wrong however in <unk> that this position is some kind of <unk> something newly arrived at as a result of reading the opinion polls 
 my position is one founded on both the facts and the law 
 although you may have forgotten public opinion about gen. noriega is where it is in large measure because of my investigation of his years of involvement in narcotics <unk> and simultaneous work as a u.s. <unk> 
 the public made up its mind about gen. noriega largely as a result of the hearings i <unk> in the subcommittee on terrorism and narcotics of the foreign relations committee on feb. N N N and N N and again on april N N 
 it was during those hearings that the nation first learned the <unk> and <unk> of gen. noriega 's <unk> and of his <unk> relationships with a variety of u.s. government agencies 
 those hearings also <unk> how gen. noriega was able to use his relationships with these agencies to delay u.s. action against him and to exploit the administration 's <unk> with <unk> the sandinistas to protect his own <unk> 
 as former ambassador to costa rica francis j. <unk> testified before the subcommittee the reagan administration knew that gen. noriega was involved with narcotics but made a decision in the summer of N to put gen. noriega on the shelf until nicaragua was settled 
 as the report issued by the subcommittee concluded our government did nothing regarding gen. noriega 's drug business and substantial criminal involvement because the first priority was the contra war 
 this decision resulted in at least some drugs entering the united states as a hidden cost of the war 
 unfortunately this problem continued even after gen. noriega 's indictment 
 throughout N and this year i and others in congress have pressed the u.s. to develop a plan for pushing this <unk> out of panama

 nguyen van chan is living proof that old ways die hard 
 mr. chan used to be an <unk> in <unk> a private entrepreneur 
 his business success made him an official target in <unk> days 
 mr. chan now N years old invented a <unk> <unk> he and his family produced from plastic waste 
 later he marketed <unk> 
 both products were <unk> popular 
 for his troubles mr. chan was jailed three times between N and N 
 though his operation was registered and used only scrap he was accused of conducting illegal business and <unk> illegal materials 
 once he was held for three months without being charged 
 things were supposed to change when vietnam 's economic reforms gathered pace and for <unk> they did 
 after years of <unk> mr. chan produced a <unk> bicycle tire that <unk> its <unk> rival

 newspapers published articles about him and he was hailed as the tire king 
 his efforts earned a gold <unk> at a national exhibition and attracted renewed attention from local authorities 
 district police in N <unk> on his suburban home which he and his large family used as both residence and factory and demanded proof the house and equipment were his

 the editor 
 nguyen <unk> seemed an obvious choice when the vietnamese writers association was looking for a new editor to reform its weekly newspaper van <unk> 
 after the sixth congress journalists seized the opportunity provided by the <unk> to probe previously <unk> subjects 
 mr. <unk> N years old had solid <unk> credentials he had lost his official position in the association in he early 1980s because he questioned the <unk> of politics into literature 
 appointed editor in chief in july N mr. <unk> rapidly turned the <unk> van <unk> into vietnam 's hottest paper 
 circulation soared as the weekly went way beyond standard literary themes to cover vietnamese society and its <unk> 
 readers were <unk> by the paper 's <unk> and <unk> by the dark side of life it uncovered 
 one article <unk> a <unk> struggle by a <unk> <unk> to prove officially he was alive 
 another described how <unk> officials in <unk> <unk> province one night <unk> through homes and confiscated rice from <unk> <unk> 
 the newspaper also ran a series of controversial short stories by nguyen <unk> <unk> a former history teacher who <unk> debate over his interpretation of vietnamese culture and took a <unk> <unk> <unk> at writers who had blocked his entry into their official association 
 van <unk> quickly made influential enemies 
 those who manage <unk> and a large number of writers reacted badly to the <unk> paper says <unk> nguyen an a literary critic 
 after months of internal <unk> mr. <unk> was fired last december 
 his dismissal triggered a furor among intellectuals that continues today

 mrs. thi did n't wait for the reforms to get her start 
 she charged ahead of the government and the law to establish <unk> city food co. as the biggest rice dealer in the country 
 her success which included <unk> an urban food shortage in the early 1980s helped persuade <unk> to take the reform path 
 her story is becoming part of local <unk>

 actually <unk> mrs. thi is about as poor as almost everyone else in this <unk> land 
 she has indeed turned <unk> city food into a <unk> conglomerate but the company itself remains state-owned 
 she manages it with the title of <unk> 
 the heart of the business is the purchase of rice and other commodities such as corn and coffee from farmers in the south paying with fertilizer farm tools and other items 
 last year <unk> city food says it bought two million metric tons of <unk> rice more than N N of the country 's output 
 the company operates a fleet of trucks and <unk> to transport the commodities to its warehouses 
 a subsidiary company processes commodities into foods such as instant <unk> that are sold with the rice through a vast retail network

 the revenue will be regained in the current period he added 
 there are no plans to <unk> a common stock dividend mr. johnson said explaining that the board continues to believe shareholders are best served by <unk> excess cash 
 mr. johnson said the first-quarter loss also heavily reflected a rapid change in graphics technology that left <unk> channels with too many of the old computer graphics boards and too few new monitors compatible with the new graphics boards 
 western digital does n't make the monitors 
 an accelerating move by personal computer manufacturers ' to include advanced graphics <unk> as standard equipment further <unk> <unk> purchases of western digital 's equipment 
 the other areas of the business storage and <unk> were very good mr. johnson said 
 he said western digital has reacted swiftly to the movement to video graphics array <unk> graphics technology from the old enhanced graphics <unk> <unk> which has a lower resolution standard technology and now is one of the leading producers of these newer units 
 other makers of video <unk> equipment also were caught in the <unk> shift he said but we were able to respond much more quickly 
 still mr. johnson said our stock is grossly undervalued 
 he said the company has cut operating expenses by about N N over the last few quarters while maintaining research and development at about N N to N N of sales 
 as part of its reorganization this week western digital has divided its business into two segments storage products including controllers and disk drives and <unk> products which include graphics communications and peripheral control chips 
 graphics communications and peripheral control chips were combined because increasingly multiple functions are being <unk> by a single chip

 disk drives which allow a computer to access its memory generated N N more revenue in the most recent period compared with the fiscal first quarter a year earlier 
 computer parts are getting ever smaller mr. johnson said a shrinking that has propelled <unk> into position as the fastest-growing segment of the computer business 
 as smaller and more powerful computers continue to be the focus of the industry he said western digital is strengthening development of laptop parts 
 next year western digital plans to consolidate its operations from N buildings in irvine into two buildings in the same city a new headquarters and a block away a modern $ N million silicon <unk> fabrication plant

 domestic lending for real estate and property development was the source of bank bumiputra malaysia <unk> 's most recent spate of financial troubles the institution 's executive chairman <unk> basir <unk> said 
 speaking to reporters this week after bank bumiputra 's shareholders approved a rescue plan <unk> sri basir said heavy lending to the property sector rocked the bank when property prices in malaysia plummeted in N 
 he said the bank could n't wait any longer for prices to recover and for borrowers to service their loans 
 so the bank 's board decided to make N billion <unk> dollars us$ N million in provisions for interest payments from loans previously recorded as revenue but never actually received by the bank and to submit a bailout package to <unk> the bank 's <unk> capital 
 the <unk> he added was similar to the hong kong N <unk> collapse which exposed the involvement of bank bumiputra 's former subsidiary in the colony in the largest banking scandal in malaysia 's history

 when the supreme court opened the door this year to new restrictions on abortion ms. <unk> opened her mind to democratic politics

 now she leads a <unk> abortion-rights campaign in <unk> county for pro-choice democratic gubernatorial candidate james florio 
 this is one where i cross party lines she says rejecting the anti-abortion stance of rep. florio 's opponent <unk> rep. james courter 
 people my age thought it was n't going to be an issue 
 now it has especially for people my age 
 polls bear out this warning but after a decade of increased republican influence here the new politics of abortion have contributed to a world turned upside down for mr. courter 
 unless he closes the gap republicans risk losing not only the <unk> but also the assembly next month 
 going into the 1990s the gop is paying a price for the same conservative social agenda that it used to <unk> democrats in the past 
 this change comes less from a shift in public opinion which has n't changed much on abortion over the past decade than in the <unk> of the debate 
 new jersey 's own highest court remains a liberal <unk> against major restrictions on abortion but the u.s. supreme court ruling webster vs. missouri has engaged voters across the nation who had been <unk> from the issue 
 before july pro-choice voters could <unk> make political decisions without focusing narrowly on abortion 
 now the threat of further restrictions adds a new <unk> bringing an <unk> in political activity by abortion-rights forces 
 a recent pro-choice rally in <unk> drew thousands and in a major reversal congress is <unk> a presidential veto and demanding that medicaid abortions be permitted in cases of rape and incest 
 if webster had n't happened you would n't be here linda <unk> tells a reporter in the <unk> office of the national organization for women 
 we could have shouted from the <unk> about courter and no one would have heard us 
 new jersey is a proving ground for this aggressive <unk> movement this year 
 the <unk> of activists can bring a clash of <unk>

 a matching <unk> star <unk> poll last month showed a complete reversal 
 voters in the same age group backed democrat florio N N to N N over republican courter 
 abortion alone ca n't explain this shift but new jersey is a model of how so personal an issue can become a baseline of sorts in judging a candidate 
 by a <unk> ratio voters appear more at ease with mr. florio 's stance on abortion and polls indicate his lead widens when the candidates are specifically linked to the issue 
 the times are my times says mr. florio 
 the <unk> county congressman still carries himself with a trademark <unk> intensity but at a <unk> in newark 's columbus day parade recently he was <unk> with his wife in the middle of the avenue in the city 's old <unk> ward 
 after losing by fewer than N votes in the N governor 's race he has prepared himself <unk> for this moment including deciding in recent years he could no longer support curbs on federal funding for medicaid abortions 
 if you 're going to be consistent and say it is a <unk> protected right he asks how are you going to say an upscale woman who can drive to the hospital or clinic in a nice car has a constitutional right and someone who is not in great shape financially does not 
 mr. courter by comparison seems a shadow of the confident <unk> who defended oliver north before national cameras at iran-contra hearings two years ago 
 looking back he says he <unk> by <unk> his personal opposition to abortion instead of <unk> voters that he would n't impose his views on policy as governor 
 it is a <unk> that <unk> neither side in the debate 
 he does n't know himself <unk> <unk> of the abortion rights league says of mr. courter 's position 
 even abortion opponents however angry with mr. florio ca n't hide their frustration with the republican 's <unk> 
 he does n't want to lead the people says richard <unk> president of new jersey right to life 
 moreover by stepping outside the state 's pro-choice tradition mr. courter <unk> fears that he is too conservative as well on more pressing concerns such as auto insurance rates and the environment 
 he hurt himself further this summer by bringing homosexual issues into the debate and by <unk> on this issue and abortion he has weakened his credibility in what is already a <unk> campaign on both sides 
 elected to congress in N the <unk> mr. courter is part of a generation of young conservatives who were once very much in the lead of the <unk> shift under mr. reagan 
 like many of his colleagues he did n't serve in vietnam in the 1960s yet embraced a <unk> defense and foreign policy even voting against a N resolution critical of the u.s. mining of nicaraguan harbors 
 jack kemp and the writers irving <unk> and george <unk> were influences and mr. courter 's own conservative credentials proved useful to the current new jersey gop governor thomas kean in the N republican primary here 
 the same partnership is now crucial to mr. courter 's fortunes but the abortion issue is only a reminder of the gap between his record and that of the more moderate pro-choice gov. kean 
 while the warren county congressman pursued an <unk> <unk> agenda in washington gov. kean was <unk> increased income and sales taxes at home and overseeing a near doubling in the size of new jersey 's budget in his eight years in office 
 kean forces play down any differences with mr. courter but this history makes it harder for the conservative to run against government 
 mr. courter 's free-market plan to bring down auto insurance rates met criticism from gov. kean 's own insurance commissioner 
 mr. courter is further <unk> by a record of votes opposed to government regulation on behalf of consumers 
 <unk> in spanish from his days in the peace corps mr. courter actively courts minority voters but seems oddly over his head 
 he is warm and <unk> before a puerto rican congress in <unk> park

 the dow jones industrial average rallied on the news closing N points higher at N 
 bond prices also jumped as traders appeared to read the data as a sign that interest rates may fall 
 but many economists were not nearly as <unk> 
 the climb in wholesale energy prices is certain to push up retail energy prices in the next few months they warned 
 they also said the dollar is <unk> off after a rise this summer that helped to reduce the prices of imported goods 
 i think inflation is going to pick up through the fall said joel <unk> a specialist on inflation who runs an economic consulting firm here 
 it has been in what i would describe as a <unk> for the past several months 
 we 've had <unk> declines in consumer energy prices in each of the past three months and at the wholesale level those are fully behind us now said jay <unk> chief domestic economist at bankers trust co. in new york 
 because wholesale energy prices shot up by a steep N N last month many analysts expected energy prices to rise at the consumer level too 
 as a result many economists were expecting the consumer price index to increase significantly more than it did 
 but retail energy prices declined N N in september 
 though analysts say competition will probably hold down increases in retail energy prices many expect some of the wholesale rise to be passed along to the consumer before the end of the year 
 still some analysts insisted that the worst of the inflation is behind 
 it increasingly appears that N was a temporary inflation <unk> and not the beginning of a cyclical inflation problem argued edward <unk> chief economist at prudential-bache securities inc. in new york 
 in both N and N consumer prices rose N N 
 a <unk> in world oil prices last winter sent consumer prices soaring at a N N annual rate in the first five months of this year but the subsequent decline in energy prices has pulled the annual rate back down to N N 
 mr. <unk> predicted that world business competition will continue to restrain prices 
 the bottom line is it seems to me that the economic environment has become very very <unk> for a lot of businesses he said 
 back in N business was operating at fairly tight capacity so businesses felt they could raise prices 
 now he said a slowdown in economic activity has <unk> demand 
 the mild inflation figures renewed investors ' hopes that the federal reserve will ease its interest-rate stance 
 the steep climb in producer prices reported last friday <unk> <unk> about lower interest rates and contributed to the stock market 's N N plunge that day 
 in the past several days however the u.s. 's central bank has allowed a key interest rate to fall slightly to try to stabilize the markets 
 analysts say fed policy makers have been wary of <unk> credit too much because they were still uncertain about the level of inflation in the economy 
 excluding the volatile categories of energy and food leaving what some economists call the core inflation rate consumer prices still rose only N N in september 
 transportation costs actually fell N N and housing costs gained only N N 
 apparel prices <unk> up N N but that was after three months of declines 
 medical costs continued their steep <unk> rising N N after four consecutive months of N N increases 
 car prices another area that contributed to the steep rise in the wholesale index last month still showed declines at the consumer level 
 they dropped N N as dealers continued to offer rebates to attract customers 
 food prices rose N N for the second month in a row far slower than the monthly rises earlier in the year 
 separately the labor department reported that average weekly earnings rose N N in september after adjusting for inflation following a N N decline in august 
 all the numbers are adjusted for seasonal fluctuations 
 here are the seasonally adjusted changes in the components of the labor department 's consumer price index for september 
 after watching interest in the sport plummet for years the ski industry is trying to give itself a lift 
 across the country resorts are using everything from <unk> to <unk> <unk> to attract new customers 
 some have built health <unk> business centers and shopping <unk> so visitors have more to do than ski 
 and this week the industry 's efforts will go national for the first time when it <unk> a $ N million advertising campaign 
 such efforts <unk> of only a few years ago are the latest attempts to revive the sagging $ N billion u.s. ski industry 
 since the start of the decade <unk> sales have grown only N N a year on average compared with N N annual growth rates in the <unk> and <unk> 
 last season <unk> sales fell for the first time in seven years 
 by some estimates nearly a fourth of all u.s. ski areas have been forced to shut down since the early '80s 
 competition and mounting insurance and equipment costs have been the <unk> of many resorts 
 but another big problem has been the aging of baby boomers 
 skiing after all has mainly been for the young and <unk> and many baby boomers have <unk> skiing or have too many family responsibilities to stick with the sport 
 in its new ad campaign created by d'arcy <unk> benton & <unk> inc. chicago the ski industry is trying to change its image as a sport primarily for young white people 
 one <unk> tv spot features a diverse group of skiers <unk> <unk> down <unk> <unk> senior citizens minorities families with children even a blind <unk> 
 ski school is great <unk> out a <unk> <unk> in a <unk> as he <unk> down a bunny <unk> 
 you 'll never know <unk> you try says a black <unk> 
 we used to show some <unk> <unk> in his <unk> or <unk> going over the edge of a <unk> says <unk> <unk> a spokeswoman for the united ski industries association the trade group <unk> the campaign 
 ski promotions have traditionally avoided the touchy issue of safety 
 but the new commercials deal with it indirectly by showing a woman smiling as she tries to get up from a fall 
 we wanted to show it 's <unk> if you fall says ms. <unk> 
 most people think if you slip you 'll wind up in a body cast 
 the ad campaign represents an unusual spirit of cooperation among resorts and ski equipment makers normally they only run ads <unk> their own products and facilities 
 but in these crunch times for the ski industry some resorts such as the <unk> fire red river and <unk> ski areas in new mexico have even started <unk> skiers to each other 's <unk> and next year plan to sell tickets good for all local <unk> 
 many resorts also are focusing more on the service side of their business 
 since N N of skiers are parents many <unk> are building <unk> expanding ski schools and adding entertainment for kids 
 <unk> colo. now has a <unk> that looks like an old mining town kids can ski through and pan for fool 's gold 
 for $ N they can enjoy their own <unk> entertainment with dinner without mom and <unk> 
 a few years ago parents usually had to hire a <unk> or take turns skiing while one spouse stayed with the children 
 most parents who had to go through that never came back says michael shannon president of <unk> associates inc. which owns and operates the <unk> and nearby <unk> creek resorts 
 to make skiing more convenient for <unk> visitors several resorts are buying or starting their own travel agencies 
 in one phone call ski <unk> can make hotel and restaurant reservations buy lift tickets rent ski equipment and sign up for <unk> 
 and resorts are adding other <unk> such as <unk> restaurants health <unk> and vacation packages with a twist 
 during winter carnival week for example visitors at sunday river in maine can take a <unk> balloon ride 
 people these days want something else to do besides ski and sit in the bar says don <unk> executive director of <unk> fire n.m. 's chamber of commerce 
 the ski industry hopes to increase the number of skiers by N million to about N million in the next five years with its latest ads and promotions 
 but some think that 's being overly optimistic 
 for one thing it may be tough to attract people because skiing is still expensive a lift ticket can cost up to $ N a day and equipment prices are rising 
 and most <unk> still prefer a warm climate for their winter <unk> 
 an american express co. survey of its travel agents revealed that only N N believe their clients will pick a trip this winter based on the availability of winter sports as opposed to N N who think that <unk> sports will be the deciding factor 
 even if they could bring in that many new skiers i do n't know if the industry could handle that kind of an increase says i. william berry editor and publisher of the ski industry letter in <unk> n.y 
 most people will come on the weekend the <unk> will be <unk> and then these new skiers wo n't come back 
 they did n't play the third game of the world series on tuesday night as scheduled and they did n't play it on wednesday or thursday either 
 but you knew that did n't you 
 they are supposed to play the game next tuesday in candlestick park here 
 the theory is that the stadium damaged by tuesday 's earthquake will be repaired by then and that people will be able to get there 
 like just about everything else that remains to be seen 
 aftershocks could intervene 
 but at least the law of averages should have swung to the favorable side 
 it may seem <unk> to worry about the world series amid the destruction to the bay area <unk> by tuesday 's quake but the name of this column is on sports so i feel obliged to do so 
 you might be interested to know that baseball not survival appeared to be the first thought of most of the crowd of <unk> that had gathered at candlestick at N p.m. tuesday a half-hour before game time when the quake struck 
 as soon as the tremor passed many people <unk> arose and cheered as though it had been a novel kind of <unk> show 
 one fan <unk> several rows in front of the open <unk> <unk> press section where i was <unk> faced the assembled <unk> and <unk> shouted we arranged that just for you guys 
 i thought and i 'm sure others did you should n't have bothered 
 i 'd <unk> through my only previous <unk> with natural disaster a <unk> N or so <unk> ago near <unk> city mich. so i was <unk> for one reaction to such things the urge to talk about them 
 perhaps <unk> by the daily diet of radio and tv reporters <unk> <unk> into people 's faces and asking how they feel about one <unk> or another fellow reporters and <unk> who <unk> my press <unk> were eager to <unk> 
 it felt like i was on a station platform and a train went by said one man describing my own reaction 
 a women said she saw the park 's light standards <unk> 
 a man said he saw the upper <unk> <unk> 
 i saw neither 
 <unk> of good sense to the contrary not <unk> the general <unk> was to believe that the <unk> would be brief and that ball would be played 
 i was near the top of the stadium and saw a steel <unk> <unk> six feet from where i sat but i stayed put for N or N minutes confessed a friend 
 i guess i thought this is the world series and i 'm not <unk> <unk> <unk> out 
 here in the global village though folks do not stay <unk> for long 
 electrical power was out in <unk> candlestick park but <unk> <unk> and television sets were <unk> 
 within a few minutes the true extent of the catastrophe was becoming clear 
 its richter scale measurement was reported as N then N then N 
 a section of the bay bridge had collapsed as had a part of interstate highway N in oakland 
 people had died 
 at N p.m. scheduled game time having passed some fans <unk> let 's play ball 
 no longer innocent they qualified as <unk> 
 the stadium was ordered <unk> soon afterward the announcement made over police <unk> cited the power <unk> but it later was revealed that there also had been damage of the sort reported by my friend 
 outside i spotted two young men <unk> blocks of concrete 
 pieces of candlestick they said 
 the crowd remained good <unk> even <unk> 
 tv reporters interviewed fans in the parking lots while a few feet away others watched the interviews on their portable tvs 
 the only frenzy i saw was commercial <unk> selling world series <unk> <unk> and dated <unk> were besieged by fledgling speculators who saw future profit in the items 
 the traffic <unk> out of the park was <unk> 
 it took me a half-hour to move N feet from my parking spot in an outer lot to an <unk> and an additional hour to reach an inner roadway a <unk> away 
 the <unk> trip to my airport hotel that had taken N minutes earlier in the day took more than three hours 
 at my hotel the <unk> power was out some interior <unk> had broken loose and there had been water damage but little else 
 with <unk> <unk> a hotel across the street the <unk> had been hit harder a large sheet of its concrete <unk> and several window <unk> were torn away 
 the <unk> staff had <unk> set out <unk> <unk> in the <unk> prepared a <unk> buffet and passed around <unk> and <unk> 
 i fell <unk> on the lobby floor next to a man wearing a chicago cubs <unk> 
 i expected him to say i told you so but he already was <unk> 
 the <unk> consensus was that the earthquake made the world series seem <unk> 
 my response was that sports rarely are important only <unk> and the quake merely <unk> that fact 
 should the rest of the series be played at all 
 sure 
 the quake and baseball were n't related unlike the massacre of athletes that attended the N olympics 
 that heavily <unk> event learned nothing from the <unk> experience and seems doomed to repeat it 
 two <unk> <unk> 
 this has been widely dubbed the bart series after the local subway line and the bay bridge series 
 flags fly at <unk> for the death of bart <unk> the late baseball commissioner and now the bay bridge lies in <unk> 
 a series that was shaping up as the <unk> since the <unk> <unk> diego go of N has become <unk> in the least <unk> way 
 still its edge is lost 
 it now will be played mostly for the record and should be <unk> up as quickly as possible without off days 
 and i will never again complain about a <unk> 
 the disarray in the junk-bond market that began last month with a credit crunch at campeau corp. has offered commercial banks a golden opportunity to play a greater role in financing billion-dollar takeovers 
 but two big new york banks seem to have kicked those chances away for the moment with the embarrassing failure of citicorp and chase manhattan corp. to deliver $ N billion in bank financing for a leveraged buy-out of united airlines parent ual corp 
 for more than a decade banks have been pressing congress and banking regulators for expanded powers to act like securities firms in playing wall street 's lucrative takeover game from giving mergers advice all the way to selling and trading high-yield junk bonds 
 those expanded powers reached their zenith in july when bankers trust new york corp. provided mergers advice an equity investment and bank loans for the $ N billion leveraged buy-out of northwest airlines parent nwa inc 
 one of the major selling points used by los angeles financier alfred <unk> in getting the takeover approved was that the deal did n't include any junk bonds 
 that was seen as an advantage in lobbying airline employees and washington regulators for approval of the contested takeover 
 all $ N billion in debt for the deal was supplied by banks 
 charles nathan <unk> of mergers and acquisitions at salomon brothers inc. says it is natural for banks to try to expand beyond their bread-and-butter business of providing senior debt for buy-outs 
 but the ual collapse he says may tell you it 's not going to work that easily 
 david <unk> a mergers adviser in la jolla calif. who aided los angeles investor marvin davis on the bids which put both ual and nwa in play as takeover candidates this year says that banks have been preparing to play a larger and larger role in acquisition financing 
 mr. <unk> says that in the past banks would normally have <unk> N N of a total buy-out price with the loans secured by the target company 's assets 
 another N N of the borrowed funds would come from the sale to investors of junk bonds which offer less security and typically carry higher yields than bank loans 
 mr. <unk> 's purchase of nwa mr. <unk> notes was probably the most aggressive to date with bank debt at N N of the purchase price 
 but mr. <unk> says that citicorp 's failure to deliver on its promise to raise the ual bank debt for a labor-management buy-out group is very <unk> to potential users of a <unk> letter from commercial banks 
 his client mr. davis used just such a letter from citicorp in pursuing ual citicorp later agreed to work with a competing ual buy-out group 
 executives of citicorp and chase manhattan declined to comment on either the ual situation or on the changing nature of banks ' role in financing takeovers 
 in the wake of campeau 's problems prices of junk bonds tumbled throwing into doubt the ability of corporate <unk> to finance large takeovers with the help of junk bond sales 
 mark <unk> senior managing director at manufacturers hanover trust co. says the <unk> in junk bonds may yet open new business opportunities to banks in <unk> takeovers 
 but he warns that banks will have to have enough discipline not to make loans that are too risky 
 in fact manufacturers hanover said in its third-quarter earnings report that fees from <unk> loans to other banks dropped N N to $ N million 
 we did n't take part in a lot of deals because their credit quality was poor says a bank spokesman 
 james b. lee head of <unk> and private <unk> at chemical banking corp. said he believes banks can still make a credible offer of <unk> shopping for takeover finance 
 as evidence he cites yesterday 's arrangement for the final financing of a $ N billion bid for american medical international inc. in which chemical served as both the lead bank and an equity investor 
 beyond the current weakness in the junk bond market banks have another advantage over investment banks in financing contested takeovers 
 arthur <unk> jr. a takeover lawyer at fried frank harris <unk> & jacobson notes that a political and emotional bias has developed against junk bonds 
 one hostile bidder who deliberately avoided using junk bonds was paramount communications inc. in its initial offer to acquire time inc. for $ N billion or $ N a share 
 a paramount spokesman says that decision was based on the financial not political <unk> of junk bonds 
 but some observers believe paramount chairman martin davis wanted to avoid the possible <unk> of being perceived as a corporate raider in his controversial bid for time 
 in the end mr. davis used junk bonds so that he could raise paramount 's bid to $ N a share 
 some <unk> <unk> said the initial lower bid without junk bonds was a factor in his losing the company 
 time <unk> paramount by acquiring warner communications inc 
 the success of the nwa financing and the failure of the ual deal also seem to highlight the important new role in takeover financing being played by japanese banks 
 japanese banks accounted for N N of the nwa bank debt according to a report by transportation secretary samuel skinner 
 but it was <unk> rejection by japanese banks that helped seal the fate of the attempt to buy ual 
 citicorp and chase are attempting to put together a new lower bid 
 <unk> <unk> chief economist of the institute for financial affairs inc. a tokyo research center on finance and economics says the junk bond market became very jittery and there 's a fear of a coming recession and the possible bankruptcy of lbo companies 
 <unk> inc. filed suit in federal court here alleging that a group that holds N N of its stock made false deceptive and misleading statements in recent regulatory filings and public announcements 
 <unk> 's complaint claims that the group led by investor malcolm i. glazer violated securities laws by failing to disclose plans to purchase N N of the company 's shares outstanding and that when the required hart-scott-rodino filing eventually was made it did n't disclose the group 's alleged earlier violation of the so-called <unk> requirements of the law 
 mr. glazer could n't immediately be reached to comment 
 but when <unk> last week publicly questioned the <unk> of the group 's filing procedures the rochester n.y. investor said we <unk> with every law and he denied any wrongdoing 
 the glazer group said in a securities and exchange commission filing in early october that it may seek a controlling interest in <unk> or seek representation on the company 's board 
 <unk> has said it does n't intend to be acquired by the glazer group or any other party 
 inland steel industries inc. battered by lower volume and higher costs posted a N N drop in third-quarter earnings 
 the nation 's <unk> steelmaker earned $ N million or N cents a share compared with $ N million or $ N a share a year earlier when the industry was enjoying peak demand and strong pricing 
 sales fell to $ N million from $ N billion 
 the earnings also mark a significant drop from the second quarter 's $ N million or $ N a share 
 moreover the earnings were well below analysts ' expectations of about $ N a share 
 in composite trading on the new york stock exchange inland closed yesterday at $ N a share down $ N 
 the company attributed the earnings drop to lower volume related to seasonal demand and the soft consumer durable market especially in the automotive sector 
 however the company also lost orders because of prolonged labor talks in the second quarter 
 third-quarter shipments slipped N N from the year-ago period and N N from this year 's second quarter 
 profit of steel shipped for the company 's steel segment slid to $ N a ton from $ N a ton a year earlier and $ N a ton a quarter earlier 
 analysts noted that the disappointing results do n't reflect lower prices for steel products 
 charles bradford an analyst with merrill lynch capital markets said higher prices for galvanized and <unk> products offset lower prices for bar <unk> and structural steel 
 structural steel which primarily serves the construction market was especially hurt by a N N price drop mr. bradford said 
 the company said its integrated steel sector was also hurt by higher raw material repair and maintenance and labor costs 
 the increased labor costs became effective aug. N under terms of the four-year labor agreement with the united steelworkers union 
 meanwhile the company 's service center segment which saw operating profit drop to $ N million from $ N million a year ago experienced much of the same demand and cost problems as well as start-up costs associated with a <unk> processing facility in chicago and an upgraded computer information system 
 inland chairman frank w. <unk> said the company 's short-term outlook is <unk> by uncertainties in the economy and financial markets 
 however he noted that steel mill bookings are up from early summer levels and that he expects the company to improve its cost performance in the fourth quarter 
 in the first nine months profit was $ N million or $ N a share on sales of $ N billion compared with $ N million or $ N a share on sales of $ N billion a year earlier 
 the seismic activity of a financial market bears a <unk> to the seismic activity of the earth 
 when things are quiet low volatility the structures on which markets stand can be relatively inefficient and still perform their functions adequately 
 however when powerful forces start shaking the market 's structure the more <unk> it is the better its chance for survival 
 america 's financial markets do not yet have all the required modern features required to make them fully <unk> 
 investors lack equal access to the markets ' trading arena and its information 
 that structural lack is crucial because investors are the only source of market liquidity 
 and liquidity is what markets need to damp <unk> and aftershocks 
 in today 's markets specialists on the new york stock exchange and <unk> market makers in the over-the-counter market are the only market participants allowed to play a direct role in the <unk> process 
 when they halt trading all market liquidity is gone 
 and when any component of the market cash futures or options loses liquidity the price discovery system the way prices are determined becomes flawed or is lost entirely for a time 
 last friday the 13th as well as two years ago this week the markets became <unk> 
 when that happened seismic tremors of fear much like the shock waves created by an earthquake <unk> through the market and increased the market 's volatility 
 lack of important needed information can cause fear 
 fear is the father of panic 
 panic frequently results in <unk> behavior 
 and in financial markets <unk> behavior is sometimes translated into catastrophe 
 when market tremors start it is crucial that as much information about transaction prices and the <unk> curve buy and sell orders at various prices be made available to all not just to market makers 
 because of a lack of information and access many investors including the very ones whose buying power could restore stability and damp volatility are forced to stand on the sidelines when they are most needed because of their ignorance of important market information 
 to add <unk> power to america 's markets a modern electronic trading system should be implemented that permits equal access to the trading arena and the information that would automatically <unk> such access by investors particularly institutional investors 
 contrary to some opinions the trading activities of specialists and other market makers do not provide liquidity to the market as a whole 
 what market makers provide is <unk> a very valuable service 
 liquidity is not a service 
 it is a market attribute the ability to absorb selling orders without causing significant price changes in the absence of news 
 market makers buy what investors wish to sell their business is <unk> these unwanted positions as quickly as possible to other investors and at a profit 
 as a result while any one customer may purchase <unk> by selling to a market maker which is <unk> for the investor the market as a whole remains in the same circumstances it was before the transaction the unwanted position is still an unwanted position only the identity of the seller has changed 
 in fact it can be argued that increasing capital commitments by market makers a result of some <unk> crash studies also increases market volatility since the more securities are held by market makers at any given time the more selling pressure is <unk> the market 
 in an open electronic system any investor <unk> to pay for <unk> access to the trading arena through a registered broker-dealer would be able to see the entire <unk> curve buy and sell orders at each price entered by dealers and investors alike and to enter and execute orders 
 current quotations would reflect the combined financial judgment of all market participants not just those of <unk> who become extremely <unk> during times of crisis 
 investors and professionals alike would compete on the level playing field congress sought and called a national market system not yet achieved almost N years ago when it passed the securities reform act of N 
 last friday 's market gyrations did not result in severe aftershocks 
 were we smart or just lucky 
 i 'm not certain 
 but i am sure we need to maximize our earthquake protection by making certain that our market structures let investors add their mighty <unk> power to our nation 's markets 
 mr. <unk> is chairman of his own consulting company in <unk> n.j 
 now you see it now you do n't 
 the recession that is 
 the economy 's <unk> steps leave investors wondering whether things are slowing down or speeding up 
 so often are government statistics revised that they seem to resemble a <unk> weather <unk> 
 for the past seven years investors have had the wind at their backs in the form of a generally growing economy 
 some may have forgotten and some younger ones may never have experienced what it 's like to invest during a recession 
 different tactics are called for as losing money becomes easier and making money becomes tougher 
 for those investors who believe or fear that N will be a recession year many economists and money managers agree on steps that can be taken to lower the risks in a portfolio 
 in a <unk> pros advise investors who expect a slowdown to hold fewer stocks than usual and to favor shares of big companies in defensive industries 
 a heavy <unk> of cash is prescribed along with a <unk> <unk> to bonds <unk> government bonds 
 it 's <unk> to think these defensive steps can be delayed until a recession is clearly at hand 
 but that may not be possible because recessions often take investors by surprise 
 they always seem to come a bit later than you expect 
 when they do hit they hit fast says david a. wyss chief financial economist at the data resources division of mcgraw-hill inc 
 though he himself does n't expect a recession soon mr. wyss advises people who do that the best thing to be in is long that is 20-year to 30-year treasury bonds 
 the reason is simple mr. wyss says interest rates almost always decline during recession 
 as surely as a <unk> <unk> falling interest rates force up the price of previously issued bonds 
 they are worth more because they pay higher interest than newly issued bonds do 
 that effect holds true for both short-term and long-term bonds 
 but short-term bonds ca n't rise too much because everyone knows they will be redeemed at a <unk> price fairly soon 
 long-term bonds with many years left before maturity swing more widely in price 
 but not just any bonds will do 
 corporate bonds are usually not a good bet in a recession mr. wyss says 
 as times get tougher investors <unk> about whether companies will have enough money to pay their debts 
 this <unk> the price of corporate bonds 
 also he notes most corporate bonds are callable 
 that means that a corporation after a specified amount of time has passed can buy back its bonds by paying investors the face value plus in some cases a <unk> 
 when interest rates have dropped it makes sense for corporations to do just that they then save on interest costs 
 but the investors are left <unk> with money to reinvest at a time when interest rates are <unk> 
 if corporate bonds are bad in recessions junk bonds are likely to be the worst of all 
 it 's an <unk> necessity to get out of junk bonds when a recession is in the <unk> says <unk> <unk> professor of finance at cornell university 
 such bonds are very sensitive to the downside and this could be a disaster 
 municipal bonds are generally a bit safer than corporate bonds in a recession but not as safe as bonds issued by the federal government 
 during an economic slump local tax revenues often go down raising the risks associated with at least some municipals 
 and like <unk> many municipal bonds are callable 
 but a few experts going against the consensus do n't think bonds would help investors even if a recession is in the <unk> 
 one of these is jeffrey l. beach director of research for <unk> <unk> & co. a brokerage house in houston who thinks that we 're either in a recession or about to go into one 
 what 's more he thinks this could be a <unk> recession than usual once the downturn comes it 's going to be very hard to reverse 
 investors he advises should be cautious holding fewer stocks than usual and also <unk> bonds 
 because he sees a N N to N N base rate of inflation in the economy he doubts that interest rates will fall much any time soon 
 instead mr. beach says investors probably should be carrying a very high level of cash by which he means such so-called cash equivalents as money-market funds and treasury bills 
 <unk> <unk> president of <unk> financial inc. in <unk> pa. also recommends that investors go heavily for cash 
 he is n't sure a recession is coming but says the other likely alternative <unk> inflation is just as bad 
 this late in an expansion the economy tends to <unk> off either into damaging inflation or into a recession mr. <unk> says 
 the federal reserve board 's plan for a soft landing he says requires the fed to <unk> an <unk> <unk> 
 a soft landing is n't something that can be achieved once and for all mr. <unk> adds 
 it has to be engineered over and over again month after month 
 he believes that the task facing fed chairman alan greenspan is so difficult that it resembles <unk> a <unk> <unk> and a <unk> saw 
 and in a sense that 's the kind of task individuals face in deciding what to do about stocks the mainstay of most serious investors ' portfolios 
 it comes down to a question of whether to try to time the market 
 for people who can ride out market waves through good times and bad stocks have been rewarding long-term investments 
 most studies show that <unk> investors historically have earned an annual return from stocks of N N to N N including both dividends and price appreciation 
 that 's well above what bonds or bank certificates have paid 
 moreover because no one knows for sure just when a recession is coming some analysts think investors should n't even worry too much about timing 
 trying to time the economy is a mistake says david katz chief investment officer of value <unk> management inc. in new york 
 mr. katz notes that some economists have been predicting a recession for at least two years 
 investors who <unk> and <unk> up on stocks have just hurt themselves he says 
 mr. katz adds that people who jump in and out of the stock market need to be right about N N of the time to beat a <unk> strategy 
 frequent trading runs up high commission costs 
 and the <unk> might miss the sudden <unk> that account for much of the stock market 's gains over time 
 still few investors are able to sit tight when they are convinced a recession is coming 
 after all in all five recessions since N stocks declined 
 according to <unk> davis president of <unk> davis research inc. in <unk> fla. the average drop in the dow jones industrial average was about N N and the decrease began an average of six months before a recession officially started 
 by the time a recession is official two consecutive quarters of declining gross national product much of the damage to stocks has already been done and in the typical case the recession is already half over 
 about six months before a recession ends stocks typically begin to rise again as investors anticipate a recovery 
 the average recession lasts about a year 
 unfortunately though recessions vary enough in length so that the average ca n't <unk> be used to guide investors in timing stock sales or purchases 
 but whatever their advice about timing none of these experts recommend <unk> stocks entirely during a recession 
 for the portion of an investor 's portfolio that stays in stocks professionals have a number of suggestions 
 mr. katz advocates issues with low price-earnings ratios that is low prices in <unk> to the company 's earnings per share 
 low <unk> stocks he says <unk> outperform others during a recession or bear market 
 in good times he says they lag a bit but overall they provide superior performance 
 prof. <unk> urges investors to <unk> stocks in small companies 
 <unk> shares typically fall more than <unk> stocks in a recession he says 
 and in any case he argues stocks of small companies are almost as <unk> as they were sept. N N just before the crash 
 for example mr. <unk> says stocks of small companies are selling for about N times cash flow 
 cash flow basically earnings plus depreciation is one common gauge of a company 's financial health 
 that ratio is <unk> close to the ratio of N that prevailed before the N stock-market crash mr. <unk> says 
 and it 's way above the ratio N times cash flow that bigger companies are selling for 
 another major <unk> in making a portfolio <unk> is choosing stocks in defensive industries 
 food tobacco drugs and utilities are the classic examples 
 recession or not people still eat smoke and take medicine when they 're sick 
 george <unk> iii editor of turnaround letter in boston offers one final tip for <unk> investors 
 keep some money available for opportunities he says

 mr. dorfman covers investing issues from the wall street journal 's new york bureau

 bond prices posted strong gains as investors went on a bargain hunt

 yesterday prudential-bache securities inc. said it postponed a $ N million senior subordinated debenture offering by york international corp 
 and donaldson lufkin & jenrette securities corp. scrambled to restructure and improve the potential returns on a $ N million debenture offering by chicago & north western acquisition corp. that was still being negotiated late last night 
 the issue by chicago & north western is one of the so-called good junk-bond offerings on the new-issue calendar 
 some analysts said the restructuring of the railroad concern 's issue shows how tough it is for underwriters to sell even the junk bonds of a company considered to be a relatively good credit risk 
 since last week 's junk-bond market debacle many new issues of high-yield high-risk corporate bonds have either been scaled back delayed or dropped 
 on wednesday drexel burnham lambert inc. had to slash the size of continental airlines ' junk-bond offering to $ N million from $ N million 
 salomon brothers inc. has delayed grand union co. 's $ N billion junk-bond offering while it <unk> the transaction 
 last week the grand union offering was sweetened to include warrants that allow bondholders to acquire common stock 
 prudential-bache said the york issue was delayed because of market conditions 
 everything is going through <unk> right now and chicago & north western is no exception said <unk> <unk> vice president high-yield research at citicorp 
 portfolio managers say <unk> like equity <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> may increasingly be required to sell junk-bond deals 
 dan baldwin managing director of high-yield investments at chancellor capital management said the chicago & north western offering was restructured in part because several large insurance buyers right now are demanding equity as part of the package 
 if you 're going to take the risk in this market you want something extra 
 mr. baldwin likes the offering 
 but several mutual-fund managers nervous about the deteriorating quality of their junk-bond portfolios and shy about buying new issues said they 're staying away from any junk security that is n't considered first rate for its class 
 while they consider the chicago & north western issue to be good they do n't view it as the best 
 to lure buyers to the chicago & north western bonds portfolio managers said donaldson lufkin sweetened the transaction by offering the bonds with a <unk> interest rate and a N N equity <unk> 
 the bonds are expected to have a N N N coupon rate 
 the equity arrangement apparently would allow bondholders to buy a total of N N of the stock of cnw corp. chicago & north western 's parent company 
 donaldson lufkin declined to comment on the restructuring 
 according to some analysts familiar with the negotiations the N N of equity would come directly from donaldson lufkin and a fund affiliated with the investment bank blackstone group which would reduce their cnw equity holdings by N N each 
 that would leave the blackstone fund with a N N stake and donaldson lufkin with N N 
 despite the problems with new issues high-yield bonds showed gains in the secondary or <unk> market 
 junk bonds ended about one-half point higher with so-called high-quality issues from rjr capital holdings corp. and <unk> gas service limited partnership rising one point

 short-term treasury securities ended narrowly mixed with two-year notes posting slight declines while three-year notes were slightly higher 
 yesterday the fed executed four-day matched sales a technical trading operation designed to drain reserves from the banking system 
 the move was interpreted by some economists as a sign that the fed does n't want the federal funds rate to move any lower than the N N N at which it has been <unk> around during the past week 
 the closely watched funds rate is what banks charge each other on overnight loans 
 it is considered an early signal of fed credit policy changes 
 the fact that they did four-day matched sales means they are not in a mood to ease aggressively 
 they are telling us that N N N is as low as they want to see the fed funds rate said robert <unk> at <unk> bank plc

 the average yield on the bills was N N down from N N at the previous 52-week bill auction sept. N 
 yesterday 's yield was the lowest since N N on july N

 junk bond price climbed yesterday despite <unk> in the new-issue market for high-yield securities

 activity was brisk in the high-grade general obligation market as a series of sell lists hit the street and capped upward price movement in the sector 
 traders estimated that more than $ N million of high-grade bonds was put up for sale via <unk> lists circulated by a handful of major brokers 
 there was speculation that the supply was coming from a commercial bank 's portfolios 
 according to market participants the bonds were met with decent bids but the volume of paper left high grades in the 10-year and under maturity range unchanged to N percentage point higher in yield

 premium government national mortgage association securities with coupon rates of N N and higher actually declined amid concerns about increased prepayments because of a plan being considered by congress to speed the refinancing of <unk> mortgages 
 ginnie mae N N securities were down about N at N N 
 if the refinancing plan clears congress there could be fairly heavy prepayments on the premium securities hurting any investor paying much above par for them 
 in the <unk> sector a shift in the treasury yield curve resulting from the better performance of <unk> issues over <unk> securities hurt major coupons because it will become more difficult to structure new derivative securities offerings 
 ginnie mae N N securities ended at N N up N and federal home loan mortgage corp. N N securities were at N N up N 
 the ginnie mae N N issue was yielding N N to a 12-year average life assumption as the spread above the treasury 10-year note widened N percentage point to N

 the <unk> approaches makes his pitch 
 it may be <unk> he wants money for food or <unk> <unk> his sister is at this very moment near death in <unk> he has lost his <unk> and has only $ N in change to put toward a bus ticket costing $ N and wo n't you give him the difference 
 no 
 well how about a loan he 'll take your name and address 
 figuring that their money would more likely go toward a bottle of night train express most people have little trouble saying no to <unk> like this 
 but healthy skepticism <unk> when they are <unk> by an organized charity to help fight cancer <unk> child abuse or what have you 
 most see little reason to doubt that their cash will go toward these noble goals 
 but will it 
 in a <unk> number of cases no 
 in fact the <unk> sometimes might be better off giving the money to the <unk> at least he has no overhead and he might even be telling the truth 
 last year more than $ N billion was donated to the nation 's N charities 
 while the vast bulk of it was indeed spent by reputable organizations on the good works it was raised for it 's equally true that a sizable <unk> was consumed in expenses claimed by other operators including fraudulent expenses 
 in many cases the costs claimed were so high that only a <unk> of cash was left for the <unk> beneficiaries 
 it 's impossible to say exactly how much of the total charity <unk> is <unk> by <unk> fund-raising costs <unk> operators and downright fraud 
 but the problem clearly is widespread and persistent 
 state law enforcers can barely keep up with charity scams and reports from <unk> groups such as the council of better business bureaus are not encouraging 
 the <unk> advisory service of the <unk> reviews hundreds of new charities every year measuring them against minimum standards for accountability for <unk> and honesty in solicitation and for percentage of funds actually going to work for which the charity was supposedly established 
 the service figures at least half of the money taken in should be spent on program 
 roughly a third of the charities reviewed <unk> the test 
 which it should be added does n't prevent the charities from <unk> in a lot of money anyway 
 without a <unk> and a subpoena it 's often hard to sort out <unk> causes from <unk> if all you 've got to go on is the solicitation itself 
 on this basis there 's no way the average person can know a good charity from a bad one says david <unk> an assistant attorney general in connecticut 
 a lot of <unk> just get taken 
 including those he contends who put about $ N million into the <unk> for the connecticut association of concerned veterans and the vietnam veterans service center 
 the state has sued these charities in state court complaining that much of the money was grossly <unk> N N says mr. <unk> went to fund <unk> and most of the rest to the people who ran the charities and to their <unk> for fur coats trips to florida <unk> restaurant <unk> 
 the telephone number for the charity in <unk> conn. has been <unk> and the former officials could n't be located 
 running a charity does cost money but reputable organizations manage to get the lion 's share of donations out to where they are really needed 
 the <unk> foundation the american cancer society and the united way of america all say that they spend roughly N N of their income on programs not overhead 
 with some other charities however it s the other way around 
 the fledgling national children 's cancer society for example took in $ N million last year to finance <unk> transplants for children 
 by the time it paid its expenses it only had $ N left not enough to treat even one child 
 the state of illinois is suing the charity for fraud in chicago along with <unk> marketing inc. its <unk> fund <unk> 
 both deny wrongdoing 
 the charity admits spending a lot on fund raising but says that was necessary to establish a <unk> base it can tap at much lower cost in years to come 
 michael burns president of <unk> says his concern has only benefited from the publicity surrounding the case noting that three other charities have signed on as clients because they were impressed with the amount he raised for national children 's 
 meanwhile a state court judge has allowed the charity to go on soliciting funds 
 enforcers ca n't put charities out of business simply because they spend the lion 's share of their income on fund raising 
 state laws previously used as a <unk> minimum <unk> of income usually half that had to be spent on the program rather than overhead but these have been <unk> by the u.s. supreme court 
 it has ruled that such laws might work to <unk> fund raising which would amount to limiting the charities ' <unk> right to freedom of expression 
 this puts upon enforcers the burden of proving outright fraud or <unk> and such actions have been brought against hundreds of charities recently 
 the attorney general 's office in connecticut alone has put seven of them out of business over the past couple of years and the enforcement drive is continuing there and elsewhere 
 in making cases the authorities frequently zero in on alleged <unk> made by the charities ' fund <unk> 
 illinois for instance currently has under investigation N of the N companies <unk> up funds for charities soliciting there 
 enforcers pay special attention to operators using <unk> prizes as an additional <unk> to give 
 attorneys general in several states including illinois are already suing watson & <unk> co. an <unk> <unk> outfit that they say has used deceptive <unk> ads to <unk> donations for the american heart disease foundation and the cancer fund of america 
 according to the illinois attorney general 's suit watson & <unk> sent <unk> indicating that recipients were guaranteed cash prizes and could win up to an additional $ N on top of them if they contributed as little as $ N 
 but the total value of the prizes was only $ N and most winners will receive just N cents according to the attorney general 's office 
 the suit is still pending in illinois state court 
 watson & <unk> has denied the allegations in court officials decline to comment further 
 while they can target some of the most obvious <unk> enforcers concede that they are only <unk> the surface 
 there are so many <unk> <unk> used by so many dubious operators they say that it is probably impossible to stop them all 
 one maneuver the public education <unk> 
 the solicitation material indicates that donations will go toward a campaign <unk> and <unk> the public about some health or other issue 
 what it does n't say is that the entire campaign may be the fund-raising letter itself 
 all too often this will merely be a statement on the solicitation such as do n't smoke or wear <unk> <unk> says william webster attorney general of missouri 
 by putting these <unk> statements on the <unk> hundreds of thousands of dollars are claimed to have been spent on education to consumers when in fact this represents the costs of sending the newsletters 
 mr. webster cites a <unk> mailing from the united cancer council that offers a chance to win $ N in gold bullion to those giving as little as $ N to cancer education 
 a few <unk> warnings about cancer appear but that 's only two inches in all four pages 
 i think some people may believe they 're helping fund a massive tv and print campaign but we could n't find that the charity does anything except write these letters he says 
 officials at the washington <unk> charity did n't return repeated phone calls 
 many <unk> charities ride the <unk> of the biggest best-known and most reputable ones by adopting names similar to theirs 
 the established charities are bothered by this but say they can do little about it 
 we ca n't police the many organizations that have <unk> up in the last few years using part of our name 
 most of them do n't last for long but in the meantime all we can do is tell people they are n't connected with us says a spokeswoman for the american heart association 
 and sometimes a reputable charity with a household name gets used and does n't even know it 
 a couple in <unk> ill. raised $ N earlier this year using the name and <unk> of mothers against drunk driving without permission from the group 
 <unk> did n't learn of the fund raising until the couple sent it a check for $ N along with a letter saying that was the charity 's share 
 the illinois attorney general won a court order to prevent the couple from raising further funds without <unk> 's permission 
 the couple could n't be reached for comment and apparently have left <unk> law enforcement officials report

 british airways plc a crucial participant in the proposed buy-out of ual corp. <unk> its hands of the current efforts to revive a bid for the parent of united airlines 
 specifically the british carrier said it currently has no plans to participate in any new offer for ual 
 in addition british air officially withdrew its support for the previous $ 300-a-share bid in a <unk> statement that said the original deal is closed 
 company officials said later that british airways believes its involvement in the ual buy-out ended last friday when the buy-out group which also includes ual 's management and pilot union failed to obtain financing for the $ N billion transaction 
 the carrier stopped short of saying it would n't at some point reconsider participating in any new bid for ual 
 however company officials said they plan to take no initiatives to <unk> the transaction and are n't aware of any restructured bid in the making 
 <unk> the statements raised questions about whether a new bid for ual will ever get off the ground 
 the transaction has had a series of setbacks since the financing problems became known last friday with no signs or statements from the buy-out group to indicate that any progress has taken place 
 however in response to the british air decision united 's pilot union vowed to continue efforts to revive the buy-out 
 pilot union chairman frederick c. <unk> said advisers to ual management and the union will begin meeting in new york today and will work through the weekend to devise a new proposal to present to ual 's board at the earliest time possible 
 pilot union advisers appeared confident that a new bid could go forward even without british air 's participation 
 ual declined to comment on british air 's statement 
 ual chairman stephen m. wolf who is leading the management end of the buy-out has n't provided investors with any assurances about the prospect of a new deal 
 in another setback yesterday united 's <unk> union asked the treasury department to investigate whether certain aspects of the original buy-out proposal violated tax laws 
 in an effort to <unk> the buy-out the union has already called for investigations by the securities and exchange commission transportation department and labor department 
 but there was one bright spot yesterday 
 the united <unk> union agreed to negotiations that could lead to the flight attendants contributing concessions to a revived bid in exchange for an ownership stake 
 the pilot union the only one to support the buy-out thus far said the flight attendants ' decision <unk> our belief that an <unk> owned airline is practical and <unk> 
 still without the assurance of british airways ' financial backing it will be tougher for the buy-out group to convince <unk> banks to make loan commitments for a revised bid especially since british air 's original investment represented N N of the cash equity contribution for the bid 
 under the previous plan british air would have received a N N stake in ual in exchange for a $ N million equity investment with a N N stake going to ual employees and N N to ual management 
 british air officials said the airline 's chairman lord king was concerned about news reports indicating that british air might be willing to participate in a bid that included a lower purchase price and better investment terms for the british carrier 
 the previous reports were based on remarks by british air 's chief financial officer <unk> stevens who said any revised bid would have to include a lower purchase price to reflect the sharp drop in ual 's stock in the past week 
 ual stock dropped $ N yesterday to $ N on volume of N shares in composite trading on the new york stock exchange 
 ual declined to comment on british air 's statement 
 in an interview wednesday with dow jones professional investor report mr. stevens said we 're in no way committed to a deal going through at all 
 we 're not rushing into anything 
 we do n't want to be party to a second rejection 
 indeed british air seemed to be <unk> itself from the troubled transaction early in an effort to avoid any further embarrassment 
 the original transaction fell through on the same day british air shareholders approved the plan at a special meeting after the british succeeded in arranging the financing for its equity contribution 
 the carrier also seemed eager to place blame on its american counterparts 
 the buy-out consortium <unk> to exist because our american partners were not capable of organizing the financing a british air spokesman said 
 british airways may have begun to have second thoughts about the transaction after the transportation department forced northwest 's airlines ' new owners to restructure the equity contribution of <unk> royal dutch airlines in that carrier 
 most of the department 's statements since the northwest transaction indicated it planned to curtail foreign ownership stakes in u.s. carriers 
 even before british air 's announcement pilot union leaders had been meeting in chicago yesterday to consider their options 
 the leaders expressed support for trying to revive the bid following a briefing wednesday by the union 's advisers lazard <unk> & co. and paul weiss <unk> <unk> & garrison 
 they also unanimously <unk> mr. <unk> the union chairman who has led the pilots ' N 1\/2-year fight to take control of the airline 
 ual 's advisers have indicated previously that it may take a while to come forward with a revised plan since they want to have firm bank commitments before launching a new bid 
 they have maintained that banks remain interested in financing the transaction 
 the buy-out fell through after citicorp and chase manhattan corp. the lead banks in the transaction failed to obtain $ N billion in financing needed for the plan

 senate democrats <unk> a cut in the capital-gains tax have decided under pressure from their leaders not to offer their own proposal placing another obstacle in the path of president bush 's legislative priority 
 a core group of six or so democratic senators has been working behind the scenes to develop a proposal to reduce the tax on the gain from the sale of assets 
 the plan was complete except for finishing <unk> and there was talk that it would be unveiled as early as yesterday 
 but senate majority leader george mitchell d. maine a vigorous opponent of the capital-gains tax cut called the group to meet with him wednesday night and again yesterday 
 sen. mitchell urged them to <unk> 
 afterward leaders of the dissident democrats <unk> and said they would n't offer their own proposal as they had planned 
 the decision is a setback for president bush who needs the support of democrats to pass the tax cut through the <unk> senate 
 having a proposal sponsored by democrats would have given the president an advantage 
 having only a republican measure makes the task harder 
 still sen. bob packwood r. ore. the lead sponsor of the republican capital-gains amendment predicted that the tax cut would be enacted this year 
 he said a clear majority of senators back the tax reduction and that ultimately there would be enough senators to overcome any procedural hurdle the democratic leadership might <unk> 
 but sen. mitchell buoyed by his victory among fellow democrats strongly disagreed 
 mr. mitchell has been predicting that the president 's initiative would fail this year 
 yesterday in an interview he added that the democrats ' decision increases the likelihood that a capital-gains tax cut will not pass this year 
 mr. mitchell 's first victory came last week when the senate passed a deficit-reduction bill that did n't contain a capital-gains provision 
 that vote made it unlikely that a capital-gains tax cut would be included in the final bill now being drafted by house and senate negotiators 
 the house version of the bill does include the tax cut 
 now republican leaders are concentrating on <unk> a capital-gains amendment to some other bill perhaps a measure raising the federal borrowing limit or a second tax bill that would follow on the heels of the deficit-reduction legislation 
 to help lay the <unk> for that fight president bush plans early next week to meet at the white house with some N democratic senators who favor cutting the capital-gains tax or are <unk> on the issue 
 the president apparently will have only one bill to push sen. packwood 's and at least some of the dissident democrats plan to support it 
 i may want to offer additional amendments to improve it when the bill comes to the floor said sen. david boren d. okla. a leader of those democrats 
 the packwood plan as expected would allow individuals to exclude from income N N of the gain from the sale of a capital asset held for more than one year 
 the exclusion would rise five percentage points for each year the asset was held until it reached a maximum of N N after seven years 
 the exclusion would apply to assets sold after oct. N 
 as an alternative taxpayers could chose to reduce their gains by an inflation index 
 for corporations the top tax rate on the sale of assets held for more than three years would be cut to N N from the current top rate of N N 
 that rate would gradually decline to as little as N N for corporate assets held for N years 
 the packwood plan also would include a proposal designed by sen. william roth r. del. that would create new tax benefits for individual retirement accounts 
 the roth plan would create a new <unk> ira from which money could be withdrawn tax-free not only for retirement but also for the purchase of a first home education expenses and medical expenses 
 current iras could be rolled over into the new iras but would be subject to tax though no penalty 
 westmoreland coal co. <unk> benefits of a sustained effort to cut costs and boost productivity reported sharply improved third-quarter results 
 the producer and marketer of <unk> coal said net income for the quarter was $ N million or N cents a share on revenue of $ N million 
 for the year-earlier period the company reported a loss of $ N or six cents a share 
 in the latest nine months the company earned $ N million or $ N a share 
 last year 's net loss of $ N included a benefit of $ N from an accounting change 
 revenue for the nine months rose to $ N million from $ N million 
 in an interview <unk> hutchinson president and chief executive cited several reasons for the improvement higher employee productivity and good natural conditions in the mines as well as lower costs for materials administrative overhead and debt interest 
 in the latest nine months mr. hutchinson said total coal sales rose to about N million tons from about N million tons a year earlier 
 in addition long-term debt has been trimmed to about $ N million from $ N million since jan. N 
 he predicted the debt ratio will improve further in coming quarters 
 westmoreland 's strategy is to retain and expand its core business of mining and selling <unk> coal in the <unk> region 
 the operating territory includes coal terminals on the ohio river and in newport news va 
 westmoreland exports about a fourth of its coal <unk> including a significant amount of <unk> coal produced by others that is used by steelmakers overseas 
 for the past couple of years westmoreland has undertaken an aggressive streamlining of all aspects of its business 
 marginal operations and assets have been sold 
 the size of the company 's board has been reduced to eight directors from N 
 about N <unk> management jobs and hundreds of hourly wage positions have been eliminated 
 even <unk> have been reduced 
 for example the chief executive himself now pays N N of the cost of his health benefits the company used to pay N N 
 i think the ship is now <unk> the <unk> are pumped and we are on course mr. hutchinson said of the restructuring program 
 much of what we set out to do is completed 
 but he cautioned that westmoreland 's third quarter is typically better than the fourth so investors should n't just <unk> the third quarter by four and assume the same rate of improvement can be sustained 
 one difference he said is that the fourth quarter has significantly fewer <unk> because of holidays and the hunting season 
 i do n't want to give the impression that everybody can relax now he said 
 we have to keep working at improving our core business to stay efficient 
 it 's a process that never really ends 
 nevertheless mr. hutchinson predicted that N would be <unk> profitable for westmoreland and that N would bring more of the same 
 for all of N the company reported an after-tax operating loss of $ N on revenue of $ N million 
 an accounting adjustment made net income $ N million or N cents a share 
 in a move that <unk> the company 's basic strategy its westmoreland energy inc. unit is developing four <unk> <unk> plants with a partner in virginia 
 some of the coal the plants buy will come from westmoreland mines 
 mr. hutchinson predicted that the unit 's contribution to company results in the 1990s will be exciting 
 he said westmoreland is looking at investment stakes in other <unk> plants east of the mississippi river 
 westmoreland expects energy demand to grow annually in the N N range in the early 1990s 
 we see coal 's piece of the action growing mr. hutchinson said 
 coal prices while not <unk> will grow modestly in real terms we think 
 chase manhattan corp. after trying unsuccessfully to sell its interest in its lower manhattan operations building has exercised its option to purchase the <unk> office tower 
 chase had purchased an option to buy the building at one new york plaza for an undisclosed sum from the late <unk> atlas as part of its original lease in N 
 the current transaction cost the bank approximately $ N million 
 of that amount $ N million was payment for the land <unk> the building and the rest was for the building itself 
 the building houses about N chase workers most of whom will be moved to downtown brooklyn after the bank 's new back office center is completed in N 
 the move is part of chase 's strategy to consolidate its back offices under one <unk> 
 the headquarters is located a few blocks away at N chase manhattan plaza 
 as part of its decision to leave the building chase tried to sell its interest along with the atlas estate 's interest shortly after the october N stock market crash 
 chase senior vice president george <unk> said the bank decided to exercise its option after bids fell short of expectations 
 he said chase and the atlas estate were looking to sell the entire building for $ N million to $ N million but did n't get an offer for more than $ N million

 new york real estate brokerage edward s. gordon co. will have the difficult task of finding new tenants 
 even with its striking views of the new york harbor the building is considered <unk> by modern office standards

 wall street shake hands with george <unk> 
 the author of the <unk> novel N invented a language called <unk> that made it impossible to fully develop a <unk> thought that is anything negative about the policies and practices of the state 
 wall street has n't gotten that far yet but it has made a promising start 
 its language call it <unk> is increasingly <unk> reassuring and designed to make financial products and <unk> appear better safer or cheaper than they really are 
 when something <unk> nasty happens a few <unk> are deployed to simply make it disappear much as a fresh grave may be covered by a blanket of flowers

 either way the word broker is clearly out of favor 
 of the major new york-based securities firms only morgan stanley & co. still calls its salespeople brokers

 what could be better than getting a <unk> more income from them the plus than other people 
 indeed conservative investors many of them elderly have poured more than $ N billion into such funds which promise <unk> yields than ordinary treasury bonds only to learn later that these funds use part of their money to <unk> in high-risk bond options a <unk> 's game 
 when a certain class of investment <unk> so poorly that its reputation is <unk> look for wall street to give it a new <unk> 
 this seems to be happening now to limited partnerships many of which either have gone into the tank in recent years or have otherwise been <unk> disappointments 
 they are still being sold but more and more often as direct investments with all the same risks they had under the old label 
 in such cases the game has n't changed only the name 
 in others a familiar old name still <unk> but the underlying game has changed 
 for example no load mutual funds remain a favorite with investors because they do n't carry a <unk> sales commission 
 getting out of them however may be a different story now 
 traditional <unk> made their money by charging an annual management fee usually a modest one they imposed no other fees and many still do n't 
 in recent years though a <unk> of others flying the <unk> flag have been imposing hefty charges all the way up to N N when an investor sells his shares 
 should n't they properly be called <unk> funds 
 the mutual-fund industry is <unk> the question but do n't expect a new name while the old one is working so well

 american telephone & telegraph co. for one is still a favorite of <unk> <unk> and trust departments but <unk> of its regional telephone units and exposed to competition on every side it is a far different investment prospect than it was before divestiture

 larry <unk> a money manager in san mateo calif. blames that on the advent of program trading in which computers used by big institutional investors are <unk> to buy and sell big blocks when certain market conditions prevail 
 blue chips he says are now being referred to as <unk> chips 
 finally even the <unk> strategy called value investing no longer means what it once did 
 before the takeover mania of the '80s it referred to <unk> out through analysis undervalued stocks especially those with <unk> management sound fundamentals and decent prospects 
 now says mr. <unk> value investing often means looking for <unk> companies with terrible management that are in real trouble 
 to institutional investors or brokers he adds a company with value is a company at risk of being <unk> up 
 ms. <unk> covers personal finance from the wall street journal 's los angeles bureau 
 i was <unk> to read your recent news stories on the banking industry 's reserve additions and <unk> threats to cease making new loans to less-developed countries 
 if the whole story were told it would read something like this 
 during the 1970s the commercial banks <unk> the country loan business away from the bond markets where the discipline of a prospectus and use of proceeds confirmation allowed lenders to audit expenditures of old loans before new loans were made 
 the reward for that reckless lending was high reported earnings and management bonuses the price a sea of bad loans 
 for the past several years the banks lacking a private navy to enforce their interests have been <unk> the u.s. treasury to underwrite their bad <unk> credits 
 the treasury <unk> has refused but has concluded that indirect credit support through various multinational agencies should be made available for a price either debt reduction or <unk> reduction or new loans the brady plan 
 the banks will threaten not to make further loans but in truth lacking the capital to write off their mistakes or to build a navy they have no alternative but to go along

 gillette co. elected warren e. buffett chairman of <unk> <unk> inc. to its board increasing the number of directors to N from N 
 <unk> <unk> earlier this year bought $ N million of preferred stock in gillette that is convertible into an N N stake and gillette said at the time that mr. buffett would be added to the board 
 separately gillette said its third-quarter earnings rose N N to $ N million or N cents a share from $ N million or N cents a share in the year-earlier period per-share earnings remained flat despite an increase in net income in part because the company paid a $ N million dividend on the new preferred stock in the period 
 sales rose N N to $ N million from $ N million with sales of the company 's <unk> operations well above the year <unk> 
 for the nine months gillette 's net income declined N N to $ N million or $ N a share from $ N million or $ N a share in the N period 
 sales rose N N to $ N billion from $ N billion 
 in composite trading on the new york stock exchange the company closed yesterday at $ N a share up N cents 
 when walter yetnikoff the president of sony corp. 's cbs records last month told producer peter guber that sony was about to make a $ N billion bid for columbia pictures and needed someone to run the studio mr. guber jumped at the chance 
 within two days he was on his way to new york and tokyo to meet with top <unk> at sony 
 and before the week was out sony had offered mr. guber and his partner jon peters the most lucrative employment contracts in the history of the movie business 
 not only that sony also agreed to give them a stake in columbia 's future profits and buy their company guber peters entertainment co. for $ N million almost N N more than the market value of the company 
 there was just one sticking point the two had a prior commitment 
 just seven months earlier they had signed a five-year exclusive contract to make movies for warner bros. for which they had just produced the <unk> hit batman 
 but mr. guber figured that warner communications inc. chairman steven ross would <unk> and let the producers go knowing the sony offer was the culmination of a life 's work 
 he figured wrong 
 last week following <unk> settlement talks warner now <unk> with time inc. filed a $ N billion breach of contract suit in los angeles superior court against both sony and guber peters 
 sony promptly <unk> charging warner with trying to sabotage its acquisitions and hurt its efforts to enter the u.s. movie business 
 the accusations of lying and <unk> are flying thick and fast on both sides as one sony executive puts it it 's world war iii 
 that two successful producers who are n't all that well known outside hollywood could occasion such a clash of corporate <unk> suggests how desperate the <unk> for proven talent is in the movie business 
 and they are a very odd team in any case 
 mr. guber was raised in boston and educated in new york 
 he is a lawyer with a string of academic degrees 
 mr. peters is a high-school <unk> who came to fame as <unk> <unk> 's <unk> 
 yet they are far and away the most <unk> producers in hollywood 
 and despite their share of <unk> they make movies that make money 
 that is a <unk> sony badly needs and warner is loath to lose 
 although columbia had a good summer with <unk> ii and when harry met <unk> rivals such as warner paramount pictures walt disney co. and universal studios have been <unk> columbia at the box office 
 after five years of management turmoil with four different studio heads columbia <unk> needs a stable <unk> team to restore its credibility and get it back in the business of making hits 
 mr. guber and mr. peters are n't <unk> loved in hollywood but they are well connected 
 their stock in trade as executive producers is <unk> out hot properties <unk> them up and then getting big studios to <unk> and distribute them 
 sometimes mr. guber and mr. peters do little more than grab the first draft of a <unk> for a <unk> or buy rights to a best seller such as the color <unk> 
 it falls to others to do the writing <unk> and producing 
 with mgm\/ua 's <unk> for instance messrs. guber and peters had virtually nothing to do with day-to-day production but their names still appear in big letters on the credits and they are inevitably associated with its success 
 sometimes as with batman the pair really do make the film 
 in that case guber peters acquired the rights in N <unk> the movie through a dozen scripts and were on the set in london for N months <unk> over the most minute changes in casting and production 
 they 're the best production talent around says brian de <unk> <unk> to guber peters for hiring him to direct the warner movie of tom <unk> 's novel <unk> of the <unk> 
 on that film which is to start shooting in a few months they 've been very much involved hiring talent and discussing the development of the script 
 and when you 're making a movie this big you need all the help you can get mr. de <unk> adds 
 i wish they were around N hours a day 
 and some movies seem to have been hurt by their <unk> 
 warner executives blame mr. guber 's and mr. peters 's lack of involvement in <unk> ii for casting and production problems and the film 's ultimate dismal failure 
 we 've had a few <unk> admits mr. peters 
 but by and large this company has only been profitable 
 he says his company 's <unk> at packaging and marketing is why we 'll be good at columbia 
 we practically ran our own studio 
 longtime hollywood associates describe mr. guber as the intellectual powerhouse of the two a man with a <unk> for <unk> and marketing 
 peter is a major piece of hollywood manpower who has really earned his success says robert <unk> an agent at creative artists agency 
 mark johnson the producer of <unk> <unk> in he has a great ability to hire <unk> people and delegate authority 
 it 's no accident that they 've been able to develop such successful material 
 mr. peters on the other hand has fewer fans in hollywood and his <unk> like to <unk> him as something of a <unk> <unk> 
 he gets better reviews as a creative <unk> an <unk> an idea man 
 he also had to fight harder for credibility than his partner did 
 <unk> <unk> made him famous 
 he cut her hair 
 he lived with her 
 he came to produce her records and her movies a star is born and the main event 
 <unk> married but now single mr. peters got plenty of ink last summer for an <unk> <unk> with actress kim <unk> during the making of batman 
 mr. guber by contrast has been married to one woman for more than N years 
 but for all their intellectual and <unk> differences they make the perfect good <unk> bad <unk> team hollywood associates say 
 peter is the bright sympathetic guy when you 're doing a deal says one agent 
 if there 's a problem peter disappears and all of a sudden jon shows up 
 mr. guber and mr. peters <unk> many people in hollywood the wrong way 
 producers don simpson and jerry <unk> who <unk> <unk> through several scripts and ultimately produced the movie <unk> when messrs. guber and peters take credit for the film 
 says mr. simpson the script was <unk> 
 we <unk> it 
 we are the producers of that movie 
 they got a small piece of the net profits and a screen credit as executive producers 
 when roger <unk> an executive who worked for guber peters in the early 1980s left to take a job as head of production at the united artists studio they made him <unk> all credits and financial interest in the films he had helped develop including <unk> and batman 
 mr. peters acknowledges that and says it 's not unlike the situation he and mr. guber are in with warner 
 i was upset with roger i <unk> and <unk> says mr. peters 
 but he wanted to pursue his own dream and he went 
 still mr. <unk> says his relationship with guber peters was one of the most successful i 've had in hollywood 
 the two have a wonderful chemistry jon is very <unk> and peter is very <unk> adds mr. <unk> who is now head of production at news corp. 's 20th century fox film co 
 jon peters will come <unk> into a room say he 's got a great idea and be gone 
 peter will take the <unk> of that idea and make it grow into something specific 
 mr. <unk> recalls that mr. guber and mr. peters shifted into high gear a few years back upon learning that they had competition for the story of the murdered <unk> <unk> <unk> which became <unk> in the <unk> 
 he says within a few weeks we made deals with the government of <unk> and everyone who had ever met or talked to <unk> <unk> 
 i think peter even made some deals with the <unk> 
 universal studios was working on a competing film but the studio and its producers ultimately agreed to <unk> the film with guber peters and warner 
 more recently guber peters beat out a dozen other producers reportedly including robert redford and ted turner for rights to the life story of <unk> <unk> the murdered brazilian union leader who fought developers in the <unk> rain forest 
 messrs. guber and peters <unk> <unk> the man 's widow for months showing her a tape of <unk> in the <unk> to <unk> her with the quality of their work 
 money helped too 
 ultimately they paid more than $ N million for the rights 
 the sale caused a <unk> between the widow and some of her husband 's <unk> 
 some of the money will go to the <unk> <unk> foundation but it is n't earmarked for groups trying to save the rain forest 
 it 's hardly <unk> given the men 's track record that sony wants mr. guber and mr. peters 
 but it is <unk> to some hollywood executives that sony rushed to hire them without clearing up the warner situation first 
 some note that sony might have saved itself some trouble by just hiring mr. guber and letting mr. peters stay on to fulfill the warner contract 
 but though people in town may ask why guber needs peters it 's good to have a partner and obviously the chemistry works says steven tisch a producer who once worked for mr. guber 
 this business is n't about <unk> at the end of the day it s about whether the ink is red or black 
 in the case of peter and jon the ink has been very very black 
 mr. guber got his start in the movie business at columbia two decades ago 
 recruited from new york university 's <unk> program he rose within two years to head of production overseeing such films as the way we were taxi driver <unk> and <unk> 
 in N he <unk> up with record producer neil bogart in <unk> records and <unk> later called <unk> pictures where they produced such hits as as the deep and midnight express 
 in N mr. guber got together with mr. peters by then a successful producer in his own right after the death of mr. bogart 
 while guber peters produced a number of hits for warner and others their record was n't always so impressive 
 among their <unk> were the <unk> of <unk> jean <unk> clue and <unk> of the <unk> bear 
 and the failures make it possible for warner in its current lawsuit to <unk> the producers as <unk> 
 the studio says it stuck with them even in the early years when the creative partnership was not particularly profitable for warner 
 mr. guber replies that this is a <unk> this time warner trying to <unk> up two <unk> who have done only well for them for a long period of time 
 mr. guber and mr. peters maintain that executives at warner have always known of their ambitions to run a major entertainment powerhouse but that warner never felt threatened until they linked up with sony 
 from the beginning they knew we had a goal and a dream says mr. guber 
 on a number of occasions he adds he tried to get warner to buy guber peters outright 
 they always <unk> but they never acted mr. guber says 
 in N mr. guber and mr. peters contributed their company 's assets in exchange for a N N stake in <unk> entertainment a <unk> tv production company controlled by giant industries inc. chairman burt sugarman 
 in july a year later warner agreed to release the producers from their old contract when messrs. guber peters and sugarman made a $ N million offer to buy N N of mgm\/ua 
 mr. guber and mr. peters planned to run the nearly <unk> mgm studio and the two even tried to interest warner <unk> president terry semel in becoming a partner after he advised them on the deal 
 but the mgm plan collapsed just two weeks later 
 mr. guber and mr. peters say they got a look at the books and balked at the price 
 their relationship with mr. sugarman <unk> shortly thereafter 
 last may he sold his N N stake in <unk> to a passive australian investor and <unk> was renamed guber peters entertainment co 
 meanwhile mr. guber and mr. peters had agreed to extend their warner agreement with the new five-year exclusive contract 
 the new deal was considered the most generous of its kind both financially and in terms of creative freedom 
 but it <unk> by comparison to what sony was to offer last month the chance at last to run a major studio about $ N million in deferred compensation up to N N of columbia 's future cash flow N N of the future appreciation of columbia 's market value and annual salaries of $ N million for each 
 the producers ' N N share of publicly held guber peters would net them an additional $ N million 
 sony also agreed to <unk> the producers against any liability to warner 
 sony is paying a hefty price for a company that had revenue of only $ N million last year 
 and earnings have been <unk> 
 in the the latest quarter thanks in part to batman guber peters earned $ N million or N cents a share compared to a loss of $ N million or N cents a share in last year 's quarter 
 guber peters stock which traded as low as $ N a share last year closed yesterday at $ N 
 the two sides now are <unk> each other of lying 
 mr. guber and mr. peters claim they have an oral agreement with warner executives that allows them to terminate their contract should the opportunity to run a major studio arise 
 but in affidavits filed yesterday in the los angeles court mr. ross warner bros. chairman robert daly and president semel deny that such an oral agreement was ever made 
 warner in its court filings calls it a piece of <unk> created for this litigation 
 mr. daly in his affidavit acknowledges that warner agreed to release the producers last year to take over mgm but says that situation was altogether different 
 for one thing according to mr. daly the producers requested a release in advance 
 moreover the old contract was about to expire and the lineup of guber peters pictures for warner was n't as strong as it is now 
 warner itself was in negotiations with mgm over certain movie and other rights and it was in warner 's interest to accommodate mgm\/ua guber and peters by permitting them to become mgm executives mr. daly said in his affidavit 
 warner obviously does n't think that it is in its own interests to let mr. guber and mr. peters go off to columbia 
 at the very least mr. ross clearly sees an opportunity to use the two men to get a pound of <unk> from sony 
 during settlement talks for example warner demanded such things as cable tv rights to columbia movies and columbia 's interest in the studio it jointly owns with warner according to executives involved in the talks 
 in any settlement warner is almost certain to demand rights to most of the N or so projects mr. guber and mr. peters have locked up for the next few years notably <unk> to batman 
 mr. guber and mr. peters refuse to concede that they may have made a tactical error in accepting the sony offer before taking it up with warner 
 and they say there are plenty of <unk> in hollywood for letting people out of contracts 
 the last time columbia pictures was looking for a studio chief they note warner released producer david <unk> from his contract then took him back after he was subsequently fired by his bosses at columbia 
 in his affidavit filed yesterday warner 's mr. ross indicated he is n't buying any such argument if sony succeeds here no written contract in hollywood will be worth the paper it 's written on 
 the sales pitch could n't sound better 
 first there 's the name asset-backed securities 
 better than all those offers you get to buy securities backed by nothing 
 and there 's more 
 the assets backing the securities come from some of the country 's biggest and most secure institutions 
 most earn high ratings from credit agencies 
 their yields are higher than those of u.s. treasury issues 
 and the booming market has already attracted many of the nation 's biggest institutional investors 
 ready to jump 
 well think twice 
 the concept may be simple take a bunch of loans tie them up in one neat package and sell pieces of the package to investors 
 but the <unk> may be misleading 
 skeptics say the slightly higher returns are n't enough to compensate for the extra risk 
 they warn that asset-backed securities are only as good as the assets and credit backing that support them and those are hard to evaluate 
 moreover the securities were introduced only about N N years ago the biggest unknown is how they will fare in a recession 
 a lot of this stuff really is in <unk> waters says owen <unk> director of the investment securities division of the u.s. comptroller of the currency 
 we do n't know how this whole market will work in a serious economic downturn 
 such concerns however have n't stopped asset-backed securities from becoming one of wall street 's hottest new products 
 since the spring of N financial <unk> have transformed a wide variety of debt into these new securities 
 they have sold issues backed by car loans boat loans and <unk> loans 
 they have offered <unk> of <unk> loans as well as packages of loans used to buy vacation <unk> 
 last year there was an issue of <unk> bonds securities backed by loans to life-insurance policyholders 
 some predict there will be third world bonds backed by loans to brazil argentina and other <unk> nations 
 and the biggest volume this year has been on securities backed by credit-card receivables sometimes known as plastic bonds 
 this is the <unk> of debt says james grant editor of grant 's interest rate <unk> a newsletter 
 before the sun sets on the '80s it seems nothing will be left <unk> 
 the result is a $ N billion market according to securities data co 
 that includes more than $ N billion issued through august of this year up sharply from $ N billion in the comparable N period and more than in all of N 
 most issues have been sold to professional money managers pension funds bank trust departments and other institutions 
 but wealthy individuals also have been jumping in and lately brokers have been pushing smaller investors into the asset-backed market 
 the entry fee is affordable issues typically are sold in minimum denominations of $ N 
 we expect additional offerings of asset-backed securities targeted toward individual investors says bill <unk> a senior vice president at shearson lehman hutton inc 
 the process typically begins when an institution such as citibank or sears roebuck & co. takes a pool of credit-card or other receivables and sells them to a specially created trust 
 the trust then issues securities generally due in five years or less that are underwritten by wall street brokerage firms and offered to investors 
 issues typically come with credit <unk> such as a bank letter of credit and thus have received high credit ratings 
 enthusiasts say the booming market has opened up a valuable new source of funds to issuers while providing a valuable new investment for individuals and institutions 
 asset-backed securities are an attractive investment compared to bank certificates of deposit or other corporate bonds says craig j. goldberg managing director and head of the asset-backed securities group at merrill lynch capital markets 
 but skeptics question whether asset-backed bonds offer sufficient rewards to compensate for the extra risks 
 consider a $ N million offering of N N securities issued last spring and backed by citibank credit-card receivables 
 the <unk> issue offered a yield of only about N percentage point above four-year treasury issues 
 on a $ N investment that 's a difference of only $ N a year 
 that kind of spread can be critical for money managers who buy bonds in large quantities and whose <unk> depends on <unk> the money manager across the street 
 but for individuals who buy much smaller amounts and care less about relative performance than in preserving what they have that margin is <unk> 
 if you 're in the bond business playing the <unk> <unk> then even an extra N basis points N percentage point becomes an important consideration on a career basis says mr. grant 
 but if you 're an individual investing money and trying to get it back again then that is n't of overwhelming importance 
 moreover the interest on asset-backed securities is fully taxable while interest on treasury issues is tax-free at the state and local level 
 that 's why some investment managers such as alex powers a vice president of chase manhattan bank 's private banking division do n't recommend most asset-backed issues for individuals in <unk> states such as new york or california 
 but mr. powers has purchased asset-backed issues for individuals with <unk> accounts such as retirement plans 
 he points out that institutions buying asset-backed issues in large quantities can earn higher spreads over treasurys than individuals buying smaller amounts 
 another concern is liquidity or how easily a security can be converted into cash 
 the secondary or resale market for asset-backed securities is relatively new and much less active than for treasury issues 
 that could make it tricky for investors who need to sell their holdings quickly before the securities mature 
 that 's particularly true analysts say for certain of the securities such as those backed by <unk> loans 
 you could see massive gyrations here because it 's such a <unk> traded market says jonathan s. paris a vice president of european investors inc. a new york <unk> firm 
 in addition an investor who wants to know the daily value of treasury bonds or corporate bonds traded on the new york stock exchange can simply check newspaper listings 
 there are n't any such listings for asset-backed securities 
 evaluating asset-backed securities <unk> another problem 
 investors for instance may mistakenly assume that the bank or company that originally held the assets is <unk> the securities 
 it is n't 
 the front cover of the prospectus for the citibank credit-card receivables offering points out in bold capital letters that the certificates represent an interest only in the specially created trust and do not represent interests in or obligations of the banks citibank <unk> citicorp or any affiliate <unk> 
 in other words if there 's a problem do n't expect citibank to come to the rescue 
 the prospectus also notes that the securities are not guaranteed by any government agency 
 that means investors have to focus on the quality of the debt that lies beneath the securities as well as on the credit <unk> for the issue and the credit ratings the issue has received 
 that also is n't easy 
 take the credit <unk> which typically include a bank letter of credit or insurance from a <unk> company 
 the letter of credit typically is not offered by the bank selling the assets to back the securities 
 nor does it cover the entire portfolio 
 details of credit <unk> vary widely from issue to issue 
 still they play a crucial role in winning top ratings for most asset-backed issues which in turn is why the yield above treasurys is so slim 
 but skeptics ask why you should bother buying this stuff when you can get only slightly lower yields on <unk> paper 
 when you buy an asset-backed issue you take the risk that a bank or an insurer could run into unexpected difficulties 
 if a bank 's credit rating was lowered because of say its loans to third world nations that could also affect the ratings liquidity and prices of the asset-backed issues that the bank supports 
 underwriters insist these issues are constructed to withstand extremely tough economic conditions 
 but despite the credit <unk> despite the high ratings some money managers still worry that a recession could <unk> havoc on the underlying assets 
 at a time when americans are leveraged to their <unk> asset-backed investors may be taking a <unk> gamble that consumers will be able to repay loans in hard times 
 at the very least a recession would prompt investors to buy the <unk> bonds they can find that is treasurys 
 that could widen the yield spread between treasurys and asset-backed securities as well as make it tougher to unload the latter 
 but it could be much worse 
 some analysts are especially wary of credit-card issues 
 for one thing credit-card loans are unsecured 
 in addition they fear that banks have been <unk> to issue cards to the public giving cards to too many big <unk> who will default during a recession 
 a day of <unk> is coming where we think the market will place a high premium on the <unk> debt issues and therefore we think the best debt investment is u.s. government bonds says craig <unk> of <unk> futures inc. an investment advisory firm 
 what about <unk> asset-backed issues 
 <unk> we still say to stick with treasurys mr. <unk> replies 
 ratings he notes are subject to change 
 all this makes asset-backed securities seem too risky for many people 
 and it <unk> raymond f. devoe jr. a market strategist at legg mason wood walker inc. of what he calls devoe 's <unk> but highly probable theory no. N

 if you force financial planners to sum up their most important advice in a single sentence it would probably be a <unk> sentence diversify 
 judging by a poll of wall street journal readers conducted this summer by <unk> & morgan inc. serious investors have taken that advice to heart 
 nearly N investors responded to the journal 's poll providing an <unk> look at their portfolios 
 those portfolios are <unk> diversified 
 by spreading their wealth among several investment alternatives the respondents have protected themselves against <unk> in any one area be it stocks bonds or real estate 
 for example about N N of journal readers owned stock down slightly from N N in a similar poll last year 
 but only N N said they had more than half their money in the stock market 
 similarly N N of respondents own shares in a money-market mutual fund and N N own municipal bonds 
 but only N N to N N of the investors were committing more than half their funds to either of those alternatives 
 the poll conducted aug. N also provides a <unk> into the thinking of serious investors on a variety of other topics 
 it found them in a cautious but not <unk> mood 
 of N people sent a <unk> N replied 
 the response rate more than N N allows the results to be interpreted with a high degree of confidence 
 the results ca n't be <unk> to all investors though 
 journal readers are relatively affluent with a median household income of between $ N and $ N 
 nearly half of the respondents N N said their investment portfolio was worth $ N or more and N N said it was worth $ N million or more 
 the respondents were mildly optimistic about the economy and investment markets but their collective judgments were a <unk> more <unk> than they were a year ago 
 for example N N of this year 's respondents said they expect a recession within N months 
 last year only N N were expecting a recession 
 an additional N N of this year 's respondents expect the economy to slow down during the next N months 
 only N N of last year 's respondents anticipated slowing growth 
 apparently the respondents do n't think that an economic slowdown would harm the major investment markets very much 
 a slim majority N N think stock prices will be higher in august N than they were in august N 
 their verdict on real estate is almost the same 
 some N N expect real estate in their local area to increase in value over the next N months 
 by contrast only N N expect an increase in the price of gold 
 since gold tends to soar when inflation is high that finding suggests that people believe inflation remains under control 
 even though only N N actually predicted a recession many respondents were taking a <unk> sorry investment stance 
 nearly a third said they have made some portfolio changes to anticipate a possible recession 
 for the most part the changes were slight 
 the two-thirds who have n't tried to make their portfolios more <unk> were split about evenly between investors who do n't believe in trying to predict the markets about N N and investors who do n't expect a recession about N N or are <unk> if and when a recession might come about N N 
 a <unk> approach to stocks continues to be the rule among respondents 
 most own two to N stocks and buy or sell no more than three times a year 
 some N N had bought some stock in the past year only N N had sold any 
 but the <unk> shadow of N 's stock-market crash still seems dark 
 about N N considered another crash likely while about N N said one is unlikely 
 those <unk> hardly changed from the previous year 's poll 
 and the respondents ' commitment to the stock market remains somewhat lighter than usual 
 about N N of them said they would ordinarily have at least N N of their money in stocks 
 but as of august only N N actually had stock-market investments of that size 
 most stock-market indexes were hitting <unk> highs at around the time of the poll 
 but it appears that many journal readers were taking that news as a sign to be cautious rather than a signal to jump on the <unk>

 it was five in the afternoon but that was pacific time 
 back in new york the work day was already over so i did n't have to feel guilty

 this <unk> the stick was not a classic baseball stadium too <unk> too much <unk> concrete 
 and it did n't have the crowded wild <unk> of yankee stadium 
 but i liked the easy <unk> of the people around me liked it that they 'd brought their children found it <unk> that true citizens of the state of the future they had brought so many tvs and <unk> to stay in touch with <unk> at a live event 
 maybe it was their <unk> sense of history 
 the broadcasters were after all <unk> the game <unk> its <unk> for millions outside the stick 
 why not watch or hear your experience <unk> while you were living it 
 the day was <unk> with the weight of its own impending history 
 long lines of people waited to buy special <unk> world series <unk> with official <unk> 
 thousands of us had paid $ N for the official <unk> book with its historical <unk> on series <unk> its historical photographs of great moments in series past and its instructions in english and spanish for filling in the <unk> 
 <unk> <unk> <unk> 
 <unk> <unk> <unk> 
 players ran out on the field way below and the stands began to <unk> 
 it must be a local custom i thought <unk> feet to welcome the team 
 but then the noise turned into a <unk> 
 and no one was shouting 
 no one around me was saying anything 
 because we all were busy riding a wave 
 <unk> thousand <unk> <unk> a concrete wall waiting for the <unk> 
 only at the moment of maximum roll did i grasp what was going on 
 then i remembered the quake of <unk> which i experienced in santa barbara in a <unk> motel room 
 when the <unk> of the building <unk> me up i <unk> that a i was in southern california b the bed was moving c it must be a magic fingers bed that had <unk> 
 then i noticed the overhead light was <unk> on its <unk> and realized what had happened 
 what should i do 
 get out of the possibly <unk> building to the parking lot 
 but the lot might split into <unk> so i had better stand on my car which probably was wider than the average <unk> 
 fortunately the quake was over before i managed to run out and stand naked on the <unk> 
 at the stick while the world shook i thought of that morning and then it struck me that this time was different 
 if i survived i would have achieved every journalist 's highest wish 
 i was an <unk> of the most <unk> event on the planet at that moment 
 what was my <unk> 
 how would i file 
 all these thoughts <unk> through my head in the N seconds of the earthquake 's actual <unk> 
 the rest is of course history 
 the stick did n't fall 
 the real <unk> occurred elsewhere as we soon found out 
 but for a few minutes there relief <unk> 
 a young mother found her boy who had been out buying a <unk> 
 the wall behind me was slightly <unk> but the center had held 
 and most of us waited for a while for the game to start 
 then we began to file out to wait <unk> on <unk> <unk> for the opening pitch 
 it was during the quiet exodus down the <unk> concrete <unk> of the stick that i really understood the point of all those <unk> and <unk> 
 the crowd moved in <unk> <unk> <unk> around an electronic <unk> 
 in this way while the stick itself was <unk> out we kept up to date on events 
 within N minutes of the quake itself i was able to see pictures of the collapsed section of the bay bridge 
 increasingly accurate estimates of the <unk> of the quake became available before i got to my car 
 and by then expensive automobile sound systems were keeping the <unk> parking lot by the bay informed about the fire causing the big black <unk> of smoke we saw on the northern horizon 
 <unk> fell 
 but the <unk> continued through the <unk> night with pictures of the <unk> highway <unk> in oakland and <unk> in the marina district 
 by then our little sand village of cars had been linked with a global village of <unk> and viewers 
 everyone at the stick that day had started out as a <unk> and ended up as a participant 
 in fact the entire population of the bay area had ended up with this dual role of actor and audience 
 the reporters were victims and some of the victims turned into <unk> reporters 
 the outstanding example of this was the <unk> on the bay bridge who had the presence of mind to take out a video camera at the absolutely crucial moment and record the car in front as it fell into the gap in the roadway

 investors who received shearson lehman hutton inc. 's latest stock commentary may be left with blank <unk> 
 the first N pages of the <unk> weekly portfolio perspective are completely blank except for the page numbers 
 rather than printing <unk> shearson puts all the blame on the <unk> stock market 
 the plunge made shearson 's market commentary instantly out of date 
 in fact last friday 's 190.58-point tumble in the stock market caught many people and businesses by surprise not the least of them brokerage firms such as shearson that print their weekly market <unk> on <unk> for <unk> the following week 
 shearson a <unk> unit of american express co. did n't have enough time to update its market commentary so we decided to kill our strategy pieces says jack <unk> the head of shearson 's research department 
 the first thought some investors had was that a <unk> shearson must have been wildly bullish on stocks in its original commentary and that 's why it <unk> its pages 
 investors recalled that shearson last week had been advising that the market is still <unk> all the signs of a further advance 
 many other brokerage firms had similarly bullish views 
 but mr. <unk> insists that the N pages were n't pulled because they were too bullish 
 instead he says they were cautious and that was n't the message we wanted to deliver on monday 
 as mr. <unk> explains it we were raising some caution flags about rate rises in europe and concerns about the lbo market 
 and by late friday afternoon actually after the close we decided that was the wrong tone to take 
 with the market down we wanted to tell people to put their orders in on the opening 
 both before and after the friday plunge shearson has maintained a recommended portfolio <unk> of N N stocks N N bonds and N N cash

 china 's slide toward recession is beginning to look like a free fall 
 in a report on china 's <unk> economy the official state statistical bureau disclosed that industrial output last month rose N N from a year earlier the lowest growth rate in a decade for september 
 retail sales are <unk> while consumer prices still are rising 
 chinese and foreign economists now predict prolonged <unk> low growth and high inflation 
 the economy is <unk> hard says an asian economist in beijing 
 the slowdown is taking hold a lot more quickly and <unk> than anyone had expected 
 a lengthy recession if it <unk> would drain state <unk> and create severe <unk> for urban workers 
 experts predict the coming year will be characterized by flat or negative industrial growth rising unemployment and a widening budget deficit 
 unless the government suddenly <unk> course wages for most workers wo n't keep pace with inflation creating a potential source of urban unrest 
 the economy 's slowdown is due only partly to the <unk> program launched in september N to cool an <unk> economy and <unk> inflation 
 industrial output surged N N in N while inflation peaked last february at nearly N N 
 the slowdown also results from <unk> energy and <unk> shortages that force many factories to restrict operations to two or three days a week 
 in western <unk> countries recessions often have a bright side <unk> the economy to greater efficiency 
 in china however there is n't likely to be any silver <unk> because the economy remains <unk> primarily by the state 
 instead china is likely to shell out <unk> subsidies to its <unk> <unk> enterprises which <unk> up $ N billion in <unk> last year 
 nor are any of these inefficient <unk> likely to be allowed to go bankrupt 
 rather the brunt of the slowdown will be felt in the fast-growing private and <unk> township enterprises which have fallen into <unk> as china 's leaders <unk> an orthodox marxist preference for public ownership 
 when the going gets rough china <unk> the efficient and rewards the incompetent says a western economist 
 reports of an economy near recession come as officials prepare a major communist party <unk> for sometime in the next few weeks 
 the meeting is expected to call for heightened <unk> for two years 
 but with industrial growth <unk> and inflation showing signs of easing some voices may call for measures to pump new life into the economy 
 some analysts believe china soon will begin <unk> economic controls particularly by <unk> credit 
 that would benefit chinese enterprises as well as <unk> joint ventures both of which have been plagued by shortages of working capital 
 a dangerous buildup this year of billions of dollars in <unk> debts threatens if <unk> to bring the economy to a collapse 
 one sign of a possible easing of credit policy was the decision this week of people 's bank of china the central bank to <unk> $ N billion in short-term loans to pay farmers for the autumn harvest the official china daily reported 
 but while pumping more money into the economy would bring relief to many industries it also runs the risk of triggering another period of runaway growth and steep inflation 
 the cycle has been repeated several times since china began <unk> its planned economy in N 
 and because china 's leaders have abandoned plans to drastically reform the economy it is likely to continue analysts say 
 the statistical bureau 's report cited in china daily notes that industrial output in september totaled $ N billion a rise of just N N from a year earlier 
 output declined in several provinces including <unk> and <unk> two key coastal areas and <unk> the nation 's agricultural <unk> 
 production in shanghai china 's industrial powerhouse and the largest source of tax revenue for the central government fell N N for the month 
 nationwide output of light industrial products declined N N the first decline in N years a bureau spokesman told china daily 
 in an unusually direct statement the bureau spokesman recommended that state banks extend more credit to <unk> so that they can purchase manufacturers ' goods 
 this will prevent a slide in industrial production which will otherwise cause new panic <unk> the spokesman said 
 the N tax overhaul the biggest achievement of president reagan 's second term is beginning to fall apart and interest groups are <unk> up for tax <unk> all over capitol hill 
 real-estate executives are lobbying to ease <unk> rules 
 charitable groups are trying to <unk> the write-off for contributions made by individuals who do n't <unk> their deductions 
 big auction houses want to make <unk> eligible for lower capital-gains taxes 
 and <unk> lobbyists are quietly discussing the possibility of <unk> the investment tax credit 
 everything is up for <unk> says <unk> <unk> a lobbyist for mutual life-insurance companies 
 adds robert <unk> the head lobbyist for a variety of interests that want to protect the tax deduction for travel and entertainment expenses it appears as though the whole thing is wide open again 
 the catalyst has been the congressional move to restore <unk> tax treatment for capital gains an effort that is likely to succeed in this congress 
 other fundamental reforms of the N act have been threatened as well 
 the house seriously considered raising the top tax rate paid by individuals with the highest incomes 
 the senate finance committee voted to expand the deduction for individual retirement accounts and also to bring back income averaging for farmers a tax preference that allows income to be spread out over several years 
 as part of the same bill the finance panel also voted in favor of billions of dollars in narrow tax breaks for individuals and corporations in what committee member sen. david <unk> d. ark calls a feeding frenzy of special-interest <unk> 
 the beneficiaries would range from <unk> growers to rich <unk> to <unk> shops 
 to be sure the full senate facing a <unk> budget deadline last friday stripped away all of the tax breaks that were contained in the finance committee bill 
 but lawmakers of both parties agree that the streamlining was temporary 
 other bills will be moving soon that are expected to carry many of the tax cuts including both the capital-gains and ira provisions 
 there is n't any doubt that the <unk> of the <unk> code has been given a mighty <unk> says rep. thomas downey d. n.y 
 you 'll see the annual <unk> of it

 referring to the chairmen of the senate and house <unk> committees he adds next year every special-interest group is going to be there knocking on lloyd <unk> 's door on danny <unk> 's door 
 many groups are n't waiting that long 
 just last week a house ways and means subcommittee held a lengthy meeting to hear the <unk> of individual cities companies and interest groups who want to open their own special <unk> 
 it 's a <unk> factory and the <unk> <unk> pretty good <unk> one veteran lobbyist who was watching the proceedings 
 even lobbyists for heavy industry one of the interests hit hardest in the N bill are encouraged 
 the return of <unk> tax breaks such as those for capital gains and iras creates more of a mood or a <unk> that is helpful for getting better depreciation write-offs or investment credits says paul <unk> a vice president for the national association of manufacturers 
 corporate lobbyist <unk> walker is planning a spring conference to discuss what tax changes to make to improve competitiveness 
 in reaction to proposed capital-gains legislation groups are lobbying to make sure they are n't left off the <unk> train 
 real-estate interests for example are <unk> an <unk> in president bush 's capital-gains proposal it does n't include real-estate gains 
 if there is going to be a tax scheme that <unk> lower treatment of capital gains they certainly want to be part of it says real-estate lobbyist wayne <unk> of concord associates 
 in the house-passed tax bill mr. <unk> got his wish real-estate assets are included in the capital-gains provision 
 but sotheby 's christie 's and the national association of <unk> dealers are still trying to get theirs 
 they have sent a letter to congressional <unk> asking that gains from the sale of <unk> also be given <unk> treatment 
 <unk> should continue to be recognized as capital assets the letter states 
 all of this talk is <unk> to the tax reform act of N 
 in exchange for dramatically lower tax rates the <unk> of that legislation sought to eliminate most of the <unk> deductions and credits that gave some taxpayers an advantage over others 
 the goal was to tax people with roughly equivalent incomes equally and to eliminate the many shelters that allowed the wealthy to escape taxes 
 two of the major ways that <unk> managed to <unk> these ends were to scrap the <unk> treatment of capital gains and to curtail the use of paper losses also known as passive losses that made many tax shelters possible 
 many other tax benefits also were <unk> away 
 this year congress with <unk> from president bush has been busy trying to put many of these same tax preferences back into the code 
 it appears likely that this year or next some form of capital-gains preference and <unk> restoration will be enacted 
 other tax benefits probably will be restored and created 
 the main obstacle is finding a way to pay for them 
 the <unk> act was a <unk> 
 they wanted reform and they got a revolution says overhaul advocate rep. <unk> <unk> r. ohio 
 so is the tax code now open game again 
 mr. <unk> thinks so

 his last published novel featuring private <unk> philip marlowe the <unk> <unk> N at times read almost like a <unk> of his previous work 
 when he died in N chandler left behind four <unk> of yet another marlowe book the <unk> springs story which seemed to go beyond <unk> into something like <unk> 
 <unk> chandler 's last pitch apparently was a <unk> 
 now robert parker author of several best sellers featuring <unk> a contemporary private eye in the marlowe <unk> has with the <unk> of the chandler estate been hired to complete the <unk> springs story 
 the result <unk> springs <unk> 's N pages $ N is an entertaining easy to read and fairly <unk> extension of the marlowe <unk> full of <unk> <unk> and california color

 philip and linda move into her mansion and ca n't keep their hands off each other even in front of the <unk> <unk> 
 but the <unk> have a conflict 
 he wants to continue being a <unk> private eye and she wants him to live off the million dollars she 's settled on him 
 that 's chandler 's <unk> 
 mr. parker <unk> it into a pretty satisfying tale involving <unk> springs high life hollywood low life and various folk who hang their hats in both <unk> 
 the supporting lineup is solid the <unk> is amusing and there 's even a <unk> by <unk> <unk> the good <unk> of previous chandler books who still does n't hesitate to have marlowe jailed when it suits his purposes 
 the style throughout bears a strong <unk> to chandler 's <unk> at its most <unk> down 
 all told mr. parker does a better job of making a novel out of this abandoned <unk> than anyone might have had a right to expect 
 but there are grounds for complaint 
 at one point the reader is two steps ahead of marlowe in catching on to a double identity <unk> and marlowe is supposed to be the pro 
 more <unk> there are several apparent <unk> 
 contact lenses tank tops <unk> openly working the streets of hollywood and the <unk> <unk> <unk> all seem out of place in the 1950s

 the japanese take the long view said mr. <unk> 
 it may not be weeks or months but they are also <unk> and if they feel comfortable they will move on a deal he said 
 in recent months three big tokyo-based publishing concerns including nikkei business publications nikkei home no <unk> and magazine house applied for membership in magazine publishers of america which represents almost all u.s. consumer magazines 
 japanese involvement in american publishing has been so small to date that magazines such as business tokyo are considered <unk>

 business lines increased N N to N million 
 on a truly comparable basis we 've seen modest earnings growth this year from the operations of our company said jack <unk> chairman and chief executive officer 
 the major negative factor was the cumulative impact of regulatory activity over the past two years 
 he said the company expects to be on target with analysts ' projections by year end but conceded that the fourth quarter represents a significant challenge

 most of the higher costs were associated with acquisitions and growth in <unk> business units it added 
 our net income is n't where we would want it to be at this point said william c. ferguson chairman and chief executive officer 
 this deviation from our past growth patterns is caused largely by lower earnings at new york telephone 
 mr. ferguson said a continued softness in new york city area 's economy and increased competition particularly in the <unk> market took a heavy toll on earnings

 for retailers christmas not halloween promises to be this year 's <unk> season 
 many retailers fear a price war will <unk> if <unk> companies such as campeau corp. slash <unk> to spur sales 
 concerns about the stock market doubts about the economy in general and rising competition from catalog companies also <unk> store operators 
 profits at christmas could be under attack for every retailer asserts norman abramson president and chief operating officer of <unk> inc. an <unk> chain 
 even if there is n't any widespread discounting the outlook for industry profits is n't good 
 management <unk> forecasts a N N profit decline for <unk> retailers this year after annual drops that averaged N N in N and N 
 for the last two and a half years retailing has been in a mild recession says carl <unk> chief economist at the columbus ohio consulting firm 
 this year many stores are entering the christmas season in turmoil <unk> teller and b. altman parent l.j. hooker corp. is operating under chapter N of the federal bankruptcy code b.a.t industries plc 's healthy saks fifth avenue and marshall field 's chains are on the auction block campeau 's bloomingdale 's is also on the block 
 industry observers expect a wide divergence in performance 
 stores in a state of confusion are likely to fare poorly and to lose customers to stable chains such as limited inc. may department stores co. and <unk> department stores inc. which should do well 
 there are going to be very clear winners and very clear losers says cynthia <unk> a <unk> ross & co. retail consultant 
 says mr. <unk> i 'm looking for a <unk> christmas 
 economists expect general merchandise sales in the fourth quarter to rise N N to N N from year-ago figures 
 but mr. <unk> predicts that healthy stores <unk> mostly apparel could ring up gains of as much as N N to N N 
 troubled chains could see their sales drop as much as N N he believes as managers <unk> by fears about the future allow their stores to get sloppy 
 thin merchandise <unk> at the most troubled chains are also expected to hurt sales 
 catalog companies are likely to pose a bigger threat to all stores this year particularly in december 
 more than N catalog <unk> are promoting a low-cost federal express service that guarantees <unk> delivery of orders made by a certain date 
 traditionally consumers were concerned about ordering after the first of december because they did n't believe they would get it by christmas says <unk> <unk> chairman of the wine <unk> inc. which sells wine <unk> and accessories through the mail 
 using federal express delivery last year mr. <unk> says december was our biggest month 
 even sears roebuck & co. is getting into the act offering for the first time to have federal express deliver toys ordered by dec. N from its wish book catalog 
 k mart corp. chairman joseph e. <unk> <unk> up his outlook for the christmas season as not troublesome 
 he 's not predicting a blockbuster but he is more optimistic than three months ago because employment remains strong and inflation low 
 other retailers are also preparing for a <unk> holiday 
 philip m. <unk> chairman of carter <unk> <unk> stores inc. expects sales at department stores open at least a year to rise a modest N N to N N over last year 's totals both for his company and the industry in general

 mr. sells expects fourth-quarter sales at his company which besides woolworth stores includes <unk> and foot <unk> <unk> stores and other specialty chains to rise pretty much in line with its <unk> increases of between N N and N N 
 the estimate includes the results of new stores 
 a consumer poll conducted in early september by leo j. shapiro & associates a market researcher based in chicago also suggests a modest holiday 
 of the N survey respondents N N said they expect to spend less buying christmas gifts this year than last year while N N said they expect to spend more and N N said their gift budget would stay the same 
 the results are almost identical to shapiro 's september N numbers 
 retailers could get a boost this year from the calendar 
 christmas falls on a monday creating a big last-minute weekend opportunity for stores 
 most will stay open late saturday night and open their doors again sunday 
 but many consumers probably will use the extra time to put off some purchasing until the last minute 
 what you 'll hear as we get into december is that sales are sluggish predicts woolworth 's mr. sells 
 the week ending the <unk> is going to save the entire month for everyone 
 the spanish author <unk> jose cela won the nobel prize for literature yesterday a surprising choice but given the swedish academy 's past <unk> hardly the most <unk> and ridiculous <unk> handed out by the <unk> committee

 unlike other writers who either battled the <unk> during the civil war or left spain when franco <unk> mr. cela fought briefly on the general 's side no doubt earning with his war wound some <unk> when he went on to <unk> a country with a high population of <unk> <unk> and rural <unk> <unk> <unk> through a <unk> land

 the company earned $ N million or $ N a share on revenue of $ N billion in the year-ago fourth quarter 
 for fiscal N ashland had net of $ N million or $ N a share on revenue of $ N billion

 ashland expects that sale to be complete next year 
 the charge for the <unk> subsidiary is for expected costs to correct problems with certain bed <unk> built for utilities 
 the charge will be added to $ N million in reserves established a year ago to cover the cost overruns 
 when president bush <unk> here next week for a <unk> summit organized to <unk> a century of costa rican democracy will he be able to deliver a credible message in the wake of the panamanian <unk> 
 undoubtedly mr. bush will be praised by some latin leaders prone to pay <unk> service to <unk> while they privately encourage more <unk> u.s. action to remove gen. manuel noriega and <unk> their countries from a sandinista <unk> 
 the panamanian affair is only the tip of a more <unk> <unk> 
 it <unk> in a bush administration decision not to <unk> the u.s. congress and avoid at all costs being accused of <unk> in the region 
 the result has been a dangerous vacuum of u.s. leadership which leaves central america open to soviet <unk> 
 the influence of the u.s. is not being felt in central america washington 's decisions do not respond to a policy and are <unk> from reality says fernando <unk> a costa rican congressman and former foreign minister 
 the disarray of the bush administration 's latin <unk> was evident in the failure of the organization of american states to condemn <unk> gen. noriega 
 faced with this embarrassment u.s. diplomats expressed confidence that the influential <unk> group of south american nations which gathered last week in peru would take a stronger posture toward the panamanian dictator 
 but other than a few <unk> on the <unk> gen. noriega went <unk> by that body too he was not even singled out in the closing statement 
 now mr. bush will come to costa rica and <unk> nicaraguan <unk> daniel ortega eager for photo opportunities with the u.s. president 
 the host costa rican president <unk> arias did not <unk> chile cuba panama or <unk> to the summit which was to be restricted to <unk> 
 however mr. ortega was included 
 formally upgrading the sandinistas to a democratic status was an initiative <unk> criticized in the costa rican press 
 even carlos manuel <unk> the presidential candidate for mr. arias 's national liberation party made public his opposition to the presence of nicaragua in a democratic <unk> 
 nevertheless the bush administration agreed to the dubious arrangement in july a few weeks before the central american presidents met in <unk> honduras to discuss a timetable for <unk> the <unk> rebels 
 according to officials in washington the state department hoped that by <unk> president arias it would gain his support to postpone any decision on the contras until after mr. ortega 's promises of democratic elections were tested next february 
 however relying on an <unk> critic of the reagan administration and the contra movement for help in delaying the <unk> of the contras was risky business 
 and even some last-minute phone calls that mr. bush made at the <unk> of some conservative u.s. senators to <unk> backing for the u.s. position failed to stop the march of mr. arias 's agenda 
 prior to this episode sen. christopher dodd d. conn. <unk> an open field <unk> a personal diplomatic mission through central america to promote an early <unk> of the rebels 
 visiting nicaragua he praised the sandinistas for their electoral system and <unk> the bush administration for not rewarding the sandinistas 
 in honduras where the contras are a hot political issue he promised to help <unk> some $ N million in assistance withheld due to the failure of local agencies to comply with conditions agreed upon with washington 
 aid was also the <unk> of the talks sen. dodd had with <unk> president <unk> <unk> mr. <unk> 's government is very much at the <unk> of u.s. <unk> and is forced to listen very carefully to sen. dodd 's likes and <unk> 
 it was therefore not surprising that close allies of the u.s. virtually neglected by the bush administration ordered the nicaraguan <unk> <unk> by december long before the elections 
 <unk> the <unk> accords were <unk> by <unk> the dodd plan 
 the individual foreign policy carried out by u.s. legislators adds to a confusing u.s. performance that has <unk> soviet initiatives in central america 
 on oct. N following conversations with secretary of state james baker soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze arrived in managua to <unk> nicaragua 's great peace efforts 
 there mr. shevardnadze felt <unk> to unveil his own peace plan the u.s.s.r. would <unk> a suspension of arms shipments to nicaragua after the february election if the u.s. did likewise with its allies in central america 
 he also called on nicaragua 's neighbors to accept a military <unk> guaranteed by both <unk> 
 the pentagon claims that in spite of moscow 's words east bloc weapons continue to flow into nicaragua through cuba at <unk> levels 
 since mr. shevardnadze 's proposals followed discussions with mr. baker <unk> arose that the bush administration was seeking an <unk> with the soviets in central america 
 this scheme would fit the arias plan which declared a false <unk> between soviet military aid to the sandinista <unk> and that provided by washington to freely elected governments 
 furthermore it is also likely to encourage those on capitol hill asking for cuts in the assistance to el salvador if president <unk> does not <unk> to demands of the marxist guerrillas 
 the sad condition of u.s. policy in central america is best <unk> by the recent end to u.s. <unk> of radio costa rica 
 in N the costa rican government requested help to establish a radio station in the northern part of the country flooded by <unk> of sandinista propaganda 
 recovering <unk> sovereignty was the purpose of radio costa rica funded by the u.s. and affiliated with the voice of america <unk> 
 a few months ago the bush administration decided to stop this cooperation leaving radio costa rica operating on a <unk> 
 according to news reports the abrupt termination was due to fears that <unk> <unk> could interfere with the peace process 
 in the meantime russia gave nicaragua another powerful radio <unk> which has been installed in the city of <unk> 
 it is capable of reaching the entire caribbean area and deep into north america 
 perhaps its loud signal may generate some awareness of the soviet <unk> being created in the <unk> thanks to u.s. default 
 the soviet <unk> in nicaragua is <unk> for costa rica a peaceful democracy without an army 
 questioned in washington about what would happen if his <unk> peace plan would fail president arias voiced expectations of direct u.s. action 
 a poll conducted in july by a <unk> affiliate showed that N N of costa <unk> believe that if their country is <unk> attacked by either nicaragua or panama the u.s. will come to its defense 
 but in the light of events in panama where the u.s. has such clear strategic interests waiting for the delta force may prove to be a dangerous <unk>

 fox which also owns six tv stations provides programs three nights a week to those and other affiliates

 jamie <unk> president of fox broadcasting said we believe the partnership of fox its affiliates and advertisers is succeeding and will continue to grow 
 another fox official who declined to be identified said fox was n't pleased by the possible <unk> venture into prime-time programming 
 to make the venture work they would need fox affiliates he said

 i think it 's to fox 's advantage to be associated with the <unk> venture said michael conway station manager of <unk> the <unk> station that is a fox affiliate 
 mr. conway said the fox shows appearing on nights when <unk> shows would n't be offered could be <unk> on the programs produced by <unk> 
 michael fisher general manager of <unk> a fox affiliate in sacramento calif. said the real question is whether the <unk> offering is practical 
 it is n't 
 why would i consider giving up fox a proven commodity for an unknown venture

 steel jackets of a type that may have prevented collapse of the columns of a <unk> stretch of the nimitz freeway had been installed on at least a small test section of the <unk> highway last year by california 's department of transportation employees familiar with the project say 
 the test project which reportedly survived tuesday 's earthquake was a prelude to a state plan to <unk> that critical section of the freeway with the steel <unk> 
 state engineers have made a preliminary finding that it was failure of the concrete columns <unk> and <unk> from the <unk> <unk> that was responsible for the collapse 
 the failure in oakland of the freeway segment known as the cypress structure was the <unk> aspect of the quake although officials were hopeful yesterday that the death toll there might be significantly lower than the N initially feared 
 <unk> out the <unk> is expected to take several days 
 red <unk> <unk> picked at the rubble while <unk> tried to break up some of the massive <unk> of concrete 
 giant yellow <unk> were <unk> up alongside the collapsed segment preparing to lift off chunks of the debris 
 in sacramento a transportation department spokesman said he could n't immediately confirm or deny existence of the test work 
 however he asserted that the department had n't <unk> the technology needed to <unk> the entire cypress structure 
 moreover other officials noted <unk> in transportation funding that the state has experienced over the years may have restricted the availability of funds for such a <unk> even if it were <unk> <unk> 
 knowledgeable employees said the <unk> which had n't yet been <unk> was part of a planned <unk> reinforcement of the cypress structure begun by the california transportation department several years ago 
 the cypress reinforcement project itself was part of an annual effort to shore up structures believed vulnerable to earthquakes 
 the state began such work after a N <unk> in southern california when numerous bridges collapsed 
 we had just finished phase two of the cypress project that involved <unk> a series of retaining <unk> designed to prevent sections of the roadway from <unk> as a result of seismic shock a state <unk> engineer said 
 after completing installation of the jackets on one frame of the freeway last year the state <unk> had sent the project over to its sacramento engineers to draw up a final design 
 knowledgeable employees said the project had been <unk> somewhat by the difficulty of designing the jackets 
 the procedure involves <unk> the concrete columns with steel then connecting them more <unk> to the <unk> <unk> 
 the employees also said the project may have been <unk> by budgetary concerns 
 one preliminary estimate put the <unk> cost at as much as $ N million 
 the collapse of the span has provoked surprise and anger among state officials 
 gov. george deukmejian who said he had been assured by state transportation officials that the structure could withstand an even larger quake called for an immediate investigation 
 i want to know who made the decision that it was safe for N people to use every day said richard katz a state legislator who is chairman of the california assembly 's transportation committee 
 he said he would <unk> hearings within two weeks 
 the cypress structure opened in june N and as such like many buildings in the san francisco bay area does not meet current building codes requiring considerably more steel support 
 the northern <unk> of the span lie in <unk> deposits that were of a type to have <unk> easily during the N quake 
 transportation department officials however said they were as surprised as anyone by the cypress destruction 
 they said previous earthquakes suggested that <unk> <unk> would stand up well although they were working on ways to bolster them 
 unfortunately there is only one laboratory for developing techniques to withstand earthquakes and that is an earthquake said <unk> <unk> san francisco district director for the transportation department 
 he said we know of no technology that exists anywhere in the world that would allow us to reinforce the columns

 democracy can be <unk> to politicians sometimes it forces them to make choices 
 now that the supreme court opened the door on the subject of abortion politicians are <unk> under the glare of democratic choice 
 their <unk> is a healthy sign for the rest of us 
 republicans are <unk> most painfully at least at first which is only fair because they 've been <unk> the most 
 so long as abortion was a question for litigation not legislation republicans could find political security in <unk> 
 they could attract <unk> voters by adopting the <unk> movement 's strongest position even as pro-choice republicans knew this <unk> little on an issue <unk> by the court 
 now it matters 
 much of washington thought it detected george bush in a characteristic <unk> on abortion the past week 
 only a month ago he 'd warned congress not to pass legislation to pay for abortions in cases of rape or incest 
 last friday after congress passed it anyway he hinted he was looking for compromise 
 was the man who once was pro-choice but later pro-life converting again 
 in fact mr. bush 's dance was more <unk> than <unk> 
 pro-life advocates say the white house never <unk> over the veto 
 christopher smith r. n.j. a pro-life leader in the house suggested a compromise that would have adapted restrictive language from rape and incest exceptions in the states

 gop <unk> neil newhouse of the <unk> group says polls this summer showed that the <unk> voters had about <unk> out 
 polls are no substitute for principle but they 'll do for some politicians 
 the republican danger is that abortion could become for them what it 's long been for democrats a divisive <unk> test 
 it 's already that in the bush administration at least for any job in which abortion is even <unk> an issue

 their views on health care and welfare did n't much matter though hhs spends billions a year on both 
 it makes only a handful of <unk> decisions 
 though democrats can <unk> at all this for now they may want to contain their <unk> 
 on abortion their own day will come 
 eventually even republicans will find a way to frame the issue in ways that <unk> pro-choice <unk> 
 does the candidate favor parental consent for <unk> abortions 
 the pro-choice lobby does n't 
 what about banning abortions in the second and third <unk> 
 the lobby says no again 
 democracy is forcing the abortion debate toward healthy compromise toward the <unk> middle 
 roe v. wade <unk> political debate so the <unk> <unk> 
 now the <unk> middle a moral majority of sorts is <unk> itself 
 within a few years the outcome in most states is likely to be that abortion will be more restricted but not completely banned

 ever since the <unk> contested america 's cup race last year the famous <unk> match has run into more rough sailing out of the water than in it

 just because stamford conn. high school did nothing when its valuable 1930s mural was thrown in the trash does n't mean the city no longer owns the work of art a federal judge ruled 
 the mural now valued at $ N million according to <unk> was <unk> in a trash <unk> in N by workers who were <unk> the building 
 the <unk> mural painted by james <unk> in N was commissioned by the federal works project administration 
 after the discarded mural was found outside the school by a concerned stamford graduate it eventually was turned over to <unk> hoelzer a professional art <unk> 
 throughout the 1970s stamford school and city officials made no effort to <unk> the mural 
 apparently the officials did n't even know the mural was missing until N when a researcher found that the painting was in mr. hoelzer 's studio and questioned school officials about it 
 in N stamford officials <unk> mr. hoelzer for taking care of the mural and demanded he return it as soon as possible 
 mr. hoelzer however sued stamford claiming that the city had abandoned the <unk> and that it had waited too long to reclaim it 
 but judge louis l. <unk> of federal court in manhattan ruled that the city could n't be <unk> for waiting too long because it did n't realize until N that its ownership of the painting was in dispute 
 the judge also ruled that the painting was n't abandoned because officials did n't intend for it to be thrown away and were <unk> that the <unk> had discarded it 
 mr. hoelzer did n't return phone calls seeking comment on the judge 's decision 
 the judge ordered that a hearing be held nov. N to determine how much the city should pay mr. hoelzer for his services

 the prices of corn futures contracts jumped amid rumors that the soviet union is keeping up its dizzying october buying binge of u.s. corn 
 those rumors were confirmed after the end of trading yesterday when the u.s. agriculture department announced that the soviets had bought N million metric tons of u.s. corn bringing their u.s. corn purchases confirmed so far this month to about five million metric tons 
 in trading at the chicago board of trade the corn contract for december delivery jumped N cents a bushel to settle at $ N a bushel 
 the soviet purchases are close to exceeding what some analysts had expected the soviet union to buy this fall the season in which it usually buys much of the corn it imports from the u.s. 
 that pace is causing some analysts to speculate that the soviet union might soon purchase as much as another two million metric tons 
 one sign that more soviet purchases are possible is that u.s. grain companies yesterday bought an unusually large amount of corn futures contracts 
 that sometimes signals that they are laying plans to export corn 
 by some estimates several grain companies combined bought contracts for the <unk> of roughly one million metric tons of corn 
 by buying futures contracts these companies attempt to protect themselves from swings in the price of the corn that they are obligated to deliver 
 rumors of soviet interest also pushed up the prices of soybean futures contracts 
 among other things the agriculture department is widely thought to be <unk> whether to subsidize the sale of soybean oil to the soviet union 
 on top of all this corn and soybean prices rose on reports that the midwest harvest was disrupted by a <unk> early snow storm that dumped several inches in parts of indiana and ohio 
 the harvest delays however are expected to be temporary 
 <unk> temperatures are forecast for next week said robert <unk> an analyst at farmers grain & livestock corp. chicago 
 many farmers used the jump in prices to sell their recently <unk> crop to grain <unk> companies 
 the heavy selling by farmers helped to damp the price rally 
 wheat futures prices rose slightly 
 in other commodity markets yesterday 
 precious metals 
 futures prices declined 
 a number of developments were <unk> interpreted by traders 
 december delivery gold fell $ N an ounce to $ N 
 december silver eased N cents an ounce to $ N 
 january platinum was down $ N an ounce at $ N 
 one <unk> development was the lower-than-expected increase of only N N in the consumer price index for september an analyst said 
 he noted that the core inflation rate which <unk> food and energy was also low at N N 
 other news that weighed on the market initial unemployment claims rose by N last week american telephone & telegraph co. will reduce its <unk> staff by N through <unk> the oil market turned weaker there was n't any investor demand for bullion and the dollar strengthened during the day putting pressure on gold 
 also the analyst said economic circumstances are such that both south africa and the soviet union the principal gold and platinum producers are being forced to continue selling the metals 
 both are in great need of foreign exchange and south africa is also under pressure to meet foreign loan commitments he said 
 putting it all together we have a negative scenario that does n't look like it will improve overnight he said 
 copper 
 futures prices recovered in quiet trading 
 the december contract rose N cents a pound to $ N 
 that contract fell a total of N cents during the first three days of this week mostly in reaction to last friday 's stock market plunge which prompted concern that it might signal a similar sharp slowing of the u.s. economy and thus reduced demand for copper a leading industrial metal 
 in recent days however there has been increased purchasing of copper in london an analyst said 
 some of this buying was by japan which has had its supplies sharply reduced by long production <unk> at the bougainville mine in <unk> new guinea highland valley mine in british columbia and the cananea mine in mexico which are major shippers to japan 
 the increasing likelihood that cananea and highland valley will soon return to production may have cut some of that purchasing but even if any of these mines begin operating soon their output wo n't be significant until at least the end of the year analysts note 
 so one analyst said even though the long-term production problems may be easing there will still be a significant need for copper over the next three months when inventories will remain relatively low 
 energy 
 crude oil prices ended mixed 
 west texas intermediate for november delivery fell N cents a barrel to $ N 
 but so-called outer month contracts finished higher 
 for instance december contracts for <unk> rose N cents to $ N

 but a flurry of late trading yesterday <unk> up prices 
 heating oil and gasoline futures ended higher as well 
 <unk> belli 's san francisco law offices may have been the epicenter of legal activity after tuesday 's earthquake 
 in the first N minutes after his office 's telephone service was restored yesterday morning N potential clients had called seeking the services of the <unk> king of <unk> 
 mr. belli like many other personal-injury lawyers suspects that the earthquake which measured N on the richter scale will generate enough lawsuits to keep this city 's personal-injury and construction lawyers busy for quite some time 
 suits are likely to be filed against engineering firms contractors and developers as well as against <unk> agencies 
 but lawyers looking to cash in on the quake may have a tough time once their cases reach a judge 
 experts on california <unk> law say <unk> <unk> government agencies in such cases are pretty <unk> 
 even claims against individuals and companies face significant <unk> 
 the major legal barrier is the principle that no one can be held liable for an act of god 
 for now says laurence <unk> <unk> of the <unk> california trial lawyers association the last thing we really need to worry about is whether anybody is going to get sued or whether they have liability or not 
 we still have people <unk> around in a <unk> in san francisco worrying about whether it 's going to rain tonight 
 but that wo n't stop plaintiffs ' lawyers from seeking a little room for <unk> 
 in san francisco they argue an earthquake was a near <unk> 
 therefore engineering firms construction contractors and developers can be sued for not keeping structures up to standard and government agencies can be held <unk> for failing to properly protect citizens from such a foreseeable disaster if negligence can be proven 
 my prediction is there will be mass litigation over errors and <unk> in engineering and contracting says stanley <unk> a well-known cincinnati plaintiffs lawyer 
 from what he saw on television mr. <unk> points out that interstate N which collapsed and killed more than N commuters suffered serious damage while surrounding buildings appeared to sustain no damage <unk> 
 he adds that they were aware of the <unk> for earthquakes and the san andreas fault 
 the flamboyant and <unk> mr. belli says he already has investigators looking into who could be held liable for the damage on the bay bridge and the interstate approaching it 
 we wo n't know until the smoke clears but yes we 're looking into it he says 
 mr. belli says he wants to know whether state or federal engineers or private companies could have prevented the damage 
 mr. belli who was at candlestick park for the world series tuesday night says he has hired civil engineers to check out his own mildly damaged building and to investigate the bridge collapse 
 defense lawyers perhaps <unk> say that plaintiffs ' lawyers taking such an approach will have little success in pursuing their claims though they add that the facts of each case must be looked at <unk> 
 a lot of this is going to be <unk> says <unk> j. <unk> a construction law specialist at <unk> <unk> & <unk> a san francisco law firm 
 plaintiffs he says will argue that damaged structures were n't built to proper design standards 
 but if defendants can prove that they met san francisco 's <unk> building codes that 's probably going to protect them mr. <unk> says 
 government entities continues mr. <unk> could be protected by the california government <unk> liability act 
 under the statute agencies are provided defenses that normally are n't available in the private sector mr. <unk> says 
 the legislature does not want to inhibit the unique government activities by <unk> public entities to liability 
 built into the statute are so-called design <unk> which are likely to protect government agencies according to mr. <unk> and richard covert a lawyer with the california department of transportation which oversees the damaged bay bridge 
 the state is protected when plans and designs for public structures were approved ahead of time or when structures met previously approved standards says mr. covert 
 he believes those defenses might well apply to the bay bridge collapse 
 nevertheless he adds i would n't get totally shocked if we get lawsuits out of the bay bridge 
 if there 's going to be a race to the courthouse it has n't started yet 
 mr. covert had to search through law books scattered on the floor of his office yesterday and mr. belli 's <unk> was <unk> with bricks 
 wednesday mr. belli 's staff was n't permitted into his office by city officials worried about their safety 
 he said he set up shop on the sidewalk in front of his <unk> office and helped victims apply for federal aid free of charge 
 in a news release issued by mr. <unk> the trial lawyers association also promised free assistance to victims 
 the association said it would monitor the conduct of lawyers and warned that solicitation of business is <unk> 
 what 's in a name 
 apparently a lot according to the british firm of deloitte haskins & sells 
 the british firm has begun court proceedings in london to prevent the use of the name deloitte by deloitte haskins & sells and <unk> ross & co. in england and the rest of the world 
 the british deloitte firm recently withdrew from the merger of deloitte and <unk> world-wide and joined coopers & <unk> 
 john bullock senior partner of deloitte in the u.k. said the decision to start these proceedings has n't been taken <unk> 
 mr. bullock said the british firm has used the name deloitte since N 
 in the u.s. deloitte haskins & sells was known as haskins & sells until N when it added the deloitte name of its british affiliate 
 john c. burton an accounting professor at columbia university 's graduate school of business said there 's a lot of <unk> involved in the name of an accounting firm with a long history and with roots in england where accounting <unk> the u.s. 
 although accountants are n't noted as being deeply emotional they really hold it all in said mr. burton former chief <unk> of the securities and exchange commission 
 j. michael cook chairman of deloitte haskins & sells international said he believes the legal action by the british firm to be without merit 
 mr. cook said that last june the international executive <unk> of deloitte and <unk> agreed to a world-wide merger 
 the merger is proceeding according to plan except as to the withdrawal of the deloitte u.k. firm he said 
 partners at other accounting firms say that the deloitte firm in the u.k. is filing the suit to get even with the merged <unk> firm for keeping major <unk> work in england 
 general motors corp. a deloitte audit client for example has agreed to keep its annual $ N million world-wide audit and associated tax work with the merged <unk> firm to be known as deloitte & <unk> in the u.s. 
 in england this would mean that the british deloitte would lose revenue for its audit of gm 's <unk> unit 
 the <unk> of deloitte 's affiliates in britain and the netherlands to coopers & <unk> will make coopers one of the biggest accounting firms in europe <unk> <unk> peat <unk> there 
 although coopers has n't been <unk> by other major accounting firms for a merger it is benefiting greatly from fallout from the <unk> merger 
 in new york harris <unk> general counsel of coopers said coopers was aware of the litigation but he declined further comment 
 he also declined to comment on the name that coopers would use in england if deloitte <unk> won its litigation to keep its name 
 coopers uses the coopers & <unk> name world-wide 
 william bennett the white house <unk> director accused local officials in the washington area of blocking construction of prison facilities to house convicted drug dealers 
 politics has essentially put up a <unk> to finding sites for new federal prisons mr. bennett said at a news conference called to report on his emergency assistance program for the capital 
 without more space to <unk> convicted criminals he added we will not win the war on drugs 
 mr. bennett declared in april that he would make washington a test case for how the bush administration would aid cities <unk> by heavy drug trafficking and violence 
 the drug <unk> claimed that enforcement efforts are working here <unk> at a slower and more <unk> pace than we would like 
 he acknowledged however that washington 's drug-related murder rate is <unk> high 
 the prisons are too crowded 
 drugs continue to be sold openly around schools parks and housing projects 
 mr. bennett declined to name the area officials who he believes have <unk> plans for building more federal prisons to ease washington 's problem 
 but other bush administration officials have criticized maryland gov. william <unk> for blocking the use of possible sites in that state 
 administration officials also have said that washington mayor <unk> barry has delayed consideration of sites in the city 
 in a letter to mr. bennett 's office released yesterday washington 's city administrator carol thompson complained that the drug <unk> had <unk> the amount of federal drug-related assistance provided to the capital 
 referring to mr. bennett 's claim that the federal government would provide $ N million in emergency federal support ms. thompson wrote our analysis was unable to even come close to <unk> that figure 
 of his successes in washington mr. bennett stressed that existing federal prisons have taken custody of N local <unk> 
 he also noted that the federal drug enforcement administration has established a <unk> task force responsible since april for N <unk> and more than $ N million in seizures of drug dealers ' assets 
 the defense department has lent the washington u.s. attorney N prosecutors and the federal bureau of investigation has provided crime laboratory facilities and training he added

 in the wake of the earthquake in california and the devastation of hurricane hugo many companies in <unk> areas are <unk> the question of <unk> 
 some particularly in west coast earthquake zones are <unk> off their evacuation plans checking food stocks and <unk> employees of what to do if emergency strikes 
 others say they feel confident that steps they 've already taken would see them through a disaster 
 <unk> involves more than <unk> and fire <unk> these days 
 some big companies have teams of in-house experts focusing on safety and business <unk> 
 many companies in the path of potential disaster have set up <unk> offices in safe regions hoping they can transport employees there and resume operations quickly 
 that means making sure that copies of vital computer software and company records are out of harm 's way

 although arco 's head office more than N miles from the epicenter was n't affected by this week 's tremors ms. <unk> used the occasion to distribute a <unk> memo of earthquake tips to N arco employees 
 you need to capitalize on these moments when you have everyone 's attention she says 
 it was a good reminder that we all need to prepare prior to an event 
 the arco memo urges employees to keep certain supplies at work such as solid shoes and heavy <unk> to clear debris 
 it also recommends that employees be aware of everyday office items that could be used for emergency care or shelter 
 among the suggestions <unk> and men 's ties could be used for <unk> while <unk> wooden shelves might aid in breaking through office walls 
 arco maintains an office in dallas that would take over if payroll operations in pasadena were disrupted 
 two months ago the company set up a <unk> number based outside california to handle <unk> from employees about when they should report back to work after an earthquake or other disaster 
 the arco plan takes into account such details as which aspects of business are <unk> at certain times of the year 
 this way depending on when a quake might strike priorities can be assigned to departments that should be brought back on line first 
 at hewlett-packard co. the earthquake came just as the company was reviewing its own emergency procedures 
 we were talking about scheduling a practice drill for november says joan tharp a spokeswoman 
 then we had a real one in the afternoon 
 the palo alto calif. computer maker scrambled to set up a special phone line to tell manufacturing and support staff to stay home wednesday 
 sales and service employees were asked to report to work to help bay area clients who called with computer problems 
 hewlett-packard also called in its systems experts to restore its own computer operations 
 that means we can accept orders and begin getting back to normal says ms. tharp

 with the edison plant coming on line next summer the times is facing some tough earnings comparison in the future said peter <unk> an analyst with <unk> lawrence morgan grenfell

 tuesday 's rout of a gop congressional hopeful in a mississippi district that has n't backed a democratic presidential candidate since <unk> stevenson is another reminder that at least at the federal level political ticket splitting has been on the rise over the past half century 
 in only one presidential election year prior to N did more than N N of the nation 's congressional districts choose a different party 's candidate for the white house than for the house of representatives 
 now that percentage routinely <unk> a third and twice has been above N N 
 as we know voters tend to favor republicans more in races for president than in those for congress 
 in every presidential election over the past half century except for the <unk> presidential <unk> the gop has captured a greater percentage of the <unk> popular vote for president than it has of congressional seats or the popular vote for congress 
 prior to N the pattern was nearly the opposite 
 what accounts for the results of recent decades 
 a simple economic theory may provide at least a partial explanation for the split <unk> displayed by americans in the voting <unk> 
 the theory relies on three assumptions 
 N voters can buy one of two brands when they select their political agents a republican brand that believes in the <unk> state and in the <unk> of private markets over the <unk> of public action and a democratic brand that believes in big government and in public intervention to remedy the excesses <unk> to the pursuit of private interest 
 N congressional representatives have two basic responsibilities while voting in office dealing with national issues <unk> actions such as casting roll call votes on legislation that imposes costs <unk> <unk> benefits on the population at large and attending to local issues constituency service and pork barrel 
 N republican congressional representatives because of their belief in a <unk> state are less willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than are democratic members of congress 
 if these assumptions hold voters in races for congress face what in economic theory is called a prisoner 's dilemma and have an incentive at the margin to lean democratic 
 if they put a republican into office not only will they acquire less in terms of local benefits but their selected legislator will be relatively <unk> to prevent other legislators from bringing home the <unk> to their respective <unk> 
 each legislator after all is only one out of N when it comes to national policy making 
 in races for the white house a voter 's incentive at the margin is to lean republican 
 although a gop president may limit local benefits to the voter 's particular <unk> such a president is also likely to be more effective at preventing other <unk> and their legislators from bringing home the local benefits 
 the individual voter 's standing consequently will be enhanced through lower taxes 
 while this theory is <unk> simple it appears to explain several things 
 first why ticket splitting has increased and taken the <unk> pattern that it has over the past half century prior to the election of franklin <unk> as president and the advent of the new deal government occupied a much smaller role in society and the prisoner 's dilemma problem <unk> voters in races for congress was considerably less severe 
 second it explains why voters hold congress in <unk> but generally love their own congressional representatives any individual legislator 's constituents appreciate the specific benefits that the legislator wins for them but not the overall cost associated with every other legislator doing likewise for his own constituency 
 third the theory suggests why legislators who pay too much attention to national policy making relative to local benefit-seeking have lower security in office 
 for example <unk> members of the house once the most vulnerable of <unk> have become virtually immune to defeat 
 the one exception to this recent trend was the defeat of N of the N freshman republicans brought into office in N by the reagan revolution and running for re-election in N 
 because these <unk> placed far more emphasis on their <unk> role spreading the reagan revolution in national policy making they were more vulnerable to defeat 
 fourth the theory indicates why the republican party may have a difficult time attracting viable candidates for congressional office 
 potential candidates may be discouraged from running less by the congressional salary than by the prospect of defeat at the hands of a democratic opponent 
 to the extent that potential republican candidates and their financial backers realize that the congressional prisoner 's dilemma game works to their disadvantage the republican party will be <unk> in its attempts to field a competitive slate of congressional candidates 
 fifth the theory may provide at least a partial reason for why ticket splitting has been particularly <unk> in the south 
 to the extent that democratic legislators from the south have held a disproportionate share of power in congress since N and have been able to translate such clout into relatively more local benefits for their respective <unk> voters in the south have had an especially strong incentive to keep such democrats in office 
 finally the theory suggests why republicans generally have fared better in senate races than in campaigns for the house 
 since local benefit-seeking matters more and national policy making matters less in the lower chamber of congress this is precisely the pattern one would expect if republicans are less willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than their democratic counterparts 
 is there any <unk> support for this theory 
 three pieces of evidence <unk> the key assumption that democratic legislators are more willing to engage in local benefit-seeking than their republican colleagues 
 first economists james bennett and thomas <unk> find that gop senators turn back roughly N N more of their allocated personal staff budgets than democrats do 
 to the extent that the primary duty of personal staff involves local benefit-seeking this indicates that political philosophy leads congressional republicans to pay less attention to narrow <unk> concerns 
 second if the key assumption is valid democrats should have lower attendance rates on <unk> votes than republicans do to the extent that such votes reflect national policy making and that participating in such votes takes away from the time a legislator could otherwise devote to local benefit-seeking 
 this is indeed what the data indicate particularly in the case of the house 
 the democratic house attendance rate has not exceeded the republican house attendance rate since N 
 finally as shown in the table democrats <unk> a higher proportion of their personal staffs to district offices where local benefit-seeking duties matter more and national policy making activities matter less relative to washington offices 
 an examination of changes in personal <unk> decisions in the senate between N and N when control of that body changed party hands moreover reveals that the personal <unk> differences noted in the table can not be attributed to the disproportionate control democrats exercise due to their <unk> status over other resources such as committee staff 
 an additional piece of evidence from the senate holding other factors constant such as <unk> advantages and regional factors the difference between popular votes for republican presidential and <unk> candidates in states conducting a senate election turns out to be a positive function of how onerous the federal government 's tax burden is per state a <unk> tax rate hits <unk> states harder 
 put more simply gop candidates for president are looked on more <unk> by voters than republican candidates for the senate when the prisoner 's dilemma is more severe 
 moreover ticket splitting appears to take the same <unk> pattern at the state government level as it does at the federal level 
 state government is more typically split along <unk> lines than the reverse 
 a <unk> <unk> investigation furthermore reveals that holding other factors constant the difference between a state 's <unk> vote going to the republican gubernatorial candidate and the republican share of the lower state house is a positive function of the state tax rate 
 in sum at both the federal and state government levels at least part of the seemingly <unk> behavior voters display in the voting <unk> may have an <unk> rational explanation 
 mr. <unk> teaches at the university of southern california 's business school 
 a house-senate conference approved a nearly $ N billion state justice and commerce department bill that makes federal <unk> for <unk> held in world war ii <unk> camps a legal <unk> after next oct. N 
 the measure provides no money for the promised payments until then but beginning in fiscal N the government would be committed to meeting annual payments of as much as $ N million until the total liability of approximately $ N billion is paid 
 the action <unk> earlier efforts to find offsetting cuts to fund the payments but is widely seen as a more realistic means of <unk> <unk> first authorized in N 
 the action came as congress sent to president bush a fiscal N bill providing an estimated $ N billion for the departments of labor education health and human services 
 final approval was on a N roll call in the senate which sets the stage for a veto confrontation with mr. bush over the issue of publicly financed abortions for poor women 
 <unk> an <unk> federal policy the measure supports medicaid abortions in cases of rape and incest but mr. bush has so far refused to support any specific exemption beyond <unk> in which the mother 's life is in danger 
 mr. bush 's veto power puts him a commanding position in the narrowly divided house but a vote to override his position could well pick up new support because of the wealth of health and education programs financed in the underlying bill 
 the measure before the conference yesterday funds the departments of state justice and commerce through fiscal N 
 an estimated $ N billion is provided for next year 's census and negotiators stripped a <unk> rider seeking to block the counting of illegal aliens 
 elsewhere in the commerce department nearly $ N million is <unk> for assistance programs under the economic development administration 
 and in a <unk> to the fall of house speaker james wright this year the conference voted to <unk> $ N million in <unk> <unk> funds for a fort worth texas <unk> project that figured in ethics charges against the former democratic leader 
 fiscal pressures also forced the adoption of new fees charged by federal agencies and an N N increase in the securities and exchange commission 's budget would be financed entirely by an added $ N million in filing fees 
 in an unprecedented step the measure anticipates another $ N million in receipts by having the federal bureau of investigation charge for <unk> services in civil cases a change that is almost certain to increase pentagon costs in processing personnel and security <unk> 
 the bill does n't include an estimated $ N billion in supplemental anti-drug funds for justice department and law-enforcement accounts that are still in conference with the house 
 but yesterday 's agreement would make it easier for state governments to handle the promised aid by deferring for one year a scheduled N N increase in the required state matching funds for law-enforcement grants 
 similarly the measure <unk> the current funding formula to promise smaller states such as new hampshire and delaware a minimum allocation of $ N million each in drug grants or three times the current minimum 
 the odd mix of departments in the bill makes it one of the more <unk> of the annual appropriations measures and the <unk> provisions attached by lawmakers run from $ N million for a fish farm in arkansas to a music festival in moscow under the united states information agency 
 lawmakers scrapped all of a $ N million state department request for the N <unk> in <unk> spain but agreed elsewhere to $ N for an oil portrait of former chief justice warren burger 
 senate commerce committee chairman ernest <unk> d. s.c. who also chairs the senate appropriations subcommittee for the department attached $ N million for an advanced technology initiative including work on high-definition television 
 his republican counterpart sen. warren <unk> r. n.h. has used his position to wage a legislative war with the conservative board of the legal services corp 
 an estimated $ N million is provided to maintain the program but mr. <unk> also succeeded in <unk> language seeking to curb the authority of the current board until new members are confirmed 
 the effective date of any new regulations by the current board would be delayed until oct. N next year and the bill seeks to reverse efforts by the corporation to cut off funds to service organizations such as the food research and action center 
 the bill also provides $ N million to meet u.s. contributions to international organizations and $ N million for <unk> activities 
 both accounts reflect significant increases from fiscal N although the amount for <unk> shows a N N cut from the administration 's request 
 mercury savings & loan association said it retained merrill lynch capital markets as its lead investment banker to advise it regarding a possible sale or other combination of the <unk> beach calif. thrift 
 mercury which has assets of more than $ N billion and N branches in california said the action to improve its regulatory capital position is related directly to new capital requirements mandated by recently adopted federal legislation 
 mercury also said it extended its two-year advisory relationship with montgomery securities of san francisco 
 mercury 's stock closed yesterday at $ N unchanged in composite trading on the new york stock exchange 
 watching congress sweat and <unk> through its annual budget <unk> fighting the urge to spend more we 're reminded of those <unk> movies in which the <unk> serial killer turns himself in to police and says stop me before i kill again 
 the members know they 're doing wrong but they need help to restrain their <unk> <unk> 
 arkansas democrat david <unk> <unk> his <unk> on the senate floor the other day after he 'd joined the finance committee 's <unk> pork-barrel <unk> i must tell you 
 i come to the floor tonight as one who ended up with a <unk> of <unk> matter 
 it was nothing more or nothing less than a feeding frenzy 
 he was turning himself in 
 frankly as i was walking back to get in my car i heard many many people opening champagne bottles and celebrating individual victories that some of us had accomplished in getting our little deal in the tax bill and <unk> at this person for slipping this in he said 
 as i was driving home i did not feel very good about myself 
 we can <unk> mr. <unk> 's moment of <unk> even as we understand that he and his <unk> need restraint <unk> they kill again 
 a good place to start the rehabilitation is a legislative line-item veto bill now being offered by indiana senator dan coats 
 the coats bill which already has N senate <unk> is n't a pure line-item veto because it would apply only to spending bills 
 instead it 's a form of enhanced <unk> giving a president a chance to <unk> or strike specific spending items that just go too far 
 under the proposal a president would have a chance twice each year to return a package of <unk> to the hill once when he proposes his budget and again after congress <unk> 
 congress would have N days to reject the package with a N N majority but then a president could veto that rejection 
 congress would then need the usual two-thirds majority to override any veto 
 the proposal would restore some discipline erased from the budget process by the N budget reform act 
 before N a president could <unk> or refuse to spend funds appropriated by congress 
 presidents kennedy and johnson were both big users of the <unk> power but congress saw its chance against a weakened president nixon and stripped it away 
 today a president can still send up spending <unk> but they 're <unk> unless congress has a guilty <unk> and changes its mind 
 this is like asking <unk> to feel <unk> about <unk> and naturally <unk> are almost never approved 
 in N president reagan sent N <unk> back to the hill but only N N of the spending total was approved by congress 
 senator coats 's proposal would let the proposed spending cuts take place automatically unless congress acts 
 the members could still try to serve their constituents with special-interest <unk> but the police in the form of a president would be there with a <unk> if they really get crazy as they do now 
 mr. coats plans to offer his proposal as an amendment to a bill to raise the federal debt limit before the end of the month 
 president bush has endorsed the idea and at least N sitting senators have voted to support enhanced <unk> authority in the past 
 we 're told senator <unk> is n't yet a <unk> but if he and his colleagues are serious about <unk> their <unk> they 'll sign up 
 business and civic operations <unk> back toward <unk> here as congressional officials estimated that the price tag for emergency assistance to <unk> california would total at least $ N billion

 it is likely to get as much as $ N million initially in additional funds and eventually could get more than $ N billion according to mr. fazio a member of the house appropriations committee 
 white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said there is enough money on hand to deal with immediate requirements 
 the bush administration has at its disposal $ N million in funds remaining from the $ N billion congress released for the cleanup after hurricane hugo 
 we feel we have the money necessary to handle the immediate short-term requirements mr. fitzwater said 
 he added that the office of management and budget the transportation department and other agencies are developing longer-term legislation that should be ready soon 
 much of the cost of cleaning up after the earthquake will involve <unk> highways and bridges

 california lawmakers want to eliminate temporarily a $ N million cap on the amount of federal highway relief for each state for each disaster as well as a prohibition on using the emergency highway aid to repair toll roads 
 in addition under the <unk> program the federal government provides N N of emergency highway aid for only the first N days of a repair effort 
 after that the federal share <unk> 
 for interstate highways the federal share normally would drop to N N of the cost of repairs and the state would have to pick up the remainder of the cost 
 but lawmakers want to extend the period for N N federal funding for several months 
 those changes also would apply to two areas hit hard by hurricane hugo south carolina and the u.s. virgin islands according to an aide to rep. fazio

 gerald f. <unk> and joe <unk> in washington contributed to this article 
 is an american secretary of state seriously suggesting that the khmer rouge should help govern cambodia 
 apparently so 
 there are no easy choices in cambodia but we ca n't imagine that it benefits the u.s. to become the catalyst for an <unk> process that could end in another round of <unk> in cambodia 
 now that vietnam appears to have pulled out its <unk> army the state department is talking again about accepting an interim coalition government in the <unk> capital of <unk> <unk> 
 the coalition would include the current <unk> <unk> sen regime the two <unk> resistance groups led by son <unk> and prince <unk> and the khmer rouge 
 the aim would be to end the guerrilla war for control of cambodia by allowing the khmer rouge a small share of power 
 the state department says that any khmer rouge participation would have to be minimal 
 the usual problem with including communists in interim coalition governments is that their <unk> and methods require they squeeze out everyone else 
 recall that nicaragua 's sandinistas came into managua as partners in a coalition government with <unk> <unk> 
 within two years the <unk> were <unk> or in prison nicaragua had gone communist and the sandinistas were building one of the biggest <unk> in latin america and threatening their neighbors 
 in <unk> when the western powers bowed to pressure for such a coalition it turned out they were opening the door to communist domination 
 even <unk> <unk> 's china began in N with a partnership between the communists and a number of smaller <unk> parties 
 what <unk> the scene in cambodia is that the current regime is already communist as are its vietnamese <unk> back in <unk> as are the khmer rouge who are the strongest of the three guerrilla groups 
 it 's not clear which crew of communists might prevail in a coalition government but the one good bet is that the <unk> would disappear 
 that would leave <unk> sen and the khmer rouge 
 the <unk> sen regime has sent thousands of <unk> <unk> to die of <unk> and <unk> while building cambodia 's equivalent of the berlin wall near the <unk> border 
 the khmer rouge however carry an <unk> record for <unk> <unk> 
 these <unk> caused the deaths by <unk> disease or execution of well over one million <unk> 
 the <unk> <unk> was so bad that the vietnamese <unk> in N was a <unk> form of relief 
 the world might want to believe that the khmer rouge ca n't still be such bad guys just as in the late 1970s it was reluctant to credit the reports of <unk> then taking place 
 but there is no solid evidence that the khmer rouge have changed 
 some of our sources in thailand say the notorious old khmer rouge leader <unk> pot has been <unk> up this summer in khmer rouge camps near the <unk> border 
 so it 's difficult to <unk> the notion that mr. baker is willing to accept conditions that would help the khmer rouge set up shop again in <unk> <unk> 
 true prince <unk> backs the idea of such a coalition at least for this week 
 but prince <unk> has backed all sorts of ideas over the years and done rather better by himself than by cambodia 
 nor should the u.s. worry much about <unk> china which still aids the khmer rouge 
 it 's time the state department recognized that china does not play by <unk> 's rules 
 for the u.s. to lend even the <unk> support to the most <unk> <unk> on <unk> 's bleak scene could only <unk> america 's allies elsewhere 
 it would be entirely rational for communist <unk> in countries such as the philippines or peru to conclude the following fight <unk> enough and the u.s. under the <unk> of <unk> might eventually help negotiate your way to victory 
 u.s. <unk> has done it before and it will likely do it again 
 the administration and congress have lately <unk> around the idea of sending military aid to cambodia 's <unk> 
 but now the possibility of diplomatic movement vietnam 's withdrawal the baker initiative has put that plan on hold with the <unk> that if the going got rough the u.s. would then <unk> the opposition 
 why the <unk> 
 at the very least the odds are heavily weighted against the prospects of preventing the khmer rouge and cambodia 's communists from ultimately moving against their opponents 
 when that day comes it would be particularly awful to know that the united states sat on military aid and deprived these people of the means to settle their fate with at least a little honor

 dell computer corp. squeezed by price pressure from its larger competitors and delays in its new product line said its per-share earnings for fiscal N will be half its previous forecasts 
 although the personal computer maker said it expects revenue to meet or exceed previous projections of $ N million for the year ending jan. N N earnings are expected to be N cents to N cents a share down from previous estimates of N cents to N cents

 in the third quarter last year dell had net income of $ N million or N cents a share on sales of $ N million 
 mr. dell attributed the earnings slide to new product delays such as a laptop scheduled for september that wo n't be introduced until early november 
 some delays have been caused by a shortage of <unk> notably intel corp. 's newest chip the N but others apparently have been caused by dell 's explosive growth and <unk> stretched resources 
 they 've got a lot of different balls in the air at the same time observes jim <unk> a computer securities analyst with dallas-based william k. <unk> & co 
 mr. dell meanwhile concedes the company was definitely too optimistic in its expectations 
 product delays however have left dell <unk> by <unk> competition in its bread-and-butter line of desktop computers as powerhouse competitors compaq computer corp. and international business machines corp. price their pcs more aggressively 
 the result has been <unk> margins which have been further eroded by an ambitious research and development effort and rapid overseas expansion

 tuesday 's earthquake will depress local real-estate values in the short term and force companies to reconsider expanding in or <unk> to the bay area and california real-estate and relocation specialists said 
 few specialists said they expect the quake to have much of an effect on most california property values 
 but real-estate experts and brokers said the quake undoubtedly will drag down prices in neighborhoods built on less stable ground especially in the bay area 
 california prices were already coming down 
 this is n't going to help said kenneth t. rosen chairman of the center for real estate and urban economics at the university of california at berkeley 
 state housing prices at a median $ N have declined in recent months because of potential buyers ' inability to afford homes 
 mr. rosen among others suggested that the quake the strongest since the N temblor that struck san francisco will in the short term create a two-tier price system for <unk> communities with <unk> built on <unk> ground likely to demand higher prices

 my gut feeling is that the marina properties will be affected said grace <unk> senior vice president at <unk> & ellis residential brokerage inc 
 neither she nor other real-estate executives and brokers could project how much less marina properties might bring but she said the two-tier price structure would affect prices for a while

 because of the size of the california market few relocation specialists expect a widespread corporate flight in the quake 's aftermath

 h&r block is one of the great success stories of u.s. business 
 oddly enough this presents a problem for the stock 
 some money managers are <unk> with h&r block because they suspect the company 's glory days are past or at least passing 
 block 's <unk> business is mature they say and some of its <unk> are facing tough competition 
 it 's no secret that block dominates the mass-market <unk> business 
 the street knows all about the <unk> of its earnings which are headed for a ninth consecutive yearly increase 
 the company has consistently earned more than a N N annual return on its net worth while many companies would be happy with N N 
 but the <unk> business simply has no more room to grow says mark <unk> director of research for capital supervisors inc. a chicago firm that manages $ N billion 
 you go to any medium-sized town in the u.s. and you 're going to see h&r block tax services 
 mr. <unk> 's firm once held about N N of h&r block

 one thing you can bet on he says is that congress will do stupid things with the tax code

 he figures block earnings are now growing at about a N N annual rate down from about N N the past five years and will grow at an N N rate in the future 
 that 's not bad mr. sit says but it sure does n't justify block shares being priced at N to N times estimated earnings for fiscal N

 to be economically <unk> the N billion canadian dollar us$ N billion project requires almost a doubling of natural gas export prices 
 it also faces numerous other hurdles including an agreement on a pipeline route for the gas 
 the board said the export licenses would be issued on the condition that canadian interests would also be allowed to bid for the mackenzie delta gas on terms similar to those offered to u.s. customers 
 u.s. buyers have already been lined up 
 they include enron corp. texas eastern corp. pacific interstate transmission co. and tennessee gas pipeline co 
 the project could result in the u.s. taking more than N N of its natural gas supplies from canada up from about N N currently 
 it would bring N gas fields into production at a combined rate of about N billion cubic feet a day 
 the board estimated that the cost of building a pipeline from the mackenzie delta to alberta would be about c$ N million

 where do americans put their money 
 it depends on when you look 
 in N for instance less than N N of assets went into bank deposits 
 that rose to nearly N N during the depression and has n't changed much since 
 pension reserves on the other hand made up a relatively small part of household assets until the last decade when they skyrocketed 
 and there has been a drastic decline in the importance of <unk> business assets thanks to industry consolidation and a decline in family farms 
 that 's some of what emerges from the following charts which show how americans have changed their investment patterns over the past N years 
 some results are <unk> 
 but other figures are surprising 
 housing for instance has remained a fairly steady component of household assets over the past decade although common wisdom would have expected an increase 
 there is a lot of attention paid to housing as a form of household wealth says edward n. <unk> professor of economics at new york university 
 but it has n't increased much relative to other assets 
 it suggests that households <unk> wealth across a broad spectrum of assets 
 and housing though it appears in the popular mind as being the major growing household asset is n't 
 in addition investors ' desire to hold stocks directly and through mutual funds has held surprisingly steady stocks ' importance among assets largely reflects the ups and <unk> of the stock market and not a shift in <unk> preferences 
 stocks have not spread to the general public despite the fact that the environment is much different concludes robert avery an economist at cornell university 
 to me it says that despite all the views that we spend too much of our wealth on paper assets we have ways of holding wealth similar to N years ago 
 the charts show how <unk> assets have been distributed over time

 lin which has agreed with bellsouth corp. to merge their <unk> businesses said then that it would n't take a position on mccaw 's revised tender offer

 mccaw is seeking N N of the cellular and broadcasting concern the revised offer includes a feature requiring mccaw to begin an auction process in july N that would buy out remaining holders at a per-share price roughly equivalent to what a third party might then have to pay for all of lin 
 the letter <unk> broad powers for an independent group of directors provided for in the revised offer 
 in a statement craig o. mccaw chairman and chief executive officer of mccaw said we trust lin will take no further actions that favor bellsouth 
 mccaw said the three independent directors provided for in the offer would be designated by the current board 
 the <unk> would be <unk> by the independent directors 
 lin would have a priority right to pursue all opportunities to acquire u.s. cellular interests in markets other than those in which mccaw holds an interest or which are <unk> to those markets unless lin has an interest there or <unk> to it 
 independent directors would have veto rights to any acquisition if they unanimously decide it is n't in lin 's best interest 
 independent directors would be able to block transactions they unanimously <unk> would be likely to depress the private market value of lin at the time it is to be sold in five years 
 if lin is put up for sale rather than purchased by mccaw in five years mccaw wo n't submit a bid unless the independent directors request it and the independent directors will run the bidding 
 the directors would be able to sell particular assets to enable such buyers as the regional bell operating companies to purchase the company 's interests

 the insurance brokerage agency just a <unk> of helmsley 's vast empire would be the first piece of the company to be stripped away since last summer when mr. helmsley 's wife <unk> helmsley was found guilty of tax evasion

 bankamerica corp. reported a N N jump in third-quarter earnings as its <unk> recovery from nearly <unk> losses several years ago continued to be fueled by growth in consumer loans higher interest margins and negligible loan losses 
 for the quarter bankamerica said it earned $ N million or $ N a share compared with $ N million or N cents a share a year earlier 
 bankamerica spokesmen said preliminary reports indicate the company was n't <unk> affected by the tuesday earthquake 
 all but eight of the N branches which had some structural damage reopened yesterday for business 
 automated teller machine operations also were up and operating yesterday a bank spokesman said 
 for the first time in nearly two years bankamerica results failed to improve in consecutive quarters but the decline from the second quarter was attributable to special factors 
 third-quarter profit was N N below the $ N million or $ N a share earned in the N second quarter 
 the company cited higher tax credits in the second quarter totaling $ N million compared with $ N million in the third quarter 
 excluding tax credits profit was N N below the second quarter 
 but that drop was caused entirely by a decline in brazilian interest paid to $ N million from $ N million the second quarter 
 moreover bankamerica continued to build its reserve against troubled foreign loans by boosting its loan-loss provision to $ N million about the same as the previous quarter but well above the $ N million in the year-earlier quarter 
 the provision rate was far above bankamerica 's actual net credit losses of $ N million in the third quarter compared with $ N million in the second period and $ N million a year earlier 
 as a result bankamerica said its reserve against troubled <unk> loans once below N N now amounts to N N of the $ N billion of <unk> debt it <unk> it is owed by those nations 
 that level is about the same as some other big banks but far below the N N and N N reserves of bankers trust new york corp. and j.p. morgan & co. respectively 
 by any measure third-quarter earnings were still robust equivalent to a N N return on assets even excluding tax credits 
 by that key measure of operating efficiency bankamerica turned in a better performance than its <unk> los angeles-based competitor security pacific corp. which posted a N N return in the third quarter 
 but it continued to badly trail its san francisco neighbor wells fargo & co. which reported an extraordinary N N return on assets 
 both returns do n't include any tax credits 
 they bankamerica continue to show good performance said donald k. <unk> an analyst with <unk> <unk> & woods inc. san francisco 
 in composite trading yesterday on the new york stock exchange bankamerica common stock edged up N cents to close at $ N a share 
 shareholder equity improved to N N from N N in the previous quarter 
 the N N net interest margin or the difference between the yield on a bank 's investments and the rate it pays for deposits and other borrowings was still <unk> higher than the N N ratio a year earlier and is among the best in the industry analysts said 
 the high margin partly stems from continued strong growth in <unk> consumer loans which jumped N N to $ N billion from a year earlier and residential mortgages which rose N N to $ N billion 
 bankamerica 's total loans rose N N to $ N billion 
 for the nine months bankamerica profit soared N N to $ N million or $ N a share from $ N million or $ N a share 
 international business machines corp. will announce on tuesday a slew of software products aimed at eliminating some of the major problems involved in <unk> manufacturing operations industry executives said 
 many plant floors currently resemble a tower of <unk> with computers robots and machine tools that generally speak their own language and have trouble talking to each other 
 as a result if a problem develops on a production line it is unlikely some supervisor sitting in front of a personal computer or workstation will know about it or be able to correct it 
 so ibm will be announcing more than N products that will be aimed at letting even the <unk> machine tool talk to the <unk> mainframe or anything in between 
 in an unusual display of openness ibm also will be helping customers tie together operations that include lots of equipment made by ibm 's competitors 
 in addition the executives said ibm will be offering programming tools designed to let anyone working on a factory floor write <unk> software for instance to do statistical analysis that would pinpoint a problem on a manufacturing line 
 in armonk n.y. an ibm spokeswoman confirmed that ibm executives will be announcing some <unk> plans next week but declined to elaborate 
 the industry executives said that as usual with such broad announcements from ibm this one will be part reality and part strategy 
 so it will take many quarters for ibm to roll out all the products that customers need and it will take years for customers to integrate the products into their operations 
 also as usual the products will appeal mostly to heavy users of ibm equipment at least initially 
 still consultants and industry executives said the products could help make manufacturing operations more efficient and provide a boost to the <unk> market a market that yankee group a research firm has said may double to $ N billion by N 
 this is a step in the right direction said martin <unk> a yankee group analyst 
 he added though that a lot of this is intentions 
 we 'll have to wait and see how the plan develops 
 the announcements also should help ibm go on the offensive against digital equipment corp. on the plant floor 
 while ibm has traditionally dominated the market for computers on the business side of manufacturing operations and has done well in the market for design tools digital has dominated computerized manufacturing 
 hewlett-packard co. also has begun to gain share in the whole <unk> arena 
 ibm will face an <unk> climb against digital given digital 's reputation for being better than ibm at <unk> together different manufacturers ' computers 
 in addition hewlett-packard while a much smaller player has made a big commitment to the sorts of industry standards that facilitate those <unk> and could give ibm some problems 
 both can be expected to go after the market aggressively gartner group inc. a research firm estimated the digital gets N N of its revenue from the manufacturing market and hewlett-packard gets N N 
 ibm which gartner group said generates N N of its revenue in this market should be able to take advantage of its loyal following among buyers of equipment 
 that is because many companies will <unk> on certain types of equipment as the various parts of the manufacturing market merge and ibm is the biggest player 
 but much will depend on how quickly ibm can move 
 the whole idea of <unk> manufacturing <unk> seems to be making a comeback after losing a little <unk> over the past couple of years when it became apparent that it was n't a <unk> that would make u.s. plants more efficient and <unk> foreign competition 
 <unk> <unk> a gartner group analyst said <unk> changes may still be required to really take advantage of <unk> 's <unk> someone on the shop floor may not like having someone in an office using a personal computer to look over his shoulder for instance and may be able to prevent that from happening 
 but he said a system such as ibm 's should help significantly 
 in making polyethylene sheets out of plastic chips for instance a chip sometimes does n't <unk> gets caught in the machinery and creates a run in the sheets 
 that can be expensive because the problem may not be noticed for a while and the sheets are typically thrown away 
 but mr. <unk> said that if computers can be integrated into the process they could alert an operator as soon as the problem occurred 
 they could also check through the orders on file to find a customer that was willing to accept a lower grade of polyethylene 
 the computer would let the machine run just until that order was filled eliminating waste 
 this sort of improved link figures to eventually become a significant weapon for some companies 
 companies might be able to tell salespeople daily for instance about idle equipment so they could offer discounts on whatever that equipment produces 
 salespeople also could get a precise reading on when products could be delivered in much the same way that federal express has marketed its ability to tell exactly where a package is in the delivery system 
 ford motor co. 's merkur the company 's first new car franchise in the u.s. since the <unk> was unveiled in N now will share <unk> 's fate 
 ford said yesterday it will halt imports of the merkur scorpio a $ N luxury sedan built by ford of europe in west germany 
 the cars are sold under a separate franchise with its own sign in front of <unk> dealers as opposed to new models such as <unk> or <unk> which are sold under existing ford divisions 
 the move to halt imports announced N years and N months to the day after henry ford ii declared that the <unk> division and its <unk> car would be scrapped <unk> the four-year-old merkur brand in the u.s. market 
 it will continue to be sold in the european market 
 merkur 's death is n't nearly as costly to ford as was the <unk> debacle because merkur was a relatively <unk> project with limited sales goals 
 still merkur 's demise is a setback for ford at a time when the company 's image as the u.s. auto maker with the golden touch is showing signs of strain 
 the no. N auto maker 's new <unk> and mercury <unk> models have n't met sales expectations in the year since they were introduced and ford 's trucks are losing ground to their gm rivals 
 this fall ford introduced only one new product a <unk> version of its <unk> lincoln town car luxury model 
 the demise of merkur <unk> <unk> comes after a september in which N merkur dealers managed to sell only N <unk> 
 total merkur sales for the first nine months dropped N N from a year ago to just N cars 
 merkur is n't the only european luxury brand having problems in the u.s. 
 the japanese assault on the luxury market is rapidly <unk> such european makes as <unk> and saab which at least have clear brand images 
 merkur as an import on domestic car lots suffered from the same sort of image confusion that is <unk> sales of imports at general motors corp. and chrysler corp 
 merkur was originally aimed at <unk> into <unk> dealerships the kind of young affluent buyers who would n't be caught dead in a town car a vehicle so <unk> that ford is staging a press event next month linking the town car 's launch to the <unk> of a new aircraft carrier in norfolk va 
 but the brand had trouble from the start 
 the first merkur the <unk> went on sale in early N 
 the <unk> <unk> <unk> in part because american buyers did n't go for the car 's unusual <unk> rear <unk> 
 in may N ford began importing the scorpio sedan from west germany to sell next to a <unk> <unk> in <unk> 
 ford officials said they expected the two <unk> would sell about N cars a year and in N they reached that goal as sales hit N cars 
 it was <unk> from there however 
 one major factor was the decline of the dollar against the mark which began less than a year after merkur 's N launch 
 as the west german currency rose so did merkur prices 
 the merkur cars also suffered from <unk> quality some dealers say 
 it was like a comedy of errors says martin j. <unk> <unk> a big dealer whose star <unk> operation in <unk> mich. sold more <unk> 's than any other dealership 
 but by the third quarter of N <unk> had a high satisfaction rating in internal ford studies a spokesman said 
 apparently however the improvement came too late 
 last fall ford announced it would <unk> the <unk> in the u.s. at the end of the N model year 
 ford said then it would keep the scorpio 
 this year scorpio sales plummeted and at the current sales pace it would take ford N days to sell off the current scorpio inventory of about N cars

 h.f. ahmanson parent of home savings of america reported third-quarter net of $ N million or N cents a share down from $ N million or N cents a share in the year-earlier period

 georgia-pacific corp. exceeding some analysts ' expectations said third-quarter earnings rose N N to $ N million or $ N a share from $ N million or $ N a share in the year-earlier period 
 sales increased N N to $ N billion from $ N billion 
 per-share earnings were enhanced by the company 's share buy-back program which reduced the average shares outstanding to N million in the quarter from N million in the same quarter of N 
 with strong prices in the company 's two major areas building products as well as pulp and paper analysts had expected a <unk> quarter 
 but the performance exceeded some estimates of around $ N a share 
 fueling the growth among other things were <unk> prices for certain building products

 the house public works and transportation committee approved a bill that would give the transportation department power to block airline leveraged buy-outs despite a clear veto threat from the bush administration 
 the N vote clears the way for consideration on the house floor next week or the week after 
 transportation secretary samuel skinner in a letter to the committee warned that he would urge president bush to veto the legislation if it passed congress 
 the senate commerce committee already has approved similar legislation 
 on monday a letter from mr. skinner 's deputy <unk> <unk> said the administration opposed the legislation in its present form 
 some of the bill 's supporters had taken heart from the fact that the letter was n't signed by mr. skinner and that it did n't contain a veto threat 
 the <unk> administration warnings <unk> some lawmakers especially senior republicans who supported the bill because they thought the transportation department favored it 
 we backed this bill because we thought it would help skinner one republican said and now we 're out there <unk> in the wind 
 a few weeks ago mr. skinner testified before congress that it would be cleaner more efficient if he had authority to block buy-outs in advance 
 but he never took an official position on the bill and has <unk> maintained that he already has enough authority to deal with buy-outs 
 under the committee bill the transportation secretary would have N days and an additional N days if needed to review any proposed purchase of N N or more of a major u.s. airline 's voting stock 
 the secretary would be required to block an acquisition if he concluded that it would so weaken an airline financially that it would hurt safety or reduce the carrier 's ability to compete or if it gave control to a foreign interest 
 although the legislation would apply to any acquisition of a major airline it is aimed at transactions financed by large amounts of debt 
 supporters of the bill are concerned an airline might sacrifice costly safety measures in order to repay debt 
 the panel 's action occurs in a politically charged atmosphere surrounding recent buy-out proposals their apparent collapse and the volatile conditions in the stock market 
 it became apparent in hearings that there ought to be regulation of leveraged buy-outs of some sort rep. james <unk> d. minn. chairman of the house aviation subcommittee said during the panel 's deliberations 
 i do n't believe in the airline business you can be totally <unk> because of the high degree of public interest at stake 
 but mr. skinner disagreed calling the legislation a retreat from the policy of <unk> of the airline industry 
 in his letter to committee chairman glenn anderson d. calif. the secretary also said the bill would be at odds with the administration 's policies <unk> open foreign investment and market allocation of resources 
 currently the transportation department does n't have the authority to block a takeover in advance 
 however if the secretary concludes that a transaction has made a carrier <unk> to operate the department may revoke its certificate <unk> the airline 
 such authority is more than adequate say opponents of the legislation 
 but supporters argue that <unk> an airline is so drastic that the department would hesitate doing it 
 the panel rejected a proposal pushed by amr corp. the parent of american airlines to allow the transportation secretary to block corporate raiders from <unk> proxy fights to oust boards that oppose a leveraged buy-out 
 it also voted down proposals to give the secretary much more discretion on whether to block a buy-out and to require the department to consider the impact of a buy-out on workers 
 london shares rallied to post strong gains after initial fears <unk> that the california earthquake would depress wall street prices 
 tokyo stocks which rebounded strongly tuesday extended their gains yesterday but most other asian and pacific markets closed sharply lower 
 in london the financial times-stock exchange 100-share index jumped N points to close at its intraday high of N 
 the index was under pressure for most of the morning over concerns that the effects of tuesday night 's major earthquake in the san francisco area would undermine the u.s. market

 the financial times 30-share index settled N points higher at N 
 volume was N million shares the <unk> of a hectic week compared with N million tuesday

 <unk> guzman cabrera took over the oil workers union mexico 's most powerful labor organization only last january 
 but even in that short time mr. guzman cabrera has become as controversial in his own way as his <unk> predecessor <unk> <unk> <unk> known as la quina 
 president carlos salinas de <unk> used the army to oust la quina who <unk> for N years over a <unk> empire that made <unk> <unk> <unk> or pemex one of the world 's most inefficient oil companies 
 now mr. guzman cabrera is facing accusations that he 's as much a company man as la quina was a <unk> 
 in recent contract negotiations with pemex management mr. guzman cabrera accepted major concessions that greatly curtail the union 's role in <unk> long a source of millions of dollars in <unk> earnings 
 and with the quiet <unk> of mr. guzman cabrera replacing the <unk> <unk> of la quina government <unk> have been given a free hand to open the petrochemical sector to wider private and foreign investment 
 mr. guzman cabrera 's new order has n't arrived without resistance 
 <unk> between union <unk> still <unk> at pemex installations 
 leftist leader <unk> <unk> publicly questioned mr. guzman cabrera 's moral quality suggesting he is part of a conspiracy to turn over the country 's oil a symbol of mexican <unk> to foreigners 
 the <unk> mr. guzman cabrera takes such criticisms in <unk> 
 this is n't a new kind of union leadership it 's a new mexico 
 we 're no longer afraid of <unk> with private or foreign capital he says 
 pemex which produces N N of government revenue desperately needs new investment 
 since world oil prices collapsed in N the government has <unk> pemex 's <unk> to make payments on mexico 's $ N billion foreign debt 
 little money has been returned to upgrade pemex 's aging facilities 
 while the government <unk> pemex from above the union has <unk> it from below 
 a bloated payroll and pervasive <unk> caused pemex 's operating costs to balloon to N cents of each $ N in sales far above the industry <unk> 
 the declines in investment and efficiency explain in part why mexico has been importing gasoline this year 
 some projections show mexico importing crude by the end of the century barring an overhaul of operations 
 whatever you tried to change whether it was cutting costs or attracting new partners the big obstacle was the old union leadership says oil consultant george baker 
 enter mr. guzman cabrera who has a clear understanding of where union leaders fit in the <unk> regime of president salinas 
 i 'm the <unk> if there is one he says <unk> a <unk> to his office 
 beginning as a <unk> in a refinery mr. guzman cabrera put in more than N years at pemex before being pushed into retirement by la quina after a dispute two years ago 
 though he also long benefited from the system built by la quina mr. guzman cabrera says union <unk> had simply gotten out of hand 
 they are at the base of all of the problems of corruption he says 
 thus in recent contract negotiations mr. guzman cabrera gave up the union 's right to <unk> N N of all of pemex 's outside contracts an enormous source of <unk> 
 the union also <unk> the N N commission it had received on all pemex maintenance contracts 
 the union will keep a N N commission on construction projects 
 the new contract also <unk> the $ N monthly coupon good only at <unk> grocery stores that was part of the salary of every worker from <unk> to chief executive 
 about N technical workers notably <unk> and lawyers were switched to <unk> status 
 also because of its reduced capital budget pemex has phased out about N <unk> construction workers reducing the work force to about N the union leader says 
 mr. guzman cabrera says the union 's <unk> will be offset by a wage and benefit package that amounts to a N N increase in compensation 
 but pemex managers are the ones most <unk> by the contract 
 we are <unk> the instruments of administration says <unk> <unk> a pemex <unk> 
 pemex officials would n't say how much money the new contract would save the company but one previous government estimate pegged savings at around $ N million a year 
 pemex 's customers also are pleased with the company 's new spirit 
 <unk> <unk> a big conglomerate has long depended on pemex petrochemicals to produce plastic <unk> material 
 but when the pemex plant shut down for an annual overhaul it would never give notice to its customers 
 the <unk> would completely disrupt our operations says <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 's finance director

 <unk> the union <unk> previous moves by the government to attract private investment in petrochemicals which mexico has been forced to import in large quantities in recent years 
 in may the government unveiled new foreign investment regulations that create special trusts allowing foreigners long limited to a N N stake in secondary petrochemical companies to own up to N N 
 later the government <unk> several basic petrochemicals as secondary products 
 but pemex 's <unk> with private companies and especially foreign ones is controversial in a country where oil has been a symbol of national sovereignty since foreign oil holdings were <unk> in N 
 they are preparing the workers for what 's coming foreign control wrote <unk> <unk> a leftist leader 
 mr. guzman cabrera and government officials insist that foreigners will be limited to investing in secondary petroleum products

 the move subject to a definitive agreement is part of a trend by <unk> banks that have been buying up credit-card portfolios to expand their business 
 just last month a bank of new york subsidiary agreed to buy the credit-card operation of dreyfus corp. 's dreyfus consumer bank for $ N million a transaction that is expected to be completed by the end of the year 
 first city 's portfolio includes approximately N accounts with about $ N million in loans outstanding

 we think there 's a good prospect that competition is going to get pretty fierce in this market said james e. day a first city vice president 
 we see it becoming a <unk> kind of business 
 the company estimated that the transaction would enhance its book value which stood at $ N a share on sept. N by more than $ N million or about $ N a share 
 the company also said the transaction would bolster after-tax earnings by $ N a share when completed and boost its primary capital ratio to N N from N N 
 first city which recently purchased three small texas banking concerns said it would use the proceeds to pursue additional expansion opportunities in the southwest and elsewhere

 british airways plc said it is seeking improved terms and a sharply lower price in any revised bid for united airlines parent ual corp. following the collapse of a $ N billion $ 300-a-share buy-out bid 
 <unk> stevens british air 's chief financial officer told dow jones professional investor report a price of $ N a share is certainly not too low and indicated his company would like to reduce the size of its $ N million cash investment 
 he added the airline is n't committed to going forward with any new bid and has n't participated in bankers ' efforts to revive the transaction that collapsed 
 we 're in no way committed to a deal going through at all 
 we 're not rushing into anything 
 we do n't want to be party to a second rejection he said adding that coming up with a revised offer could easily take several weeks 
 mr. stevens 's remarks confirming a report in the wall street journal that british air wants to start from <unk> in any new bid for the nation 's second-largest airline helped push ual stock lower for the fourth straight day 
 ual fell $ N a share to $ N on volume of N million shares in composite trading on the new york stock exchange as concern <unk> among takeover stock traders about the length of time it will take to revive the purchase 
 under the original buy-out approved by the ual board sept. N ual 's pilots planned to put up $ N million in cash and make $ N million in annual cost concessions for a N N stake 
 ual management was to pay $ N million for N N and british air was to receive a N N stake 
 the buy-out fell through when citicorp and chase manhattan corp. unexpectedly failed to obtain bank financing 
 since then ual stock has fallen N N in what may rank as the largest collapse of a takeover stock ever 
 the <unk> of mr. stevens 's remarks seemed to indicate that british air will take a more active <unk> role in pursuing any new bid 
 he said he believes ual management was badly advised on the funding of its original transaction 
 mr. stevens said british air has n't received any new buy-out proposals from the labor-management group led by ual chairman stephen wolf and has n't received any indication of when one might be <unk> 
 as far as we 're concerned we 're waiting for the dust to settle he said 
 although british air is waiting to see what the buy-out group comes up with mr. stevens said a revised transaction with less debt leverage is likely to be more attractive to banks 
 he said the original proposal is dead and all aspects of a revised version are up for change in light of the changes in ual 's market price the amount of debt banks are willing to fund and the price british air would be willing to pay 
 mr. stevens said he expects the new price will be considerably lower but declined to specify a figure 
 asked whether a $ <unk> figure circulating in the market yesterday is too low he said it 's certainly not too low 
 he added the original offer was a pretty full price and that british air 's contribution was quite a large chunk for us 
 british air was originally attracted to the chance of obtaining a N N stake in the company but was n't particularly happy with paying $ N million 
 if the new deal had us putting up less money but still having N N that would be a point in our favor he said 
 in any new proposal british air would expect a greater rate of return than the <unk> in the original proposal 
 in the event that the buy-out group <unk> in <unk> its bid the ual board could remain under some pressure to seek another transaction even without any legal obligation to do so 
 roughly one-third of its stock is believed held by takeover stock traders who could vote to oust the board if they become <unk> 
 meanwhile the buy-out group 's task of holding its fragile coalition together in the face of the bid 's collapse and internal opposition from two other employee groups has been further complicated by an apparent <unk> in the ranks of the pilot union itself 
 a pilot representing a group of N pilots hired during united 's N strike filed suit friday in chicago federal court to block the takeover 
 the dissident pilots oppose the plan because it would cause them to lose their seniority 
 ual 's management agreed to reduce the seniority of those pilots in exchange for the support of the united pilot union for the buy-out proposal 
 the N pilots involved in the suit are n't members of the union 
 the airline had allowed them to move ahead of some union members in seniority following the N strike a move the union had contested in a previous lawsuit

 corporate efforts to control health-care costs by requiring <unk> prior to planned <unk> and surgery have n't been sweeping enough to reduce the long-term rate of cost increases according to a study by the institute of medicine 
 in the last decade many corporations have embraced the utilization management cost <unk> strategy as a way to control health-care costs for employees 
 these programs vary widely but often require second opinions on proposed surgery <unk> reviews of <unk> <unk> and reviews of treatment during <unk> or recovery periods 
 between N N and N N of today 's workers are covered by such plans up from N N five years ago 
 although it probably has reduced the level of expenditures for some purchasers utilization management like most other cost <unk> strategies does n't appear to have altered the long-term rate of increase in health-care costs the institute of medicine an affiliate of the national academy of sciences concluded after a two-year study 
 employers who saw a short-term <unk> in benefit expenditures are seeing a return to previous trends 
 while utilization management frequently reduces <unk> costs these savings are often offset by increases in <unk> services and higher administrative costs according to the report by a panel of health-care experts 
 the report suggested that current review programs are too narrow 
 the unnecessary and inappropriate use of the hospital and not the actual need for a particular procedure has been the main focus the panel said 
 as a general rule <unk> programs have not made <unk> <unk> of the <unk> costs of alternative <unk> or sites of care 
 the report said that utilization management should have more of an impact as federal research on the effectiveness of medical <unk> helps lead to medical practice guidelines 
 howard <unk> a panel member and a vice president of aetna life & casualty said that utilization management will also do a better job of containing costs as it spreads to cover medical services delivered outside of hospitals 
 there 's pretty good evidence that utilization management has reduced inappropriate <unk> he said 
 but at the same time spending on physician services and <unk> care have <unk> 
 it 's like <unk> a balloon dr. <unk> said 
 david <unk> of a. foster <unk> & co. said that clients of his consulting firm report that utilization management reduces their hospital care bills by about N N but he agreed that for the health-care system as whole some of these savings are offset by administrative and <unk> care costs 
 jerome <unk> chairman of the panel agrees that administrative costs of utilization management programs can be high 
 you have a whole staff standing ready to evaluate the <unk> of recommended treatment he said 
 dr. <unk> who also is president of new england medical center hospitals in boston noted that the hospitals he runs deal with more than N utilization management firms and that many of them have different procedures and requirements 
 the panel urged greater efforts to reduce the <unk> <unk> and cost of utilization review 
 utilization management needs to better demonstrate that it reduces the <unk> use of resources improves the <unk> of patient care and imposes only reasonable burdens on patients and <unk> the panel concluded

 renault and daf are expected to invest a total of about three billion french francs $ N million in the venture including <unk> N billion for design and development costs 
 in addition the companies will each spend about <unk> N billion on <unk> up their plants 
 mr. <unk> said the joint venture represents considerable savings for both renault and daf since both companies would in any case have had to renew their existing ranges of light goods vehicles 
 by <unk> their resources the two groups have effectively <unk> the design and development costs that would otherwise have been <unk> he said 
 renault officials said the potential european market for light trucks in the <unk> to <unk> range is between N and N vehicles annually and renault and daf are aiming for a combined market share of about N N 
 both renault and daf will have world-wide marketing rights for the new range of vans and light trucks 
 under a separate arrangement british aerospace plc 's <unk> group plc subsidiary will also be able to offer the vehicles through its dealers in the u.k. and renault 's <unk> subsidiary renault vehicles <unk> will have similar rights in france 
 daf is <unk> by british aerospace with a further N N held by the dutch state-owned chemical group <unk> <unk> 
 the van <unk> family of the netherlands holds an additional N N of daf 's capital 
 the federal reserve system is the standard object of suggestions for <unk> and institutional changes for two reasons 
 first its position in the government is <unk> 
 it has an unusual kind of independence from elected officials and still has authority over one of the most powerful of government 's instruments the control of the money supply 
 thus we have a condition that is easily described as <unk> 
 second the responsibilities of the federal reserve as guardian of the currency which means as guardian of the stability of the price level sometimes lead it to take measures that are unpopular 
 as former fed chairman william <unk> martin used to say they would have to take the <unk> bowl away just as the party is getting interesting 
 so the federal reserve is an attractive target for complaint by politicians 
 the fed is easily assigned the blame for <unk> like high interest rates or slow economic growth while the politicians can escape responsibility by pointing to the fed 's independence 
 this leads to proposals for reform of the fed which have the common feature of making the fed more responsive to the administration to the congress and to public opinion without however any assumption of additional responsibility by the politicians 
 these proposals include changing the term of the chairman <unk> the terms of the members eliminating the presidents of the federal reserve banks from the <unk> process putting the secretary of the treasury on the federal reserve board having the fed <unk> by an arm of congress the general accounting office putting the fed 's expenditures in the budget and requiring prompt publication of the fed 's minutes 
 some of these ideas are again under consideration in congress 
 but these proposals do not rest on a view of what the fed 's problem is or if they do they rest on an incorrect view 
 they would not solve the problem they would make it worse 
 the problem is not that the fed is too <unk> to the public interest 
 on the contrary it is too responsive to an incorrect view of the public interest 
 the price level in the u.s. is now about N N times as high as it was N years ago 
 on average something that cost $ N N years ago now costs $ N 
 or a wage that was $ N N years ago would buy only $ N worth of stuff today 
 on two occasions the inflation rate rose to more than N N a year 
 in each case the ending of this <unk> inflation caused a severe recession the two worst of the postwar period 
 the enormous inflation over the past N years was largely due to monetary policy 
 at least it would not have happened without the support of monetary policy that provided for a <unk> increase in the money supply during the same period 
 and that increase in the money supply would not have happened without the consent of the federal reserve 
 the basic problem of monetary policy to which reform of the fed should be addressed is to prevent a <unk> of this experience 
 there were two general reasons for the <unk> monetary policy of the past N years 
 N to some extent the federal reserve shared the popular but incorrect view that <unk> monetary policy could yield a net improvement in employment and output 
 N even where the fed did not share this view it felt the need to accommodate to it 
 despite all the formal provisions for its independence the fed seems constantly to feel that if it uses its independence too freely it will lose it 
 the common proposals for <unk> the fed would only make the situation worse if they had any effect at all 
 putting the secretary of the treasury on the board of governors one of the leading proposals today is an example 
 the secretary is the world 's biggest <unk> of money 
 he has a <unk> constant <unk> for lower interest rates 
 moreover he is a political agent of a political president who naturally gives extraordinary weight to the way the economy will perform before the next election and less to its <unk> health 
 these days the secretary <unk> the further <unk> that he is a member of a club of seven finance ministers who meet occasionally to decide what exchange rates should be which is a diversion from the real business of the federal reserve to stabilize the price level 
 how should a reasonable member of the federal reserve board interpret a congressional decision to put the secretary on the board 
 could he <unk> interpret it as encouragement for the fed to give primary emphasis to stabilizing the price level 
 or would he interpret it as instruction to give more weight to these other objectives that the secretary represents low interest rates <unk> economic expansion and <unk> of exchange rates at internationally managed levels 
 the answer seems perfectly clear 
 true a succession of fed chairmen has given color to the notion that the secretary of the treasury belongs on the fed 
 by their constant <unk> to advise all and <unk> about federal budgetary matters the chairmen have encouraged the belief that fiscal policy and monetary policy are <unk> of a common <unk> in which case it is natural that the fed and the treasury and probably also the congress should be jointly engaged in <unk> the pot 
 the fed 's case for its own independence would be a little stronger if it were more <unk> of the independence of the rest of the government 
 the fed 's problem is not that it is too independent or too <unk> 
 the fed is responsive to and can not help being responsive to the more <unk> political part of the government 
 the fed exercises a power given to it by congress and the president 
 but congress and the president accept no responsibility for the exercise of the power they have given the fed 
 critics of the present arrangement are correct to say that it is <unk> 
 what is <unk> is the <unk> of the more political parts of the government to take the responsibility for deciding the basic question of monetary policy which is what priority should be given to stabilizing the price level 
 to leave this decision to an independent agency is not only <unk> 
 it also prevents the conduct of a policy that has a long-term rationale because it leaves the fed <unk> about what are the expectations of its masters the politicians who have never had to consider the long-term consequences of monetary policy 
 the greatest contribution congress could make at this time would be to declare that stabilizing the price level is the primary responsibility of the federal reserve system 
 legislation to this effect has been introduced in congress in this session by rep. stephen neal d. n.c 
 it is not the kind of thing that is likely to be enacted however 
 congress would be required to make a hard decision and congress would much prefer to leave the hard decision to the fed and retain its rights of complaint after the fact 
 people will say that the nation and the government have other objectives in addition to stabilizing the price level which is true 
 but that is not the same as saying that the federal reserve has other objectives 
 the government has other agencies and instruments for pursuing these other objectives 
 but it has only the fed to pursue <unk> stability 
 and the fed has at most very limited ability to contribute to the achievement of other objectives by means other than by stabilizing the price level 
 the two objectives most commonly thought to be legitimate competitors for the attention of the fed are high employment and rapid real growth 
 but the main lesson of economic policy in the past N years is that if the fed <unk> with the <unk> objective in the pursuit of these other goals the result is not high employment and rapid growth but is inflation

 republic new york corp. joined the list of banks boosting reserves for losses on loans to less-developed countries setting out a $ N million provision and posting a $ N million third-quarter net loss as a result 
 the per-share loss was $ N 
 in the year earlier period the new york parent of republic national bank had net income of $ N million or $ N a share 
 excluding the provision republic earned $ N million up N N from a year ago 
 the bank 's <unk> and long-term loans to less-developed countries total $ N million of which $ N million are n't <unk> interest the bank said 
 republic 's total of nonperforming assets was $ N million at sept. N with its reserve for loan losses now standing at $ N million 
 abortion-rights advocates won last week 's <unk> but the war over the nation 's <unk> social question is about to pick up again on turf that favors those seeking to restrict abortions 
 strict new regulations seem certain to pass the state house in pennsylvania next week with easy approval by the senate and by democratic gov. bob <unk> expected shortly thereafter 
 legislation to require the consent of parents before their daughters under the age of N can have abortions will probably pass both houses of the michigan legislature and set up a <unk> battle to override the expected veto of democratic gov. james <unk> 
 the short-term shift in the political climate surrounding abortion reflects two factors that are likely to govern the debate in the next several months the <unk> of the abortion-rights movement as a potent force after years of <unk> and the ability of each side to counter the other 's advance in one arena with a victory of its own elsewhere 
 the action in pennsylvania for example will follow last week 's collapse of a special session of the florida legislature to enact restrictions on abortions in that state and the vote here in washington by the house to permit federally paid abortions for poor women who are victims of rape or incest 
 but president bush is expected to veto the congressional legislation and that along with the easy approval of the pennsylvania measure is likely to <unk> the abortion-rights activists ' claims of momentum and <unk> the challenges faced by this <unk> movement 
 it 's great to feel good for once in N years says harrison <unk> a consultant to abortion-rights advocates reflecting the relief of his <unk> after last week 's victories the first major events since the supreme court in its july N webster decision permitted the states to enact restrictions on abortions 
 but how many more times we 're going to feel good in the next N is another question 
 indeed abortion-rights activists still face their greatest tests 
 the pro-choice movement has shown finally that it can <unk> says <unk> <unk> a <unk> university political scientist who specializes in how state legislators handle the abortion question 
 but it still has n't shown that it can win in a state like pennsylvania or missouri where abortion has been clearly an electoral issue and where it 's been an emotional issue for a long time 
 the foes of abortion hold the strong whip hand in pennsylvania where abortion-rights activists are so much on the defensive that their strategy is less to fight the proposed legislation than it is to stress how the state legislature does n't reflect the <unk> of the state 's citizens 
 as a result gop state rep. stephen <unk> of delaware county the legislature 's leading <unk> of abortion has been given all but free rein to press a strict <unk> plan to restrict abortion and he hopes to force the supreme court directly to <unk> its N roe v. wade decision that established the right of abortion in the first place 
 the <unk> legislation the state 's house judiciary committee approved it in <unk> this week and the full pennsylvania house is expected to take up the bill next tuesday includes a provision to ban abortions after N weeks of pregnancy except to <unk> the death of the mother 
 mr. <unk> <unk> that the provision which attacks the <unk> standards that roe established will make it necessary for the supreme court to review roe and perhaps to <unk> it 
 but the pennsylvania measure also includes an informed consent provision that may become widely <unk> by abortion foes who want to make women contemplating abortion as uncomfortable as possible with the procedure and with themselves 
 under this legislation a woman must be informed N hours before the operation of the details of the procedure and its risks 
 regardless of whether one supports or opposes the right to an abortion mr. <unk> argues it is virtually impossible for any rational human being to disagree with the concept that a woman has the right to have all of the appropriate materials and advice made available to her before she makes a decision which one way or the other might remain with her for the rest of her life 
 in michigan where the state senate is expected to approve <unk> legislation by the end of next week gov. <unk> is the principal obstacle for anti-abortionists 
 susan <unk> a consultant to abortion-rights activists in the state takes comfort from the fact that the state 's house abortion opponents have n't been able to <unk> the votes to <unk> a veto on abortion in N years 
 but proponents believe they may be able to shake enough votes loose to override the veto if they are successful in portraying the legislation as a matter of parents ' rights 
 in illinois lawmakers will vote before next spring on legislation requiring physicians to perform tests on <unk> at N weeks to determine their <unk> age weight and lung maturity along with a provision requiring that if <unk> survive an abortion a second doctor must be on hand to help it survive

 <unk> <unk> executive director of the illinois planned <unk> council says she and her allies are cautiously optimistic they can defeat it if it comes to a floor vote 
 abortion foes in wisconsin meanwhile expect a <unk> bill to be sent to the state assembly floor by early november and are hopeful of prevailing in both houses by next march 
 in texas abortion opponents want to pass <unk> legislation along with a statewide ban on the use of public funds personnel and facilities for abortion and viability tests for <unk> N weeks and older 
 the anti-abortionists are urging gop gov. bill <unk> to press the issues in a special session scheduled to run nov. N to dec. N 
 the <unk> is only fair says <unk> roberts administrative director of the texas right to life committee 
 next year is an election year and the legislators just do n't want to do anything about this now 
 this legislative activity comes as both sides are undertaking new <unk> efforts plunging into gubernatorial races in virginia and new jersey and <unk> for next autumn 's state elections 
 at the same time abortion foes have developed a national legislative strategy deciding to move on what <unk> <unk> the national right to life committee 's director of state <unk> development calls reasonable measures that an overwhelming mainstream majority of americans support 
 these include bans on the use of abortion for birth control and sex selection and the public funding of alternatives for abortion 
 those who are on the other side can hardly oppose alternative funding if they continue to insist on calling themselves pro-choice rather than <unk> says mary <unk> the group 's associate state legislative coordinator 
 over the weekend the national abortion rights action league singled out eight politicians including pennsylvania 's mr. <unk> as N targets and held a washington <unk> designed to train its leaders in political techniques including how to put the anti-abortionists on the defensive in state legislatures

 the large increase in customs service <unk> funds is also intended to counter <unk> and the annual appropriations level has more than <unk> in five years 
 the $ N million provided for fiscal N anticipates the purchase of a lockheed <unk> <unk> aircraft and five <unk> <unk> ii jets 
 despite administration reservations the plan has had the quiet backing of customs officials as well as influential lawmakers from <unk> 's home state kansas 
 among legislative provisions attached to the bill is a ban on any treasury department expenditure for enforcement of a N tax provision intended to counter discrimination in <unk> plans 
 small-business interests have lobbied against the so-called section N tax rules

 b.a.t industries plc may delay aspects of its defensive restructuring plan including the sale of its saks fifth avenue and marshall field units in the wake of the current upheaval in financial markets company officials said 
 the british conglomerate planning its own defensive restructuring to fight off a # N billion $ N billion takeover bid by <unk> financier sir james goldsmith intends to press ahead with an extraordinary shareholder vote today to clear the way for its <unk> measures 
 if anything the gyrations in world stock markets and in b.a.t 's share price since last friday 's sharp wall street sell-off have increased the likelihood of shareholder approval for the restructuring analysts and several big institutional holders said 
 <unk> god we have some deal on the table said stewart <unk> a director at scottish amicable investment managers which intends to vote its roughly N N stake in favor of the restructuring 
 investors in b.a.t have been on a roller <unk> 
 b.a.t has been london 's <unk> blue chip over the past six months up N N against a N N rise in the financial times 100-share index 
 but this week b.a.t has been hit harder than other big u.k. stocks first by the market gyrations then by tuesday 's san francisco earthquake which could leave b.a.t 's farmers group inc. insurance unit facing big claims 
 b.a.t rose five pence eight cents to N pence $ N in london yesterday as a late market rally erased a <unk> fall earlier in the day 
 to fight off <unk> b.a.t plans to spin off about $ N billion in assets largely by selling such u.s. retailing units as marshall field and saks and by floating its big paper and u.k. retailing business via share issues to existing holders 
 proceeds will help pay for a planned buy-back of N N of its shares and a N N dividend increase 
 i think the restructuring will get the required support said michael <unk> an analyst at london <unk> <unk> phillips & drew 
 the shareholders effectively will support the share price by clearing the share buy-back 
 but b.a.t 's restructuring which was never going to happen quickly now will take longer because of the market upheaval 
 company officials holders and analysts who previously expected the <unk> to be substantially complete by the end of next year 's first half now say the market gyrations could delay the actions well into the second half 
 we are n't forced sellers 
 we do n't have an <unk> deadline and if market conditions are truly awful we might decide it is not the right time to take particular steps said michael <unk> a b.a.t spokesman 
 even if b.a.t receives approval for the restructuring the company will remain in play say shareholders and analysts though the situation may <unk> over the next N months rather than six 
 the new b.a.t will be a smaller tobacco and financial-services hybrid whose price-earnings ratio may more closely reflect the <unk> tobacco business than the <unk> financial-services business these holders believe 
 thus b.a.t 's restructuring may only make the company a more <unk> target for other corporate <unk> possibly such <unk> bidders as hanson plc 
 the last few days will surely slow down the pace of events says scottish amicable 's mr. <unk> 
 but i would n't write off sir james or other potential bidders 
 among possible delays the sales of saks and marshall field which were expected to be on the block soon after the crucial christmas season may slide into the second quarter or second half 
 analysts estimate that sales of the two businesses could raise roughly $ N billion 
 b.a.t is n't predicting a <unk> because the units are quality businesses and we are encouraged by the <unk> of inquiries said mr. <unk> 
 but the delay could happen if b.a.t does n't get adequate bids he said 
 people familiar with b.a.t say possible <unk> for the units include managers from both retailing chains and general <unk> corp. which is interested in bidding for saks 
 other potential bidders for parts of b.a.t 's u.s. retail unit include <unk> department stores inc. may department stores co. and limited inc 
 b.a.t has declined to identify the potential bidders 
 though sir james has said he intends to mount a new bid for b.a.t once approval from u.s. insurance regulators is received jitters over prospects for junk-bond financing and u.s. leverage buy-outs are making investors more skeptical about sir james 's prospects 
 his initial offer indicated he needed to raise as much as N N of the takeover financing through the debt markets 
 market uncertainty also clouds the outlook for b.a.t 's attracting a premium price for its u.s. retailing properties 
 finally tuesday 's california earthquake initially knocked N N off b.a.t 's share price in london yesterday because of fears of the potential claims to los angeles-based farmers which has a substantial portion of its property and casualty exposure in california

 he added b.a.t has no expectation of a material impact on farmers

 tom <unk> executive vice president and general manager of the california trucking association in <unk> said his organization urged trucking firms to halt all deliveries into the bay area yesterday except for <unk> supplies 
 some <unk> shipments will probably resume thursday he said 
 right now most of the roads into the bay area are closed but the list of closings changes about every N minutes 
 this wednesday morning the san mateo bridge was open and now we are informed that it is closed mr. <unk> said 
 united parcel service greenwich conn. said its operations in the san francisco area have been reduced to N N of normal 
 a ups spokesman said that although none of the company 's terminals trucks or airplanes were damaged in the quake road <unk> and power failures have <unk> its pickup and delivery of packages 
 the spokesman noted <unk> to <unk> traffic delays on the san mateo bridge for example 
 in addition power failures prevented its <unk> facilities from operating causing delays

 we had no serious damage on the railroad said a southern pacific spokesman 
 we have no problem to our freight service at all expect for the fact businesses are shut down 
 <unk> said it suspended train service into its oakland station which sustained heavy structural damage during the quake 
 the passenger railroad said it terminated some runs in sacramento relying on buses to ferry passengers to the bay area 
 <unk> said it planned to resume some train operations to oakland late yesterday 
 <unk> operations suffered little damage according to albert engelken deputy executive director of the american public transit association in washington

 the highway system is <unk> up by the earthquake mr. engelken said 
 the transit system is how people are going to be getting around 
 he added that san francisco 's <unk> cars and <unk> buses were also running at full service levels 
 although <unk> delays in san francisco were significant yesterday they did n't appear to spread to other airports 
 the earthquake shattered windows at san francisco international 's <unk> control tower and <unk> pieces of the ceiling down on controllers three of whom suffered minor injuries 
 terminals at san francisco international also were damaged but the tower itself was intact 
 tuesday night thousands were diverted to other airports and had to wait a day to resume travel 
 <unk> at san francisco were n't damaged but traffic was being limited yesterday to N <unk> and N departures an hour down from N to N an hour normally mainly because the noise level in the control tower was overwhelming without the windows an faa spokeswoman said

 whitbread & co. put its spirits division up for sale triggering a scramble among global groups for the british company 's brands 
 whitbread already has been approached by about half a dozen companies interested in buying all or part of the spirits business a spokesman said 
 analysts expect the spirits operations and some california <unk> that also are being sold to fetch about # N million $ N million 
 among the brands for sale are beefeater gin the no. N imported gin in the u.s. and <unk> <unk> whiskey 
 also for sale are <unk> <unk> co. which distributes <unk> <unk> <unk> whiskey in the u.s. and whitbread 's atlas peak <unk> in california 's <unk> valley 
 beefeater alone is worth as much as # N million analysts said 
 whitbread bought the beefeater <unk> two years ago for # N million 
 that purchase represented an attempt by whitbread a venerable british brewer to become a major player in the global liquor business 
 but whitbread has been squeezed by giant rivals amid widespread consolidation in the industry 
 now it wants to concentrate on beer and its newer hotel and restaurant operations 
 for rival liquor companies the whitbread auction is a rare opportunity to acquire valuable brands 
 it 's not very often something like this comes up said ron <unk> a liquor company analyst at nomura research institute in london 
 the division will be sold off quite rapidly predicted <unk> <unk> an analyst at london brokers county natwest <unk> 
 among possible buyers grand metropolitan plc might find beefeater a useful addition to its portfolio 
 grand met owns <unk> gin the no. N imported gin in the u.s. rival guinness plc has the no. N imported brand <unk> 
 the whitbread spirits auction is an extremely interesting development and naturally we 'll be considering it carefully a grand met spokesman said 
 guinness which owns several leading whiskey brands plus gordon 's gin the world 's no. N gin is considered less likely to bid for the whitbread spirits 
 a guinness spokesman declined to comment 
 two other global liquor giants canada 's seagram co. and britain 's <unk> plc also are possible buyers 
 seagram 's gin is the world 's no. N gin brand but the company does n't own any of the major gin brands imported in the u.s. 
 <unk> while powerful in whiskey does n't own any major <unk> brands 
 we will certainly have to take a look at the whitbread spirits business an <unk> spokesman said 
 we would certainly like to have a major <unk> brand in our portfolio 
 a seagram spokesman in new york would n't comment 
 smaller liquor companies such as brown-forman corp. and american brands inc. of the u.s. also are likely to be interested 
 such companies are increasingly being left behind in the global liquor business says nomura 's mr. <unk> 
 in new york a spokesman for american brands would n't comment 
 brown-forman a louisville ky. <unk> also declined to comment 
 whitbread 's wine spirits and soft-drink operations had trading profit of # N million on sales of # N million in the year ended feb. N

 but analysts estimate their trading profit at # N million 
 whitbread had total pretax profit in the year ended feb. N of # N million on sales of # N billion 
 whitbread 's spirits auction occurs amid a parallel <unk> in the british beer industry 
 earlier this year the government announced plans to foster increased competition in the industry 
 british <unk> currently own thousands of <unk> which in turn sell only the <unk> ' beer and soft drinks 
 under new rules many of the country 's <unk> would become free houses selling beers of their choice 
 whitbread now intends to bolster its brewing interests in an effort to grab a share of sales to free houses 
 the company which last month paid # N million for regional british brewer <unk> group plc has about N N of the british beer market 
 whitbread also owns the license to <unk> and distribute <unk> and <unk> <unk> beers in britain 
 in addition whitbread intends to focus on its newer hotel liquor store and restaurant businesses in europe and north america 
 in britain those interests include the beefeater <unk> chain and joint ownership with pepsico inc. of the country 's pizza hut chain 
 in canada and the u.s. whitbread owns the <unk> chain of <unk> and <unk> restaurants 
 focusing on beer restaurants and hotels means we can concentrate our skills and resources more effectively peter <unk> whitbread 's managing director said in a statement 
 the spirits business would require substantial additional investment to enable it to compete effectively in the first division of global players 
 whitbread also announced that mr. <unk> who is N will become the company 's chief executive march N

 digital equipment corp. is planning a big <unk> party on tuesday for its first line of mainframe computers 
 but an <unk> guest is expected to try to crash the party 
 on the morning of the <unk> announcement international business machines corp. is to introduce its own new mainframe 
 their attitude is you want to talk mainframes we 'll talk mainframes says one computer industry executive 
 they 're deliberately trying to steal our <unk> a digital executive complains 
 maybe we should take it as a <unk> 
 digital 's target is the $ N billion market for mainframe computers the <unk> <unk> that nearly every big company needs to run its business 
 ibm based in armonk n.y. has dominated the market for decades 
 that does n't scare digital which has grown to be the world 's second-largest computer maker by <unk> customers of ibm 's <unk> machines 
 digital based in maynard mass. hopes to stage a repeat performance in mainframes and it has spent almost $ N billion developing the new technology 
 a <unk> <unk> tandem computers inc. in cupertino calif. jumped into the fray earlier this week with an aggressively priced entry 
 ibm appears more worried about digital which has a broad base of customers waiting for the new line dubbed the vax N 
 it 's going to be nuclear war says thomas <unk> a consultant with <unk> group inc 
 the surge in competition is expected to stir new life into the huge mainframe market where growth has slowed to single <unk> in recent years 
 ibm 's traditional mainframe rivals including unisys corp. control data corp. and ncr corp. have struggled recently 
 digital is promising a new approach 
 robert m. <unk> digital 's vice president for high performance systems says digital 's mainframe is designed not as a central computer around which everything <unk> but as part of a <unk> network <unk> together hundreds of workstations personal computers printers and other devices 
 and unlike ibm 's <unk> mainframes it does n't need any plumbing 
 the <unk> will have a big price advantage 
 digital is expected to tag its new line from about $ N million to $ N million and up depending on <unk> 
 that 's about half the price of <unk> equipped ibm mainframes 
 tandem 's pricing is just as aggressive 
 the heightened competition will hit ibm at a difficult time 
 the computer giant 's current mainframe line which has sold well and has huge profit margins is starting to show its age 
 the new <unk> due next week will boost performance by only about N N to N N 
 and ibm is n't expected to deliver a new generation of mainframes until N 
 still no one expects ibm 's rivals to deliver a <unk> 
 ibm has a <unk> on mainframes with an estimated N N share of the market 
 ibm is five times the size of digital and N times the size of tandem and <unk> enormous market power 
 it counts among its customers a majority of the world 's largest corporations which <unk> their most critical business information to ibm computers 
 we 're not going to walk in and replace a company 's corporate accounting system if it 's already running on an ibm mainframe concedes kenneth h. <unk> digital 's president 
 he says digital will target <unk> market segments such as <unk> transaction processing which includes <unk> tracking airline reservations and <unk> networks 
 tandem which already specializes in <unk> transaction processing is a potent competitor in that market 
 a key marketing target for digital will be the large number of big customers who already own both digital and ibm systems 
 one such company is bankers trust co 
 stanley rose a vice president technological and strategic planning at bankers trust says that despite digital 's low prices we are n't about to <unk> our ibm mainframes for a dec machine 
 the software conversion costs would <unk> any savings 
 but mr. rose is still looking seriously at the N 
 bankers trust uses digital 's vax to run its huge <unk> and capital markets accounts <unk> hundreds of billions of dollars each day he says 
 as that system grows larger computers may be needed 
 in the past customers had to go to ibm when they <unk> the vax 
 now they do n't have to he says 
 that 's going to cost ibm revenue 
 analysts say digital can expect this <unk> demand for the new vax to fuel strong sales next year 
 barry f. <unk> an analyst at sanford c. bernstein & co. estimates the N could boost sales by more than $ N billion in the fiscal year beginning in july 
 he bases the estimate on a survey of hundreds of digital 's largest customers 
 although digital will announce a full family of mainframes next week it is n't expected to begin shipping in volume until next year 
 the first model available will be the N which is likely to appeal to many technical and scientific buyers interested in the <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> says terry shannon of international data corp. a market research concern 
 four more models aimed <unk> at ibm 's commercial customers are expected to begin shipping in late june 
 most analysts do n't expect the new mainframes to begin contributing significantly to revenue before the fiscal first quarter which begins next july N 
 digital 's new line has been a long time coming 
 the company has long struggled to deliver a strong <unk> product and made a costly decision in N to halt development of an interim product meant to stem the revenue losses at the high end 
 digital 's failure to deliver a true <unk> machine before now may have cost the company as much as $ N billion in revenue in fiscal N mr. <unk> says 
 ibm will face still more competition in coming months 
 <unk> corp. backed by japan 's fujitsu ltd. has a growing share of the market with its <unk> <unk> machines

 bond prices rallied early yesterday morning as traders scrambled to buy treasury issues on fears that the northern california earthquake might lead to a stock-market debacle 
 but when stocks held steady treasury bonds later retreated 
 speculation that the federal reserve will lower interest rates in coming weeks helped push the dollar down while boosting stocks traders said 
 but many investors remain wary about stocks partly because they expect continued turbulence in the junk-bond market that would make it more difficult to finance corporate takeovers 
 i 'm surprised we did n't see more volatility in stocks said raymond f. devoe jr. market strategist at legg mason wood walker 
 i think the problems in the junk-bond area are just beginning and this will be very <unk> for companies that have issued junk bonds 
 in a bull market credit does not matter mr. devoe added 
 but when it does matter then it 's the only thing that matters 
 however many institutional investors are reacting to the stock market 's plunge as a great buying opportunity said charles i. <unk> chief investment strategist at merrill lynch capital markets 
 things are beginning to settle down 
 the markets are returning to <unk> 
 oil prices initially rose on fears that the massive earthquake in northern california would disrupt production

 amr corp. posted an N N drop in third-quarter net income and said the fourth quarter will be disappointing as well primarily because of <unk> profit margins and increased fuel costs 
 amr 's earnings decline comes a year after the parent company of american airlines and the rest of the airline industry set profit records 
 some analysts say the latest results only seem pale by comparison with a spectacular second half of N 
 still amr 's <unk> does n't <unk> well for the rest of the industry 
 the fort worth texas company is generally regarded as one of the <unk> in the business and its difficulties are likely to be reflected industrywide as other major carriers report third-quarter results over the next several days 
 meanwhile the company 's board which had said nothing publicly about investor donald trump 's recently withdrawn $ N billion offer for amr issued a statement <unk> <unk> and reckless bids and saying it was pleased that mr. trump had backed out 
 in the third quarter amr said net fell to $ N million or $ N a share from $ N million or $ N a share 
 revenue rose N N to $ N billion from $ N billion a year earlier 
 amr 's chairman robert l. crandall said the results were due to an N N year-to-year increase in fuel prices and a slight decrease in yield an industry measure <unk> to profit margin on each seat sold 
 we think these trends will continue and will produce a very disappointing fourth quarter as well he said 
 tim <unk> an analyst with merrill lynch & co. said the business turned faster than expected 
 costs are giving them a little bit of trouble and the whole industry is having a pricing problem 
 for the nine months amr 's net rose N N to $ N million or $ N a share from $ N million or $ N a share 
 revenue jumped N N to $ N billion from $ N billion 
 amr 's board in a statement after a regular meeting yesterday said <unk> and reckless acquisition proposals <unk> affect employee financial and business relationships and are contrary to the best interests of amr shareholders 
 amr has not been and is not for sale 
 mr. crandall said the company 's current decline in earnings is exactly the kind of situation that an <unk> leveraged company <unk> with debt from a takeover would find difficult to weather

 the government said N N of americans or N million people were living in poverty in N 
 while last year 's figure was down from N N in N and marked the fifth consecutive annual decline in the poverty rate the census bureau said the N drop was n't <unk> significant 
 the bureau 's report also showed that while some measures of the nation 's economic <unk> improved modestly in N the <unk> of prosperity were shared less <unk> than the year before 
 <unk> data derived from a march N survey of N households william <unk> associate director of the census bureau said that most groups either stayed the same or improved 
 but he added since the late 1960s the distribution of income has been slowly getting less equal 
 there was no reversal of that trend between N and N 
 per capita income a widely used measure of a nation 's economic health hit a record in N rising N N after inflation adjustment to $ N 
 but the median income of american families fell N N the first time it has failed to rise since N 
 mr. <unk> said the divergence in the two measures reflects changes in family size and structure including the rising number of <unk> families and a sharp increase in income reported by americans who are n't living in families 
 as a result of last year 's decline the government 's estimate for the number of people living below the poverty line declined by about N 
 the poverty <unk> defined as three times food expenses as calculated by the agricultural department last year was $ N for a family of four 
 the census bureau counts all cash income in determining whether families are below the line but it does n't consider other government benefits such as medicare 
 thanks largely to the continued growth of the u.s. economy the poverty rate is now substantially lower than the N peak of N N but the improvements have been modest in the past couple of years 
 poverty remains far more widespread among blacks than other americans 
 in N N N of blacks lived in poverty compared with N N for whites and N N for hispanics 
 but two-thirds of all poor americans were white 
 more than half of poor families were headed by women living without men the bureau said 
 more than <unk> of poor black families were headed by women 
 the poverty rate of children under N years old dropped last year to N N from N N in N but remained far higher than a decade ago 
 the rate among the elderly N N in N was n't significantly lower than the year before 
 if it were n't for social security payments more than three times as many elderly would be below the poverty line mr. <unk> said 
 the census bureau also said 
 some N N of all money income received by families in N went to the <unk> N N of all families up from N N in N 
 that is the greatest share reported for any year since N although changing <unk> over the years <unk> the comparison 
 the top fifth of all families got N N of the income up from N N a decade earlier 
 the bottom fifth of all families got N N of the income down from N N a decade earlier 
 confirming other government data showing that wages are n't keeping pace with inflation earnings of <unk> full-time male workers fell N N in N after adjusting for higher prices the first such drop since N 
 earnings of female workers were unchanged 
 women working full-time earned N cents for every dollar earned by men a penny more than in N and seven cents more than in N 
 median household income which includes both those living in families and those who are n't rose N N last year to $ N after inflation 
 it rose sharply in the northeast and midwest and fell slightly in the south and west 
 median family income was $ N down N N 
 per capita income of blacks though still only N N that of whites rose N N in N while per capita income of whites rose only N N 
 among married couples the gap between blacks and whites narrowed sharply as income of black families shot up N N while income of whites did n't <unk> 
 fueling a controversy that has been <unk> for years the census bureau also said its figures would look far <unk> if it <unk> the poverty <unk> using an improved <unk> measure adopted in N 
 the bureau said some N million fewer people would have fallen below the poverty line in N and the poverty rate would have been N N instead of N N under the alternative <unk>

 bally manufacturing corp. and new york developer donald trump have agreed in principle to a $ N million settlement of shareholder litigation stemming from bally 's alleged <unk> payment to mr. trump 
 according to lawyers familiar with the settlement talks the <unk> agreement to end a lawsuit filed more than two years ago was reached last week and will soon be submitted to a federal judge in <unk> n.j

 lawyers for shareholders bally and mr. trump all declined to talk publicly about the proposed settlement citing a request by a federal court <unk> not to reveal details of the agreement until it is completed 
 but some attorneys who are familiar with the matter said the $ N million payment will be shared by bally and mr. trump with the casino and hotel concern probably paying the bulk of the money 
 the amount bally and mr. trump will pay to settle the class-action suit <unk> in comparison to the $ N million walt disney co. and saul steinberg 's reliance group holdings inc. agreed to pay to settle a similar suit in july 
 that settlement represented the first time shareholders were granted a major payment in a <unk> case 
 mr. steinberg made a $ N million profit on the sale to disney of his investment in the company in N 
 but lawyers said mr. steinberg probably faced much more potential liability because when he sued disney during his takeover battle he filed on behalf of all shareholders 
 when disney offered to pay mr. steinberg a premium for his shares the new york investor did n't demand the company also pay a premium to other shareholders 
 when mr. trump sued bally he sued only on behalf of himself 
 mr. trump and bally also appeared to have some leverage in the case because in the state of delaware where bally is incorporated courts have held that <unk> is often protected by the <unk> rule 
 that rule gives boards of directors wide <unk> in deciding how to deal with dissident shareholders

 companies seeking to make insurers pay for pollution cleanup win court victory 
 in a case involving avondale industries inc. and its insurer travelers cos. the second u.s. circuit court of appeals in new york ruled in favor of the company on two issues that lawyers say are central to dozens of pollution cases around the country 
 travelers and other insurers have maintained that cleanup costs are n't damages and thus are n't covered under commercial policies 
 they also have argued that government proceedings <unk> a company of potential responsibility do n't fit the legal definition of a lawsuit thus such <unk> proceedings are n't covered by the policies the insurers say 
 the appeals court disagreed on both counts 
 avondale was notified by louisiana officials in N that it was potentially responsible for a cleanup at an <unk> plant 
 avondale asked travelers to defend it in the state proceeding but the insurer did n't respond 
 the appeals court upheld a district judge 's ruling that the insurer had to defend the company in such proceedings 
 the appeals court also said we think an ordinary businessman reading this policy would have believed himself covered for the demands and potential damage claims stemming from any cleanup 
 this decision will have a very considerable impact said kenneth <unk> professor of environmental law and insurance law at the university of virginia because many commercial insurance policies are issued by companies based in new york 
 william <unk> an attorney for the chemical manufacturers association said that while other appeals courts have ruled differently on whether cleanup costs are damages the influence of the appeals court in new york will make insurers sit up and listen 
 he said the decision was the first in which a federal appeals court has ruled whether administrative government proceedings qualify as litigation 
 barry r. <unk> an attorney for travelers said there are procedural bases on which this case will be appealed further

 under the proposed agreement involving the world 's <unk> building chicago-based sears would receive about half the money through conventional mortgage financing and the other half as a convertible mortgage

 convertible mortgages have become an increasingly popular way to finance prestigious buildings of late

 during the term the lender can either receive a percentage of cash flow a percentage of the building 's appreciation or a fixed return 
 the main advantage of a convertible mortgage is that it is not a sale and therefore does not trigger costly transfer taxes and <unk> 
 sears said it would put the <unk> tower on the block almost a year ago as part of its anti-takeover restructuring 
 but japanese institutions <unk> away from bidding on the <unk> tower out of fear their purchase of the property would trigger <unk> sentiment 
 last summer sears appeared to have a deal with canadian developer olympia & york developments ltd 
 but that deal fell through in september after it became clear that the sale would lead to a major real estate tax <unk> raising property taxes and making it difficult to lease the building at competitive prices 
 real estate industry executives said sears ' investment banker goldman sachs & co. sought financing in japan

 such high-yield debt is similar to a zero-coupon bond in that it is sold at a discount to face value with interest <unk> instead of being paid to the holder 
 under current rules that accrued interest is deductible by the company issuing the debt 
 the house version of the legislation would kill that deduction and label any such debt as equity which is n't deductible 
 the <unk> senate version would defer the <unk> for roughly five years 
 you see these in just about every lbo said robert <unk> senior vice president in charge of tax issues at shearson lehman hutton inc. in new york 
 it becomes a source of cash for the company making the lbo because it gets a deduction and does n't have to repay the debt for several years 
 typically mr. <unk> estimates this type of debt makes up N N to N N of the financing for lbos 
 these types of bonds have been used in buy-outs of companies such as rjr nabisco inc. storer communications inc. and <unk> co 
 a second provision passed by the senate and house would eliminate a rule allowing companies that post losses resulting from lbo debt to receive refunds of taxes paid over the previous three years 
 for example if a company posted a loss of $ N million from buy-out interest payments the existing rule would allow the concern to be able to receive a refund from the tax it paid from N through N when it may have been a profitable public company 
 but that rule is being virtually <unk> by wall street which is concentrating on coping with the deduction issue 
 prices for lbos have to come down if you do n't have that feature argued lawrence <unk> managing director for merchant banking at donaldson lufkin & jenrette securities corp. in new york 
 several wall street officials say the proposed legislation already is having an impact 
 an investment group led by chicago 's <unk> family recently lowered a $ N billion bid for american medical international beverly hills calif. because of the threat of the legislation 
 moreover one investment banker who requested <unk> said his firm did n't raise the <unk> for a target company earlier this month after a stronger bid emerged from a public company that was n't concerned about the financing provision 
 we would have paid more if we thought that law was n't going to pass he said 
 one possible solution for wall street is to increase the equity part of the transaction that is give lenders a bigger stake in the surviving company rather than just interest payments 
 that would force the buy-out firm and the target company 's management to reduce their level of ownership 
 the pigs in the trough may have to give a little bit of the <unk> back and then the deal can go through said peter c. <unk> tax partner at <unk> lipton rosen & katz 
 another solution said a tax lawyer who requested <unk> is for firms to use convertible bonds that sell at a discount 
 since they have a lower interest rate they would n't fall under the junk-bond category that would lose its <unk> 
 the house version of the bill would make debt <unk> if it pays five percentage points above treasury notes has at least a five-year maturity and does n't pay interest for at least one year out of the first five 
 the bill would then declare that the debt is equity and therefore is n't deductible 
 the senate bill would only deny the deduction until interest is actually paid 
 currently even though the issuer does n't pay tax the debt holder is taxed on the accrued interest 
 but those holders are often foreign investors and tax-exempt pension funds that do n't pay taxes on their holdings 
 the senate estimates that its version of the provision would yield $ N million the first year and a total of $ N million over five years 
 the house version would raise slightly more 
 even if wall street finds ways around the new rules a senate aide contends lbos will become somewhat more difficult 
 there 's no question it will make lbos more expensive he said 
 the interest deduction was the engine that made these things more productive 
 the average publicly offered commodity fund fell N N in september largely because of the volatile markets in foreign currencies according to norwood securities 
 the firm said that losers outnumbered gainers by more than three to one among the N funds it tracks 
 for the first nine months of the year norwood said the average fund has lost N N 
 the government moved aggressively to open the <unk> of federal aid for victims of the california earthquake but its <unk> of emergency funds must be <unk> soon if the aid is to continue 
 president bush signed a disaster declaration covering seven northern california counties 
 the declaration immediately made the counties eligible for temporary housing grants and low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses 
 in addition an unusually wide array of federal agencies moved to provide specialized assistance 
 the department of housing and urban development prepared to make as many as N vacant houses available for those left homeless the agriculture department was set to <unk> food from the <unk> program to earthquake victims and the pentagon was providing everything from radio communications to blood <unk> to military police for <unk> traffic 
 but the pool of federal <unk> funds already is running low because of the heavy costs of cleaning up hurricane hugo and congress will be under pressure to <unk> more money quickly 
 in hugo 's wake congress allocated $ N billion in relief funds and white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said $ N million of that money remains and could be diverted for quick expenditures related to the earthquake 
 now though enormous costs for earthquake relief will pile on top of outstanding costs for hurricane relief 
 that obviously means that we wo n't have enough for all of the <unk> that are now facing us and we will have to consider appropriate requests for <unk> funding mr. fitzwater said 
 the federal government is n't even attempting yet to estimate how much the earthquake will cost it 
 but mr. fitzwater said there will be i think quite obviously a very large amount of money required from all levels of government 
 in congress lawmakers already are looking for ways to add relief funds 
 money could be added to a pending spending bill covering the federal emergency management agency which <unk> federal disaster relief 
 more likely relief funds could be added to an omnibus spending bill that congress is to begin considering next week 
 but it is n't just washington 's relief dollars that are spread thin its relief manpower also is stretched 
 fema still has special disaster centers open to handle the aftermath of hugo and spokesman russell <unk> acknowledged that we 're pretty thin 
 mr. <unk> says fema now possibly may have the heaviest <unk> in its history 
 to further complicate relief efforts the privately funded american red cross also finds itself strapped for funds after its big hugo operation 
 it 's been a bad month <unk> and every other way said <unk> stewart a spokeswoman for the red cross 
 it just makes it a little rough when you have to worry about the budget 
 the red cross has opened N shelters in the bay area serving N people 
 <unk> trucks capable of cooking food were dispatched from other states 
 all the precise types of federal aid that will be sent to california wo n't be determined until state officials make specific requests to fema agency officials said 
 and in the confusion after the earthquake the information flow is a little slow coming in from the affected area said carl <unk> a fema spokesman 
 still some aid is moving <unk> from washington almost immediately 
 hud officials said they will make available as many as N bay area houses that are under hud loans but now are vacant after the houses have been <unk> to ensure they are sound 
 additional housing <unk> and certificates will be made available officials said and some housing and <unk> funds may be shifted from other programs or made available for emergency use 
 another federal agency not normally associated with disaster relief the internal revenue service moved quickly as well 
 the irs said it will waive certain tax penalties for earthquake victims unable to meet return deadlines or make payments because of the quake 's devastation 
 the agency plans to announce specific relief procedures in the coming days 
 and the treasury said residents of the san francisco area will be able to cash in savings bonds even if they have n't held them for the minimum six-month period 
 one advantage that federal officials have in handling earthquake relief is the large number of military facilities in the san francisco bay area facilities that provide a ready base of supplies and workers 
 even before the full extent of the devastation was known defense secretary dick cheney ordered the military services to set up an emergency command center in the pentagon and prepare to respond to various fema requests for assistance 
 by yesterday afternoon air force transport planes began moving additional rescue and medical supplies physicians communications equipment and fema personnel to california 
 a military jet flew a congressional delegation and senior bush administration officials to survey the damage 
 and the pentagon said dozens of additional crews and transport aircraft were on alert awaiting orders to move emergency supplies 
 two air force facilities near sacramento and <unk> air force base N miles northeast of san francisco were designated to serve as <unk> centers 
 some victims also were treated at the <unk> army medical center in san francisco and at the naval hospital in oakland 
 in addition N military police from the <unk> a military base in san francisco are <unk> with traffic control and a navy ship was moved from a naval station at <unk> island near the bay bridge to san francisco to help fight fires 
 to help residents in northern california rebuild fema intends to set up N disaster assistance offices in the earthquake area in the next several days and to staff them with N to N workers from various agencies said robert <unk> chief of the agency 's individual assistance division 
 at these offices earthquake victims will be helped in filling out a <unk> form that they will need to qualify for such federal assistance as <unk> loans and to repair houses 
 and federal officials are promising to move rapidly with federal highway aid to rebuild the area 's severely damaged road system 
 the federal highway administration has an emergency relief program to help states and local governments repair federally funded highways and bridges seriously damaged by natural disasters 
 the account currently has $ N million 
 and though federal law <unk> that only $ N million can be <unk> from that fund in any one state per disaster administration officials expect congress to move in to <unk> spending more now in california 
 to get that money states must go through an elaborate approval process but officials expect red tape to be cut this time 
 keith <unk> special assistant to federal highway administrator thomas <unk> also said that after the N san fernando earthquake in southern california the state set tougher standards for bridges and with federal aid began a program to <unk> highways and bridges for earthquake hazards 
 the first phase of the program has been completed but two other <unk> are continuing 
 the two major structures that failed tuesday night he said were both built well before the N earthquake the san francisco bay bridge completed in the 1930s and the section of <unk> built in the 1950s 
 the <unk> section had completed the first phase of the <unk>

 it earned $ N million or $ N a share in the N quarter 
 general dynamics credited significant earnings gains in its general aviation and material service segments an earnings recovery in <unk> operations and higher military aircraft sales 
 northrop said sales fell because of the decline in b-2 development dollars from the government as the plane continues its initial production stage and because fewer <unk> fighter sections are being produced in its <unk> work with prime contractor mcdonnell douglas corp 
 in composite trading on the new york stock exchange northrop shares closed at $ N off N cents

 lotus development corp. reported a surprisingly strong N N increase in third-quarter net income on a N N sales gain buoyed by strong demand for a new version of its N computer <unk>

 silicon valley <unk> a sigh of relief yesterday 
 though details were <unk> in the aftermath of the violent earthquake that shook the high-tech <unk> along with the rest of the san francisco bay area a spot check of computer makers turned up little if any potentially <unk> damage to facilities or fabrication equipment 
 analysts and corporate officials said they expected practically no long-term disruption in shipments from the valley of either hardware or software goods 
 intel corp. advanced micro devices inc. and national semiconductor corp. were all up and running yesterday though many workers were forced to stay home because of damaged roadways others elected to take the day off 
 these systems are more <unk> than many people would believe said thomas <unk> who tracks the computer industry for merrill lynch research 
 it 's not the end of the world if you shake them up a little bit

 still many were confident that in a day or two everything should be back to normal according to a spokeswoman for the semiconductor industry association based in cupertino 
 ibm for instance said it anticipates returning to a normal work schedule by the weekend at its san jose plant which puts out disk drives for the N family of mainframes 
 a hewlett-packard spokeswoman said that while things are a big mess some N valley employees have been called back to work today 
 apple computer added that it was being cautiously optimistic despite not yet closely <unk> all of its N buildings in the region 
 even the carefully <unk> machinery in its giant <unk> plant to the north of the valley was believed to be <unk> 
 sun microsystems inc. and tandem computers inc. also signaled that they should recover quickly 
 digital equipment corp. with major facilities in santa clara cupertino palo alto and mountain view said that all of its engineering and manufacturing sites had reported to corporate headquarters in maynard mass. tuesday night 
 none sustained significant damage a spokesman said adding that the delicate manufacturing process machines were <unk> and were all found to be operating normally 
 for many companies of course there is still a slew of nagging problems to <unk> with some of which have the potential to become quite serious 
 for example a spokesman for advanced micro devices said the sunnyvale chip maker is worried about <unk> 
 a sudden surge or drop in electric power could <unk> integrated circuits being built 
 but given what might have happened to the fragile parts that are at the heart of the <unk> business the bulk of valley companies seemed to be just about shouting <unk> 
 several factors apparently <unk> the valley a <unk> suburban stretch from san jose to palo alto from the kind of impact felt in san francisco an hour 's drive north 
 for one thing buildings there tend to be newer and thus in step with the latest safety codes 
 also the soil in the valley is solid unlike the landfill of san francisco 's downtown marina district which was hit with fires and vast destruction 
 in addition some <unk> companies said they were prepared for <unk> conditions like tuesday 's 
 their machine tools are even <unk> to the shop floor 
 intel said that over the past decade it has installed computer <unk> and <unk> <unk> sensitive to the shake of an earthquake in the pipes that <unk> through its plants 
 like other large valley companies intel also noted that it has factories in several parts of the nation so that a breakdown at one location should n't leave customers in a total <unk> 
 that 's certainly good news for such companies as compaq computer corp. houston which has only a four-day supply of microprocessors from the valley on hand because of a <unk> manufacturing approach that limits the buildup of inventory

 john r. <unk> <unk> to this article 
 michael maynard offered the world a faster way to break eggs 
 as thanks the egg industry tried to break him 
 and the egg producers have done a pretty good job 
 they tried to put mr. maynard out of business by an act of congress 
 <unk> lobbying helped persuade six states to ban mr. maynard 's automatic <unk> machine because of fears over salmonella 
 his company <unk> manufacturing inc. was forced to seek protection from creditors under federal bankruptcy law in N and has since been liquidated 
 monthly sales of his egg king machine which he now is marketing through a new company have <unk> to about half a dozen from a peak of N says the <unk> businessman 
 mr. maynard is n't the first entrepreneur to <unk> up against entrenched interests 
 but his case is notable both for the scale of the fight it is n't often that a congressional hearing is held to determine whether one small businessman is a threat to the republic and for what it tells about the <unk> of marketing a new product 
 now one might ask why people who sell eggs would fight someone who is trying to make it easier to crack them 
 part of the answer lies in the nature of the industry 
 many larger egg producers are also egg processors who crack <unk> and <unk> billions of eggs turning them into <unk> <unk> or frozen egg products 
 however dozens of <unk> restaurant chefs and other food <unk> who <unk> to mr. maynard 's defense say that products ranging from egg bread to <unk> lose some zip when the eggs come in <unk> cans instead of <unk> 
 but for companies that use hundreds of eggs a day breaking them by hand can get well out of hand 
 the idea behind the egg king is pretty simple put the eggs into a <unk> that contains <unk> baskets spin them at a high speed to break the <unk> and strain the <unk> part through the baskets 
 one egg king which at just under four feet tall and two feet wide has been <unk> to the robot <unk> can crack about N eggs an hour 
 because fresh eggs are less expensive than processed ones a big egg user can recover the egg king 's $ N cost in a few months says mr. maynard 
 such <unk> egg breakers have been around since the <unk> 
 but when mr. maynard came forward with his machine in the early 1970s nobody else was offering them in the u.s. 
 the main reason salmonella 
 <unk> carry this bacteria which can cause upset <unk> and in rare cases death among people 
 <unk> sometimes pass salmonella to the eggs and it can also be found on <unk> <unk> 
 thus any machine that breaks large amounts of eggs at once has the potential to spread salmonella if a bad egg gets in with the good ones 
 mr. maynard claims this is a <unk> problem 
 the egg king carries written instructions to break only high-grade eggs that have been properly <unk> and as an added <unk> to use the eggs only in products that will be <unk> enough to kill bacteria 
 with nearly N machines in use there have been no salmonella problems as long as instructions were followed mr. maynard boasts 
 he says the handful of salmonella cases involving products that may have used eggs broken by an egg king stemmed from a failure to adequately cook the products 
 but he says that 's no more a reason for banning egg <unk> than bad drivers are a reason for banning cars 
 opponents do n't buy such arguments 
 human nature being what it is people do n't always follow instructions says jack <unk> chief of food protection for the new york state health department 
 leading the assault against the egg king has been united egg producers 
 the <unk> ga. trade group has issued a briefing book that claims the machine is a health hazard and that mr. maynard is trying to make a fast buck at the expense of the nation 's egg producers 
 the <unk> declines to comment but the group 's attorney alfred <unk> says the group 's actions are motivated solely by health concerns 
 an early <unk> was the u.s. department of agriculture 
 mr. maynard initially won approval for his machine to be used at <unk> facilities regulated by the <unk> 's food safety inspection service 
 unfortunately for mr. maynard another branch of the <unk> the agricultural marketing service was in charge of eggs 
 after receiving complaints from egg producers this branch got the other branch to <unk> its approval thus limiting the machine 's potential market to <unk> and restaurants and other <unk> that are n't regulated by the <unk> 
 the egg producers also lobbied the food and drug administration 
 but the fda in a N letter to the united egg producers said that there was little likelihood of a health problem as long as instructions were followed 
 so the producers went to capitol hill where a congressman from georgia introduced a measure to ban <unk> <unk> machines 
 mr. maynard whose company at the time was based in santa ana calif. <unk> his local congressman and the battle was joined 
 mr. maynard 's forces finally defeated the measure though it took a vote on the floor of the house of representatives to do it 
 even then opponents managed to get a congressional hearing to examine what one congressman called an unscrupulous method for breaking eggs 
 <unk> in their effort to get a national ban the egg producers turned their attention to the states 
 so far new york new jersey nebraska georgia michigan and minnesota have outlawed mr. maynard 's device citing health concerns 
 an antitrust suit that mr. maynard 's company filed in los angeles federal court against the united egg producers and others only added to the entrepreneur 's woes 
 the judge dismissed the suit and ordered mr. maynard 's company to pay over $ N in legal fees to the defendants ' lawyers 
 mr. maynard says the ruling pushed his company into bankruptcy court 
 now he has moved to oklahoma where costs are lower and started a new company <unk> inc. to market his machine 
 but so far the change of <unk> has n't ended his string of bad breaks 
 mr. maynard recently fell from a horse and <unk> his arm

 however mr. <unk> directs his own material without <unk> and at its own <unk> pace baker boys is both <unk> and funny 
 he 's put a fresh spin on material that could come off <unk> <unk> for example the way <unk> <unk> an audience the first time she <unk> with the baker boys 
 of course it does n't hurt that mr. <unk> has made up for his lack of experience behind the camera with technicians who know exactly what they 're doing

 though ms. pfeiffer has the flashy part she gets the best comic <unk> and to wear glamorous <unk> and <unk> heels the boys are pretty great too 
 what seemed like a good idea to cast the bridges brothers jeff and <unk> as the baker brothers actually turned out to be a good idea 
 anyone who 's tried to appear natural in front of a camera knows that it 's much more natural to end up looking like a stiff 
 so it 's quite possible that the <unk> play between the brothers is n't natural at all that jeff and <unk> had to work like crazy to make their <unk> love and <unk> and frustration and rage seem so very real 
 when the movie opens the baker brothers are doing what they 've done for N years <unk> and twice as long as that for themselves they 're playing <unk> piano face-to-face on <unk> <unk>

 he 's got a wife and two kids and a house in the <unk> the audience sees only the house and only near the end of the movie

 looking <unk> than he has in a while the younger mr. bridges 's jack is <unk> and <unk> and a far <unk> case than frank who 's managed to <unk> his dreams to fit reality without feeling too <unk>

 it matches her voice 
 and ms. pfeiffer 's particular version of making <unk> and the way mr. <unk> photographs her from the tips of her red high heels right up her <unk> red <unk> dress might make you think of <unk> <unk> if ms. pfeiffer had n't gone and become a star in her own right

 money-market mutual fund assets grew at nearly three times their usual rate in the latest week as investors opted for safety instead of the stock market 
 money-fund assets soared $ N billion in the week ended tuesday to a record $ N billion according to <unk> 's money fund report a <unk> <unk> newsletter 
 we were expecting it following the fall of the dow friday said <unk> <unk> <unk> editor of money fund report 
 it 's the <unk> flight to safety 
 despite recent declines in interest rates money funds continue to offer better yields than other comparable investments 
 the average seven-day compound yield on the N taxable funds tracked by <unk> 's was N N in the latest week down from N N 
 compound yields assume reinvestment of dividends and that current yields continue for a year 
 most short-term certificates of deposit are yielding about N N or less at major banks and the yields on treasury bills sold at monday 's auction fell to N N for three months and N N for six months 
 money-fund assets have been rising at an average rate of $ N billion a week in recent months ms. <unk> said reflecting the relatively high yields 
 in the latest week funds open to institutions alone grew by $ N billion 
 some fund managers say inflows could increase in coming days as a result of stock selling in the wake of friday 's N point drop in the dow jones industrial average 
 if you 're selling equities you do n't start getting proceeds for five to seven days said frank <unk> who manages the kemper money market fund 
 neal <unk> marketing vice president for fidelity investments said inflows friday into fidelity 's <unk> and cash reserves money-market funds were about twice normal levels with about half coming from equity and junk-bond funds 
 monday and tuesday were lackluster in comparison he said 
 people are n't necessarily running scared mr. <unk> said 
 they 're maintaining their attitude toward investing which has <unk> toward the conservative recently 
 money-fund yields tend to lag <unk> trends as portfolio managers adjust the maturities of their investments short-term treasury securities commercial paper and the like to capture the highest yields 
 maturities usually are shorter when rates are rising and longer when they are falling 
 the average maturity of the funds tracked by <unk> 's remained at N days for the third consecutive week 
 it was as short as N days at the start of this year when rates were <unk> steadily upward and hit N days in august 
 the average seven-day simple yield of the funds fell to N N this week from N N 
 the average 30-day simple yield was N N compared with N N the week before and the 30-day compound yield slid to N N from N N

 whose della femina mcnamee wcrs agency created <unk> joe <unk> among others announced a massive restructuring that largely <unk> it from the advertising business and includes selling the majority of its advertising unit to <unk> eurocom 
 the complex restructuring which was long expected <unk> london-based wcrs from primarily a <unk> of advertising into one of europe 's largest buyers of advertising time and space 
 it also creates a newly merged world-wide ad agency controlled by eurocom and headed jointly by new york ad man jerry della femina and two top wcrs executives 
 the merged agency 's <unk> ambitious goal to become one of the world 's N largest agencies while attracting more multinational clients than the agencies were able to attract alone 
 wcrs 's restructuring reflects the growing importance of media buying in europe where the only way to get a good price on advertising time and space is to buy it in bulk 
 for eurocom meanwhile the move gives it a strong u.s. <unk> in della femina and more than <unk> the size of its ad agency business world-wide 
 it also gives the outspoken mr. della femina who often generates as much publicity for himself as for his clients an international platform that he most certainly wo n't be loath to use 
 according to terms wcrs will pay N billion french francs $ N million for the N N it does n't already own of carat holding s.a. one of europe 's largest media buyers 
 meanwhile eurocom which had held N N of wcrs 's ad unit will pay # N million $ N million to raise its stake to N N 
 that price also covers eurocom raising to N N its N N stake in europe 's <unk> group a joint venture ad agency network it owns with wcrs 
 eurocom will also have the right to buy the remaining N N of the merged ad agency group in six years 
 the transaction places the three executives <unk> at the helm of a major agency with the rather <unk> name of eurocom wcrs della femina ball ltd. or <unk> 
 the merged agency will include della femina mcnamee based in new york eurocom 's various agencies in france the <unk> group in europe and wcrs 's other advertising and direct marketing operations 
 mr. della femina will be joint chairman with former wcrs executive robin <unk> 
 both will report to tim <unk> a former wcrs executive who will be chief executive officer at the new agency 
 in an interview in new york mr. <unk> fresh from a <unk> flight from paris where executives had worked through most of the night outlined big plans for the new agency 
 our goal is to develop quite rapidly to a <unk> position by the end of three years from now 
 it implies very dramatic growth he said 
 he added that eurocom and wcrs had agreed to provide a development fund of # N million for acquisitions 
 the new agency group is already in discussions about a possible purchase in spain while mr. <unk> said it also plans to make acquisitions in <unk> germany and elsewhere 
 <unk> the top N within three years will be difficult at best 
 della femina had billings of just $ N million last year and ranked as the u.s. 's <unk> ad agency 
 the merged company that it now becomes part of will have billings of just more than $ N billion most of that in europe bringing it to about <unk> world-wide 
 to make it to <unk> status it would have to <unk> over such <unk> forces as grey advertising d'arcy <unk> benton & <unk> and <unk> 's ddb needham 
 the merged agency 's game plan to attract multinational packaged-goods advertisers may prove equally difficult 
 when wcrs created della femina mcnamee out of the merger of three smaller agency units in N it said it did so in order to attract larger clients especially packaged-goods companies 
 since then della femina won pan am as an international client and also does work for a few packaged-goods clients including dow chemical co. 's <unk> wrap 
 but major packaged-goods players of the world such as procter & gamble colgate-palmolive and unilever have <unk> <unk> the agency 
 three of our favorite names mr. della femina calls that <unk> adding hopefully we 're a much more attractive agency to large <unk> today than we were yesterday 
 still the restructuring could create one of the most powerful alliances between advertising and <unk> firms that europe has seen 
 as part of the restructuring wcrs and eurocom said they will look for ways to combine their media buying across europe 
 what 's more both eurocom and brothers francis and <unk> gross who founded carat will acquire N N stakes in wcrs group creating a powerful link between eurocom and carat 
 carat will receive its wcrs stake as part of payment for the N N carat stake that wcrs is buying while eurocom said it expects to pay about # N million for its wcrs stake 
 mr. della femina says he plans to remain heavily involved in the creative product at the world-wide agency serving as a sort of creative <unk> 
 <unk> mcnamee della femina 's president will continue running the u.s. agency day-to-day 
 they and other top executives signed long-term employment contracts and mr. della femina will receive an additional multimillion-dollar sum which some industry executives pegged at about $ N million 
 wcrs group for its part will now be able to follow its longstanding plan of becoming a holding company for a series of <unk> businesses said peter scott the firm 's chief executive 
 in addition to carat wcrs will hold onto its public relations tv programming and other businesses 
 wcrs says its debt will be cut to # N million from # N million as a result of the transaction 
 for carat meanwhile the alliance with eurocom and wcrs is intended to strengthen its own push outside france 
 carat 's gross brothers invented the idea of large-scale buying of media space 
 by buying the space in bulk they obtain discounts as high as N N which they can pass on to customers 
 they thus have won the french <unk> business of such advertising giants as coca-cola co. fiat s.p a. gillette and kodak 
 but now other agencies are getting into the business with their own competing <unk> groups and carat wants to expand to the rest of europe 
 to help finance the carat purchase wcrs said it plans an issue of <unk> preferred shares once the market <unk> down 
 but wcrs added that in the light of the current uncertainty in the equity markets it has arranged <unk> debt financing which would be underwritten by samuel <unk> & co. ltd 
 earthquake 's damage

 honda motor co. the first japanese auto maker to ship cars to japan from the u.s. is now exporting more than N accord <unk> a year from its <unk> ohio factory 
 one of the most remarkable features of the forced <unk> of the ethnic <unk> out of <unk> over the past five months has been the lack of international attention 
 the <unk> of more than N men women and children by the <unk> regime adds up to one of the largest <unk> seen in the postwar years 
 yet some people are advancing a <unk> <unk> that what we are seeing is somehow the <unk> result of the historical <unk> committed by the <unk> in the <unk> century 
 today 's <unk> in <unk> in other words deserve what is coming to them four centuries later 
 as if this were n't enough the senate judiciary committee is getting into the act 
 on tuesday it approved senator bob dole 's proposed <unk> resolution <unk> april N N as the national day of <unk> of the <unk> anniversary of the <unk> <unk> of N suffered at the hands of the <unk> <unk> empire 
 there can be no <unk> that the <unk> <unk> terrible suffering but one has to wonder what possible good such a resolution will achieve 
 it puts great strain on a longstanding u.s. friendship with turkey a country that has been one of america 's strongest allies in nato 
 the resolution also comes at a time when turkey has been seeking help from the united states in <unk> its <unk> emigration controversy and pursuing democratic reforms that may lead to membership in the european community 
 turkey has been fighting its past for years and thus far has been only partially successful 
 must it now accept that one of its strongest allies blames it for the <unk> of another people 
 such sentiment only encourages the adverse feelings toward turkey that surfaced when turkey asked for assistance in dealing with its <unk> emigration crisis 
 mr. dole 's odd effort notwithstanding most of turkey 's political problems lie with the europeans 
 part of the problem some europeans have with turkey seems to stem from its location turkey is n't really part of europe 
 why they wonder should it belong to the ec 
 another <unk> hook is the <unk> faith of the majority of the <unk> people turkey we are told is not a christian nation its people simply wo n't fit in with the western european <unk> tradition 
 it 's when these <unk> fall on <unk> <unk> that the old <unk> of <unk> for treatment at the hands of the <unk> empire comes to the <unk> 
 no one has to accept the <unk> of the <unk> empire to reject that argument 
 turkey in any event is long past it 
 the country has in recent years accepted more than N refugees from at least four <unk> nations 
 <unk> suffering what many people consider to be a current <unk> campaign at the hands of <unk> iran and <unk> have <unk> eastern turkey 
 now it is their fellow <unk> <unk> as refugees from <unk> 
 the <unk> <unk> tragedy and the ongoing crisis can not be ignored and <unk> off to that notorious <unk> of history that has become so convenient recently 
 surely the past suffering of any people at any time can not be simply filed away and forgotten 
 but what the senate judiciary committee has done in supporting the strongly <unk> <unk> resolution <unk> no useful end it merely produces more controversy and <unk> memories 
 congress has enough difficulty dealing with the realities of the world as it currently exists 
 <unk> 's government has been <unk> beyond the pale for months and the u.s. does its values no credit by ignoring that while casting its votes into the past 
 many in washington say president bush will have to raise taxes to pay for his war on drugs 
 we have a better idea <unk> hud to pay for the war on drugs 
 housing and urban development 's budget is $ N billion 
 from what we and the nation have been reading the money is n't being spent very well 
 the single most important contribution the government could make now to help the poor is to get the specter of drugs out of their neighborhoods 
 if that takes money take it away from this <unk> federal department 
 but of course the democrats <unk> hud in hearings and in the press have no such solution in mind 
 instead they 're scrambling to protect the very programs at the heart of the hud scandal 
 this month hud secretary jack kemp unveiled a series of proposed reforms to improve management at hud 
 no doubt many of his ideas are worthy but ultimately he is proposing to make fundamentally flawed programs work slightly more fairly and efficiently 
 congress is unlikely to go even that far 
 last week secretary kemp ran into a <unk> of criticism from house banking committee members 
 they were <unk> for instance that he wanted to target more of the $ N billion community development block grant <unk> program to low-income projects and zero out the notorious discretionary funds that have allowed hud officials to steer contracts to political <unk> 
 these development grants mainly <unk> developers who want to put up shopping centers and parking <unk> 
 they also give those in congress political credit for bringing home the pork and so they are popular with such members as mary rose <unk> 
 rep. <unk> a democrat from cleveland wants a $ N million grant so cleveland can build an <unk> rock and roll hall of fame 
 she says it 'd create N jobs and bring cleveland tourist revenue 
 hud says the project does n't qualify and mr. kemp says that rock <unk> roll musicians and the music industry ought to put up the money 
 at the hearing rep. <unk> started <unk> about <unk> <unk> regulations that would stand between her and housing for downtown cleveland 
 rep. <unk> <unk> an ohio republican rallied to the cause i think the <unk> is making an important statement 
 the implication that if a congressman calls about a project in his district there 's something wrong i think is most unfortunate 
 we 're sure some <unk> can explain the difference between what the republican consultants have been doing with hud and what these <unk> and <unk> want to do with hud 
 our view is that given congress 's attitude toward hud the place probably is beyond reform 
 for more than N years the federal government has tried various ways to provide housing for the poor and revive cities 
 in the process hud has wasted <unk> billions created <unk> and invited corruption 
 much of hud 's spending actually is <unk> welfare for developers or the middle class 
 that includes the <unk> funds and the federal housing administration which loans out money for private home mortgages and has just been discovered to be $ N billion in the hole 
 selling the fha 's loan portfolio to the highest bidder would save the taxpayers <unk> billions in future losses 
 some hud money actually does <unk> down to the poor and <unk> out housing middlemen would free up more money for public housing tenants to manage and even own their units 
 the rest ought to be used to clean out drugs from the <unk> 
 rival gangs have turned cities into combat zones 
 even suburban prince george 's county md. reported last week there have been a record N killings there this year most of them drug-related 
 innocent <unk> often are the victims 
 a man in a <unk> was <unk> down in the <unk> of a miami drug battle 
 a <unk> brooklyn boy was used as a shield by a drug dealer 
 decent life in the inner cities wo n't be restored unless the government <unk> the streets from the drug gangs 
 until then the billions hud spends on inner-city housing simply is wasted 
 it 's still unclear whether secretary kemp wants to completely overhaul the engine room at hud or just tighten a few <unk> here and there 
 no doubt he believes the place can be <unk> 
 having seen the <unk> with which congress has addressed the hud scandals we disagree 
 it 's time to scrap the politically <unk> spending machine hud has become and channel the resources into the drug war 
 <unk> <unk> was named chairman and chief executive officer of this grocery chain 
 mr. <unk> N years old succeeds <unk> <unk> jr. who died in a plane crash on sunday at the age of N 
 <unk> <unk> retains his position as president 
 natural <unk> and most particularly earthquakes are not only horrible realities in and of themselves but also <unk> through which the state of a society can be <unk> 
 the rubble after the <unk> earthquake a year ago disclosed quite literally a city whose larger structures had been built with sand 
 the extent of the disaster stemmed from years of <unk> and bureaucratic <unk> 
 the larger parallel after the earthquake centered south of san francisco is surely with the state of the u.s. economy 
 did the stock-market tremors of friday oct. N <unk> larger <unk> far greater <unk> 
 are the engineering and architecture of the economy as vulnerable as the <unk> of the bay bridge 
 the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> era has produced <unk> <unk> about the present <unk> of u.s. economic and social arrangements 
 a licensed government intellectual francis <unk> recently announced in the national interest that history is so to speak at an end since the course of human progress has now <unk> in the <unk> full stop of american <unk> 
 his <unk> were taken seriously 
 but we are in reality <unk> the continuing decline of the political economy of capitalism not so much the end of history but the history of the end 
 the financial equivalent of the sand used by those <unk> contractors is junk bonds and the leveraged buy-outs associated with them 
 builders get away with using sand and financiers junk when society decides it 's <unk> necessary even to look the other way 
 and by the early 1980s u.s. capitalists had ample reason to welcome junk bonds to look the other way 
 by that time they found extremely low profit rates from <unk> corporate investment 
 government statistics in fact show that the profit rate net pretax profits divided by capital stock peaked in N at N N 
 that same <unk> saw profit rates fall to N N in the recession year N and the supposed <unk> that followed has seen the profit rate rise only to N N in N and N N in N 
 corresponding to the fall in profit rates was in the early 1980s the drop in the number arrived at if you divide the market value of firms by the replacement costs of their assets the famous <unk> ratio associated with prof. james <unk> 
 in theory the value attached to a firm by the market and the cost of replacing its assets should be the same 
 but of course the market could decide that the firm 's capital stock its assets means nothing if the firm is not producing profits 
 this is indeed what the market decided 
 by N the ratio was N N meaning that the market was <unk> every dollar 's worth of the average firm 's assets at N cents 
 from the history of capitalism we can take it as a sound bet that if it takes only N cents to buy a dollar 's worth of a firm 's capital stock an alert entrepreneur wo n't look the other way 
 his assumption is that the underlying profitability rate will go up and the capital assets he bought on the cheap will soon be producing profits thus restoring the market 's faith in them 
 hence the lbo craze 
 but here is where the entrepreneur made a very risky bet and where society was maybe <unk> to look the other way 
 the profit rate is still low and the <unk> ratio was only N N in N and N N in N 
 result a landscape <unk> with <unk> huge debt burdens <unk> down upon the <unk> and <unk> of corporate america 
 the mounting risks did not go <unk> even in the mid-1980s 
 but there were enough <unk> announcing the end of history in this case suspension of normal laws of economic <unk> for society to continue <unk> its eyes 
 mainstream economists and <unk> <unk> their <unk> up at the great <unk> of junk financing <unk> their heads to watch the <unk> of leveraged buy-outs claimed the end result would be a <unk> <unk> corporate america with soaring productivity and profits and the weaker gone to the wall 
 but this is not where the rewards of junk financing were found 
 the beneficiaries were those financiers whose <unk> was the topic figure of '80s capitalism michael <unk> 's $ N million salary in one year

 profit rates after the great merger wave are no higher and now we have an extremely high-interest burden relative to cash flow 
 the consequences of building <unk> with sand are showing up 
 in contrast to previous estimates <unk> the default rate on junk bonds at N N or N N a harvard study published in april of this year and discussed in a lead story in the wall street journal for sept. N found the default rate on these junk bonds is N N 
 what is the consequence of a high-interest burden high default rates and continued low profitability 
 corporations need liquidity in the form of borrowed funds 
 without liquidity from the junk-bond market or cash flow from profits they look to the government which <unk> <unk> the natural <unk> of the capitalist economy with charity in the form of cuts in the capital-gains tax rate or <unk> 
 the consequence can be inflation brought on as the effect of a desperate bid to avoid the <unk> shock of a sudden crash 
 attacks on inflation come with another strategy of capital of a very traditional sort an assault on wages 
 mr. <unk> <unk> through <unk> at the end of history said in his <unk> that the class issue has actually been successfully resolved in the west 
 the <unk> of modern america represents the essential achievement of the <unk> society <unk> by <unk> 
 mr. <unk> might want to <unk> some american workers on the subject of class and <unk> 
 from its peak in N of $ N the average american weekly wage had fallen to $ N in N both figures being expressed in N dollars 
 in other words after the glory boom of the reagan years wages had <unk> from the post world war ii peak by N N as capitalists helped by the government turned down the <unk> or went offshore 
 but there are signs now the strikes by miners boeing workers telephone workers etc. that this attack on wages is being more fiercely resisted 
 these are long-term richter <unk> on american capitalism 
 the whole structure is extremely shaky 
 governments have become sophisticated in handling moments of panic a word the london times <unk> my father to use when he was reporting the wall street crash in N

 japan air lines lufthansa german airlines and air france reportedly plan to form an international air-freight company this year a move that could further consolidate the industry 
 japanese newspaper <unk> <unk> <unk> reported that the three giants plan to integrate their cargo computers and <unk> and <unk> systems 
 they reportedly will invest a total of N billion yen $ N million in the venture whose headquarters would be in france or west germany 
 the action follows federal express corp. 's acquisition of flying tiger line inc. in august 
 after that it would make sense for airlines to talk about doing things jointly said cotton daly director of cargo services for new york consulting firm <unk> <unk> & <unk> inc 
 mr. daly said such discussions are motivated by the competitive threat posed by federal express united parcel service of america inc. and other fast-growing air-freight companies 
 many airlines are talking about cargo ventures and there have been rumors about such a tie between jal and european airlines 
 in tokyo a jal spokesman said he could n't confirm or deny the latest japanese report 
 but he said jal is talking to lufthansa and air france about some sort of cargo venture 
 it is just one of a number of strategies jal has <unk> upon to come to terms with the situation in europe after N the deadline for ending trade barriers in the ec he said 
 in frankfurt a lufthansa spokesman confirmed talks are under way but declined to comment 
 a lufthansa spokeswoman in tokyo said the head of lufthansa 's cargo operations had been in <unk> last week for talks with jal 
 in paris air france declined to comment 
 nothing is defined or signed at this point mr. daly said of the talks 
 whatever accord the three carriers reach he said he is skeptical it would create a separate airline 
 if the three companies pool their air-freight businesses their clout would be considerable 
 according to figures from the international air transport association they carried a combined N million tons of freight last year 
 federal express and flying tiger as separate companies carried a combined N million tons 
 air france and lufthansa last month concluded a far-reaching cooperation accord that includes air-freight activities 
 they plan to increase cooperation in freight <unk> and create a world-wide computer system to process cargo 
 other airlines would have access to the system they said and negotiations with partners were already under way 
 both european airlines operate extensive fleets of boeing N <unk> and N <unk> aircraft that carry both freight and passengers on the main deck 
 they currently have large orders for cargo planes 
 several airlines including lufthansa jal and cathay pacific airways are working on a so-called global cargo system and are trying to attract other carriers to join mr. daly said 
 jal also has signaled it is looking for <unk> in europe before the end of N 
 last month the carrier said it wanted to lease crews and planes from british airways so it could <unk> its passengers from london to other european <unk> 
 british airways said it has n't received a proposal from jal 
 but last week there were <unk> negotiations between the u.k. and japan a likely first step to any commercial agreement between jal and british airways or another u.k. carrier

 in a move to prevent any <unk> in the financial markets from the california earthquake the securities and exchange commission said it temporarily <unk> options listed on the pacific stock exchange to the american new york and philadelphia stock exchanges and to the chicago board options exchange 
 the decision which affects millions of dollars of trading positions was made late yesterday because the pacific exchange 's options floor was shut down as a result of tuesday 's earthquake 
 the sec faced with a major squeeze on options positions said it was necessary to ensure that options listed on the exchange could be traded today and tomorrow 
 sec chairman richard breeden said the cooperation by the exchanges would enable investors to buy and sell options listed solely on the pacific exchange <unk> the liquidity of the market 
 officials at the four exchanges said well over N traders from the pacific exchange were taking flights from san francisco late yesterday to the american new york and philadelphia exchanges and to the cboe where they would continue making markets in the <unk> options 
 the big board said <unk> quickly <unk> a new options floor to <unk> N traders from the pacific exchange 
 in addition specialists on the exchanges agreed to provide backup capital for <unk> in pacific exchange options traded on the exchanges 
 trading was light on the pacific stock exchange yesterday with workers at the exchange 's main floor in san francisco struggling to execute orders by <unk> as a result of a continuing power <unk> 
 the most pressing problem was the suspension of options trading 
 the pacific exchange has options for N underlying stock issues including highly active hilton hotels corp. which is listed on the big board 
 investors were concerned that they might be unable to exercise options that expire tomorrow 
 but professionals said throughout the day that the shutdown would n't be a cause for alarm even if it were to <unk> for several days 
 i 've told my staff and clients that they still have the ability to exercise their options because they are guaranteed by the options clearing corp. said michael schwartz a senior registered options strategist at oppenheimer & co 
 the sec <unk> trading in the options however to allow investors to do more than simply exercise the options 
 while the exchange 's equities floor in san francisco remained open on a limited basis orders were being <unk> and executed in los angeles 
 workers could dial out but they could n't receive telephone calls 
 it 's a very uncertain situation right now said <unk> <unk> administrative assistant of trading floor operations of the exchange which has daily volume of about N million shares 
 because the exchange 's computer was <unk> orders to the exchange 's trading operations in los angeles business is as usual mr. <unk> said 
 if one city is down the other can take over 
 meanwhile the brokerage firms in san francisco were trying to cope 
 charles <unk> chairman and chief executive officer of <unk> & co. said traders came to work at N a.m. <unk> many on foot because of uncertain road and traffic conditions but learned that they would have to await a required inspection by the city in order to turn the power back on at the company 's two main facilities there 
 that should happen by today he said 
 traders worked with the help of <unk> <unk> through windows despite large cracks in the walls and a lack of <unk> phone calls 
 also most of the telecommunications equipment was out 
 the traders were executing municipal bond mutual fund and other orders through a sister firm tucker anthony inc. which is also owned by john hancock freedom securities but is based in new york 
 we are having a regular day 
 volume is down out of san francisco but not out of the N <unk> offices mr. <unk> added 
 <unk> 's oakland office executed orders through the sacramento office which was n't affected by the quake 
 others like prudential-bache securities inc. which has eight offices in the san francisco area set up an N number yesterday morning for customers to obtain market commentary and other help 
 at kidder peabody & co. 's sacramento branch manager <unk> white received calls yesterday morning from workers in san francisco who offered to work in sacramento 
 then she discovered that quotron systems inc. 's sacramento lines were down because they are normally tied in through a system that goes through san francisco 
 so the kidder brokers had to call other company offices to get quotes on stocks 
 at quotron the company 's national <unk> center which swung into action for the first time last month for hurricane hugo assembled a tactical team at N a.m. yesterday to begin <unk> lines and restore service to brokers and traders 
 the company dispatched as many as N people in the san francisco area to do the work though most of the <unk> was done by computer 
 service appeared to be down throughout the financial district in downtown san francisco while just parts of oakland and san jose were knocked out 
 but dale irvine director of the emergency center said service was being restored to <unk> san francisco areas 
 in chicago yesterday options clearing confirmed that it guarantees the pacific exchange options 
 the firm also will permit its members and the public to exercise their put and call options contracts traded on the pacific exchange even if the exchange is closed said wayne <unk> chairman of options clearing 
 put options give holders the right but not the obligation to sell a financial instrument at a specified price while call options give holders the right but not the obligation to buy a financial instrument at a specified price 
 investors and traders in pacific exchange options are protected to the extent that they can convert their put and call options into the underlying instrument mr. <unk> said 
 we are seeing such exercises today in fact 
 international business machines corp. said its board approved the purchase of $ N billion of its common shares a move that should help support its battered stock 
 even as the stock market has generally done well this year ibm 's shares have slipped steadily from its 52-week high of $ N 
 yesterday 's closing price of $ N down N cents in composite trading on the new york stock exchange puts the stock at about N N times book value which is as low as it has <unk> over the past decade 
 the announcement came after the market 's close 
 the move by ibm was n't exactly a surprise 
 the company has spent some $ N billion over the past N N years to buy back N million common shares or roughly N N of those outstanding 
 in addition despite ibm 's <unk> recent problems the computer giant still generates enormous amounts of cash 
 as of the end of the second quarter it had $ N billion of cash and <unk> securities on hand 
 as a result some securities analysts had predicted in recent days that ibm would <unk> additional purchases 
 in armonk n.y. a spokesman said that although ibm did n't view its spending as necessarily a way to support the stock it thought the purchases were a good way to improve such financial measurements as per-share earnings and return on equity 
 we view it as a good long-term investment the spokesman said 
 in the short term the move is likely to have little effect 
 at yesterday 's closing price $ N billion would buy back about N million shares or less than N N of the roughly N million outstanding 
 in addition as of sept. N the company still had authorization to buy $ N million of stock under a prior repurchase program 
 over the long term however ibm 's stock <unk> along with its hefty $ <unk> annual dividend and generally loyal following among large institutional investors are providing a floor for the stock price 
 although ibm last year produced its first strong results in four years and was expected to continue to roll this year it began <unk> as early as january 
 first it had trouble manufacturing a chip for its mainframes ibm 's bread-and-butter business 
 then it had a series of smaller <unk> including problems manufacturing certain personal computers and the delay in the announcement of some important workstations 
 finally ibm had to delay the introduction of some high-end disk drives which account for N N of its $ N billion of annual revenue 
 none of the problems is necessarily fatal and they are n't all necessarily even related 
 there are also other factors at work that are outside ibm 's control such as currency exchange rates 
 the strong dollar which reduces the value of overseas earnings and revenue when they are translated into dollars is expected to knock N to N cents off ibm 's per-share earnings for the full year 
 without that problem ibm might have matched last year 's earnings of $ N billion or $ N a share 
 still investors will take some convincing before they get back into ibm 's stock in a big way 
 steve <unk> a securities analyst at first boston said that while investors were looking for an excuse to buy ibm shares a year ago even the big institutional investors are looking for a reason to avoid the stock these days 
 on wall street yesterday northern california 's killer earthquake was just another chance to make a buck 
 at the opening bell investors quickly began <unk> out shares of companies expected to profit or suffer in some way from the california disaster including insurers <unk> companies refiners and housing lenders

 wall street thinks of everything in terms of money says tom <unk> a senior oppenheimer & co. trader 
 however he added such <unk> trading moves typically last only a few hours and are often made without full information 
 the most popular plays of the day were insurance companies such as general <unk> corp. which rose $ N to $ N <unk> <unk> corp. up $ N to $ N american international group inc. up $ N to $ N and cigna corp. up N cents to $ N 
 yesterday the brokerage firm <unk> & co. said insurers will use the earthquake as an excuse to raise insurance rates ending their long price wars 
 before this bullish theory surfaced some insurance stocks initially fell indicating that investors thought the quake might cost insurers a lot of money 
 in fact fireman 's fund corp. which ended the day off N cents to $ N said earthquake damage would slightly hurt fourth-quarter profit 
 on the prospect for rebuilding northern california investors bid up <unk> <unk> co. up $ N to $ N and lone star industries inc. up $ N to $ N 
 bridge and road builders had a field day including <unk> corp. up $ N to $ N guy f. <unk> co. up N to $ N and morrison <unk> corp. which reported higher third-quarter earnings yesterday up $ N to $ N 
 fluor corp. a construction engineering firm gained N cents to $ N 
 but <unk> stocks were a mixed bag 
 <unk> stocks got a big boost 
 georgia pacific corp. up $ N to $ N and <unk> inc. up $ N to $ N both reported strong profits 
 merrill lynch & co. touted georgia-pacific louisiana pacific corp. and <unk> industries inc. as the best <unk> <unk> plays 
 other gainers were companies with one or more <unk> california refineries 
 <unk> corp. jumped $ N to $ N and chevron corp. despite a temporary pipeline shutdown rose $ N to $ N 
 meanwhile shares of some big housing lenders got hit on the likelihood that the lenders ' collateral people 's homes suffered physical damage and perhaps a loss in value 
 wells fargo & co. fell N cents to $ N and bankamerica corp. fell N cents to $ N 
 some california thrift stocks also fell including golden west financial corp. and h.f. ahmanson & co. which reported lower earnings yesterday 
 property values did n't go up in california yesterday says one money manager

 friday 's stock market plunge claimed its second victim among the scores of futures and options trading firms here 
 petco options an options trading firm owned by the family of the <unk> former chicago board of trade chairman ralph peters is getting out of the trade clearing or processing and <unk> business after <unk> a <unk> dollar loss friday options industry officials said 
 nearly N options traders on the chicago board options exchange who cleared trades through petco including a handful of traders who lost between $ N to $ N million themselves as a result of friday 's debacle are trying to transfer their business to other clearing firms cboe members said 
 timothy vincent petco chief executive officer confirmed that petco was <unk> from the clearing business 
 the owners of the company got a look at the potential risks in this business and after monday they felt they did n't want to be exposed any more he said 
 he added that petco remained in compliance with all industry capital requirements during the market 's rapid plunge friday and monday 's rebound 
 a cboe spokeswoman declined comment on petco 
 over the weekend fossett corp. another options trading firm transferred the clearing accounts of about N traders to first options of chicago a unit of continental bank corp. because it could n't meet regulatory capital requirements after friday 's market slide 
 the unprecedented transfer of accounts underscored the options industry 's desire not to have its credibility <unk> by potentially widespread trading defaults on monday 
 the cboe american stock exchange options clearing corp. and stephen fossett owner of fossett joined in putting up $ N million to guarantee the accounts at first options 
 the head of another small options clearing firm who asked not to be identified said that the heightened volatility in the financial markets in recent years makes it increasingly difficult for any but the largest financial trading firms to shoulder the risk inherent in the highly leveraged options and futures business 
 prior to the introduction of financial futures in the late 1970s most trading firms <unk> around the <unk> street financial district here were family operations handed down from one generation to the next 
 most also were relatively <unk> compared with the size of most wall street securities firms 
 mr. peters a <unk> street <unk> among the <unk> war ii generation of commodity traders was rumored to have <unk> a multimillion-dollar fortune from commodity trading and other activities by the time he died in may 
 part of a series 
 <unk> <unk> is a <unk> <unk> and <unk> in rural <unk> county n.j 
 but put her behind a shopping <unk> and she turns <unk> 
 if colgate <unk> offers a <unk> <unk> coupon she 'll cross crest off her shopping list without a second thought 
 never mind that her husband prefers crest 
 some weeks when her supermarket runs a <unk> promotion she boasts that she <unk> $ N off her bill 
 money is n't the only thing that makes her dump once favorite brands 
 after she heard about the <unk> hazards of <unk> oils in many <unk> she dropped <unk> farm and started buying brands free of such oils 
 i always thought <unk> farm was <unk> and high quality mrs. <unk> says 
 but i do n't want any of that oil for my <unk> 
 <unk> farm says it ca n't tell exactly how many customers it has lost but it hopes to remove the <unk> <unk> oil from all its products by year end 
 clearly people like mrs. <unk> are giving marketers fits 
 she represents a new breed of <unk> consumer who puts bargain prices nutritional and environmental concerns and other priorities ahead of old-fashioned brand loyalty 
 while brand loyalty is far from dead marketing experts say it has eroded during the 1980s 
 marketers themselves are partly to blame they 've increased spending for coupons and other short-term promotions at the expense of <unk> advertising 
 what 's more a flood of new products has given consumers a dizzying choice of brands many of which are virtually carbon copies of one other 
 marketers have brought this on themselves with their heavy use of promotions contends joe <unk> an executive vice president at the d'arcy <unk> benton & <unk> ad agency 
 without some real product improvements it 's going to be difficult to win that loyalty back 
 the wall street journal 's american way of buying survey this year found that most consumers switch brands for many of the products they use 
 for the survey peter d. hart research associates asked some N consumers including mrs. <unk> whether they usually buy one brand of a certain type of product or have no brand loyalty 
 more than half the users of N of the N products included in the survey said they 're brand <unk> 
 overall N N of consumers are n't brand loyal for any of the N product categories 
 about N N are loyal for one to five of the products 
 only N N are brand loyal in N to N of the categories and no one is loyal for more than N types of products 
 for such products as <unk> <unk> and athletic shoes <unk> to a single brand was quite low with fewer than N N saying they usually buy the same brand 
 only for cigarettes <unk> and <unk> did more than N N of users say they typically stick with the same brand 
 people tend to be most loyal to brands that have distinctive <unk> such as cigarettes and <unk> 
 <unk> <unk> a <unk> in the journal survey from <unk> wash. says her husband is <unk> about eating only hunt 's <unk> 
 he simply ca n't <unk> the taste of <unk> she says 
 the <unk> <unk> adds the only other thing i 'm really loyal to is my virginia <unk> cigarettes 
 coke and pepsi are all the same to me and i usually buy whichever brand of coffee happens to be on sale 
 brand <unk> plays a significant role in loyalty to such products as cigarettes <unk> and beer 
 people often stay with a particular brand because they want to be associated with the image its advertising <unk> whether that 's <unk> <unk> cigarettes or <unk> 's <unk> <unk> 
 loyalty <unk> most for <unk> products like trash bags and <unk> 
 only N N of <unk> users in the journal survey usually buy the same brand and just N N of battery buyers stick to one brand 
 underwear scored a <unk> N N in brand loyalty but consumer researchers say that 's actually quite high for such a mundane product 
 in the past you just wore fruit of the <unk> and did n't care says peter kim u.s. director of consumer behavior research for the j. walter thompson ad agency 
 the high score reflects the attempts to make underwear more of a fashion image business for both men and women 
 he believes there 's opportunity for a smart gasoline marketer to create a strong brand image and more consumer loyalty 
 what loyalty there is to gas brands he believes is a matter of <unk> at the most <unk> located service stations 
 brand loyalty was stronger among older consumers in the journal survey 
 nearly <unk> of participants age N and older claim brand loyalty for more than N of the N products in the survey only N N of those age N to N have such strong <unk> 
 <unk> people also tend to be more brand loyal these days the journal survey and other research studies indicate 
 marketers speculate that more affluent people tend to lead more pressured lives and do n't have time to research the products they buy for the highest quality and most reasonable price 
 an established brand name is insurance that at least the product will be of acceptable quality if not always the best value for the money 
 it 's sort of loyalty by default 
 meanwhile the bottom end of the market is becoming less loyal says laurel cutler vice chairman of the ad agency <unk> katz partners 
 they 're buying whatever 's cheaper 
 the biggest wild card in the brand loyalty game how those <unk> pursued but highly <unk> baby boomers will <unk> as they move into middle age 
 they grew up with more brand choices than any generation and have shown less <unk> so far 
 but now that they 're settling down and raising families might they also show more stability in their brand choices 
 mr. kim of j. walter thompson does n't think so 
 he believes baby boomers will continue to be selective in their brand <unk> 
 earlier generations were brand loyal across categories he says but boomers tend to be brand loyal in categories like running shoes and bottled water but less so in others like toilet paper and appliances 
 while not as brand loyal as in the past consumers today do n't buy products <unk> either 
 rather they tend to have a set of two or three <unk> 
 sometimes they 'll choose <unk> <unk> <unk> other times it will be <unk> 
 advertisers attribute this shared loyalty to the striking similarity among brands 
 if a more <unk> <unk> hits the market you can be sure a new and improved <unk> wo n't be far behind 
 the <unk> worldwide ad agency studied brand parity and found that consumers believe all brands are about the same in a number of categories particularly credit cards paper <unk> dry <unk> and <unk> chips 
 when there 's a clutter of brands consumers <unk> the <unk> by telling themselves all brands are the same so what difference does it make which i buy says karen <unk> a senior vice president at <unk> 
 too often advertising <unk> has n't done a good job of <unk> a special emotional bond between a brand and the consumer 
 but given such strong brand <unk> some marketers are putting renewed emphasis on image advertising 
 a small but growing number of companies are also trying to <unk> more <unk> brand loyalty through such <unk> <unk> <unk> as <unk> magazines and membership clubs for brand users 
 while discount promotions are essential for most brands some companies concede they went <unk> in shifting money from advertising to coupons refunds and other sales incentives 
 some people argue that strong brands can afford to stop advertising for a time because of the <unk> impact of hundreds of millions of dollars spent on advertising through the years 
 but most companies are too afraid to take that chance 
 and perhaps with good reason 
 says <unk> <unk> president of the d'arcy <unk> ad agency 's u.s. division every time N hours pass without any advertising reinforcement brand loyalty will <unk> ever so slightly even for a powerful brand like <unk> 
 consider for example what happened to maxwell house coffee 
 the kraft general foods brand stopped advertising for about a year in N and gave up several market share points and its leadership position in the coffee business 
 but since returning to advertising maxwell house has regained the lost share and is running neck and neck with archrival <unk> 
 now philip morris kraft general foods ' parent company is committed to the coffee business and to increased advertising for maxwell house says dick mayer president of the general foods usa division 
 even though brand loyalty is rather strong for coffee we need advertising to maintain and strengthen it 
 campbell soup co. for one has concluded that it makes good sense to focus more on its most loyal customers than on people who buy competitive brands 
 the probability of converting a <unk> to your brand is about three in N says tony adams the company 's vice president for marketing research 
 the best odds are with your core franchise 
 our heavy users consume two to three cans of soup a week and we 'd like to increase that 
 so campbell is talking to its brand enthusiasts probing their psychological <unk> to its soup 
 in one consumer focus group a fan declared that campbell 's soup is like getting a <unk> from a friend 
 that helped persuade the company to introduce a new advertising <unk> a warm <unk> from campbell 's 
 insurers face the prospect of paying out billions of dollars for damages caused by this week 's california earthquake 
 getting a grip on the extent of the damages is proving a far more difficult task than what insurers faced after hurricane hugo <unk> through the caribbean and the carolinas last month 
 the earthquake 's toll including possible deep structural damage goes far beyond the more easily observed damage from a hurricane says george <unk> a vice president in aetna life & casualty insurance co. 's claims division 
 but investors are betting that the financial and psychological impact of the earthquake coming so soon after the hurricane will help stem more than two years of intense <unk> wars among business insurers 
 reflecting that logic <unk> stocks posted strong gains 
 aetna and other insurers are hiring engineers and architects to help them assess structural damage 
 most insurers already have <unk> their catastrophe teams to begin processing claims from their policyholders in northern california 
 since commercial air travel is interrupted aetna based in hartford conn. chartered three planes to fly claims adjusters into sacramento and then planned for them to drive to the bay area 
 about N adjusters were dispatched yesterday afternoon along with laptop computers cellular phones and blank checks 
 some adjusters already in other parts of california drove to the disaster area with recreational vehicles and mobile homes that could be used as <unk> <unk> centers 
 insurers will be advertising N numbers probably on the radio that policyholders can call to get assistance on how to submit claims 
 state farm mutual automobile insurance co. the largest home and auto insurer in california believes the losses from the earthquake could be somewhat less than the $ N million in damages it expects to pay out for claims resulting from hurricane hugo 
 state farm based in <unk> ind. is also the largest writer of <unk> earthquake insurance in california 
 earthquake insurance is sold as a separate policy or a specific endorsement rider on a <unk> 's policy in california because of the area 's <unk> to earthquakes 
 state farm said about N N of its policyholders in california have also purchased earthquake insurance 
 <unk> insurance co. a unit of sears roebuck & co. said about N N of its personal property policyholders about N N in the san <unk> area also have earthquake coverage 
 the association of california insurance companies estimated damage to residential property could total $ N million but only $ N million to $ N million is insured it said 
 officials from the american insurance association 's <unk> service division which <unk> the efforts of the claims adjusters in an area after a natural disaster will be flying to san francisco today 
 they expect to have a preliminary estimate of the damages in a day or two 
 roads and bridges in the bay area appear to have suffered some of the most costly damage 
 highways such as the section of interstate N that collapsed in oakland generally do n't have insurance coverage 
 industry officials say the bay bridge unlike some bridges has no earthquake coverage either so the cost of <unk> it probably would have to be paid out of state general operating funds 
 however the bridge which charges a $ N toll each way does have loss of income insurance to replace lost revenue if the operation of the bridge is interrupted for more than seven days 
 that coverage is provided by a syndicate of insurance companies including fireman 's fund corp. based in <unk> calif. and cigna corp. based in philadelphia 
 earthquake-related claims are n't expected to cause significant financial problems for the insurance industry as a whole 
 instead even with the liabilities of two natural disasters in recent weeks analysts said the total capital of the industry is likely to be higher at year end than it was at midyear 
 indeed the earthquake could contribute to a turnaround in the insurance cycle in a couple of ways 
 for example insurers may seek to limit their future exposure to catastrophes by increasing the amount of reinsurance they buy 
 such increased demand for reinsurance along with the losses the <unk> will bear from these two disasters are likely to spur increases in reinsurance prices that will later be translated into an overall price rise 
 reinsurance is protection taken out by the insurance firms themselves 
 we are saying this is the breaking point this is the event that will change the psychology of the marketplace said william <unk> an analyst with <unk> & co. a hartford firm that specializes in the insurance industry 
 his firm along with some others issued new buy recommendations on insurer stocks yesterday 
 among the insurance stocks big gainers included american international group up $ N to $ N general <unk> corp. up $ N to $ N aetna up $ N to $ N and marsh & mclennan inc. up $ N to $ N 
 still a few individual companies most likely smaller ones could be <unk> 
 i think there is a <unk> good chance someone is going to hit the <unk> on this said oppenheimer & co. analyst <unk> <unk> 
 he suspects some insurers who had purchased reinsurance to limit their exposure to catastrophes will discover that reinsurance was used up by hurricane hugo 
 british west german <unk> and other overseas insurers are bracing for big claims from the san francisco earthquake disaster 
 although it 's unclear how much exposure the london market will face u.k. traditionally have a large reinsurance exposure to u.s. catastrophe coverage 
 jack <unk> chairman of fireman 's fund said this disaster will test the catastrophe reinsurance market causing these rates to soar 
 the catastrophe losses sustained by insurers this year will probably be the worst on an inflation-adjusted basis since N when another earthquake sparked the great san francisco fire 
 <unk> <unk> an insurance consultant in new york estimates that the N san francisco destruction on an inflation-adjusted basis included insured losses of $ N billion 
 he is estimating this week 's disaster will generate insured losses of $ N billion to $ N billion following about $ N billion in costs to insurers from hurricane hugo 
 silicon graphics inc. 's first-quarter profit rose sharply to $ N million or N cents a share from $ N million or six cents a share a year ago

 hunter environmental services inc. said it reached a preliminary accord on the sale of its environmental consulting and services business for about $ N million and assumption of related debt 
 the buyer was n't identified 
 the company said it also is making progress in negotiating the buy-out of its design division by management 
 in addition hunter said it will use proceeds from a private placement of $ N million of preferred shares to purchase an interest in a start-up company to underwrite environmental <unk> insurance 
 hunter wants to concentrate its resources on the insurance business and on a project to store hazardous <unk> in salt <unk>

 sir john <unk> told reporters at london 's <unk> yesterday he would be disappointed if we could n't do the deal within a month 
 he said the <unk> would mean jaguar could develop cars down range in price from where we are by offering access to gm 's <unk> parts production 
 besides creating joint manufacturing ventures the accord is expected to give gm about a N N stake that eventually would rise to about N N 
 jaguar figures a friendly alliance with gm will fend off unwelcome advances from ford motor co 
 but ford jaguar 's biggest shareholder since lifting its stake to N N this week is pressing harder for talks with sir john 
 we 're getting to the point where we are going to have to meet with him one ford official said yesterday 
 ford probably will renew its request for such a meeting soon he added 
 sir john has <unk> ford 's advances since the u.s. auto giant launched a surprise bid for as much as N N of jaguar last month 
 ford has signaled it might acquire a majority interest later 
 i 'm not obligated to sit down and talk to anybody the jaguar chairman asserted yesterday 
 he did n't rule out negotiations with ford however 
 the fiercely proud but financially strapped british company prefers to remain independent and publicly held despite ford 's promise of access to cash and technological know-how 
 sir john noted that gm a longtime jaguar supplier agrees we should remain an independent company 
 he said jaguar started negotiating with gm and several other car makers over a year ago but the rest dropped by the <unk> ever since the share price went above # N $ N a share 
 jaguar shares stood at N pence before ford 's initial announcement but the subsequent takeover frenzy has driven them up 
 the stock traded late yesterday on london 's stock exchange at N pence up N pence 
 developing an <unk> range would mark a major departure for britain 's leading luxury-car maker 
 a typical british executive car is mass produced and smaller than a luxury car 
 it generally <unk> no more than # N $ N roughly # N less than the <unk> <unk> which are all known for their <unk> leather work 
 we have designs for such executive cars but have never been able to develop them sir john said 
 gm 's help would make it possible for jaguar to build a wider range of cars 
 an executive model would significantly boost jaguar 's yearly output of N cars 
 you are talking about a couple hundred thousand a year said bob barber an <unk> analyst at u.k. brokerage james capel & co 
 a pact with gm may emerge in as little as two weeks according to sources close to the talks 
 the deal would require approval by a majority of jaguar shareholders 
 we have to make it attractive enough that holders would accept it sir john said 
 that may be difficult the jaguar chairman acknowledged when you have somebody else breathing down your neck 
 ford probably would try to kill the proposal by <unk> support from u.s. takeover-stock speculators and holding out the <unk> of a larger bid later said stephen reitman european auto analyst at london brokers <unk> phillips & drew 
 ford ca n't make a <unk> bid for jaguar until u.k. government restrictions expire 
 the anti-takeover measure prevents any outside investor from buying more than N N of jaguar shares without permission until dec. N N 
 but with its N N stake ford can <unk> a special jaguar shareholders ' meeting and urge them to drop the restrictions <unk> 
 it 's a very valuable weapon in their <unk> which could enable ford to bid sooner for jaguar observed mr. barber of james capel 
 otherwise jaguar may have to <unk> the two u.s. auto giants each owning a N N stake for more than a year 
 it would be difficult to see how a car company can be owned by a collective sir john said 
 it has never been done before but there 's always a first 
 although two baby bells showed strong growth in access lines usage and <unk> business revenue one reported a modest gain in third-quarter net while the other posted a small drop 
 <unk> corp. 's earnings increased N N after strong revenue gains were offset somewhat by refunds and rate reductions imposed by regulators in its midwest territory 
 bellsouth corp. 's third-quarter earnings dropped N N as a result of debt refinancing the recent acquisition of a cellular and <unk> property and rate reductions in its southeast territory 
 bellsouth

 total operating expenses increased N N to $ N billion from $ N billion 
 overall access minutes of use increased N N and toll messages jumped N N 
 bellsouth chairman and chief executive officer john l. <unk> said three factors accounted for the drop in third-quarter earnings 
 the refinancing of $ N million in long-term debt reduced net income by $ N million or five cents a share but in the long run will save more than $ N million in interest costs 
 the company previously said that the recent acquisition of mobile communications corp. of america would <unk> N earnings by about N N

 the wall street journal american way of buying survey consists of two separate <unk> nationwide polls conducted for the journal by peter d. hart research associates and the roper organization 
 the two surveys which asked different questions were conducted using national random probability samples 
 the poll conducted by peter d. hart research associates interviewed N adults age N and older from june N to june N N 
 the poll conducted by the roper organization interviewed N adults age N and older from july N to july N N 
 responses were weighted on the basis of age and <unk> to conform with u.s. census data 
 for each poll the odds are N out of N that if <unk> had sought to survey every household in the u.s. using the same <unk> the findings would differ from these poll results by no more than N N percentage points in either direction 
 the margin of error for <unk> for example married women with children at home would be larger 
 in addition in any survey there is always the chance that other factors such as question <unk> could introduce errors into the findings 
 program traders were buying and selling at full steam monday the first trading session after the stock market 's 190.58-point plunge friday 
 they accounted for a hefty N N of new york stock exchange volume monday the fourth busiest session ever 
 on friday N N of volume was in computer-guided program trades 
 in august by contrast program trading averaged N N of daily big board turnover 
 program traders were publicly <unk> following the <unk> crash oct. N N and a number of brokerage firms pulled back from using this strategy for a while 
 but as the outcry faded by the spring of N they resumed 
 some observers thought that after friday 's sharp drop the firms would rein in their program traders to avoid <unk> more controversy 
 but the statistics released yesterday show the firms did nothing of the sort 
 one reason they said was that the official reports on the N crash <unk> program trading as a cause 
 stock-index arbitrage is the most controversial form of program trading because it <unk> market moves if not actually causing them 
 in it traders buy or sell stocks and offset those positions in stock-index futures contracts to profit from fleeting price discrepancies 
 under the exchange 's <unk> program trading also describes a number of other strategies that in the opinion of some traders do n't cause big swings in the market 
 the big board 's disclosure of program trading activity on these two days was unusual 
 though it <unk> such data daily its monthly reports on program trading usually come out about three weeks after each month ends 
 the september figures are due to be released this week 
 the big board declined to name the wall street firms involved in the activity friday and monday or the type of strategies used 
 but traders on the exchange floor who can <unk> the computer-guided trading activity on monitor screens said most of the top program-trading firms were active both days 
 through august the top five program trading firms in volume were morgan stanley & co. kidder peabody & co. merrill lynch & co. painewebber group inc. and salomon brothers inc 
 though brokerage officials defended their use of program trading one sign of what an issue it remains was that few executives would comment on the record 
 besides <unk> the <unk> for program trading contained in the brady commission report they said stock-index arbitrage was actually needed monday to restore the markets ' <unk> 
 on friday the stock-index futures market was <unk> from the stock market when the chicago mercantile exchange halted trading in standard & poor 's N futures contract a circuit breaker procedure instituted after the N crash and implemented for the first time 
 futures trading resumed a half-hour later but the session ended shortly thereafter leaving the stock market set up for more sell programs traders said 
 by monday morning they said stock-index arbitrage sell programs helped <unk> the link between stocks and futures 
 but stunning volatility was produced in the process 
 the dow jones industrial average plunged a <unk> N points in the first N minutes of trading monday as stock-index arbitrage sell programs kicked in 
 at about N a.m. edt the market abruptly turned upward on stock-index arbitrage buy programs 
 by day 's end the dow industrials had rebounded N points or nearly half of friday 's drop 
 frederick 's of hollywood inc. los angeles said its board voted a N N increase in the specialty <unk> operator 's semiannual dividend to five cents a common share 
 the dividend is payable dec. N to stock of record nov. N 
 valley national corp. reported a third-quarter net loss of $ N million or $ N a share and suspended its quarterly dividend because of potential losses on its arizona real estate holdings 
 the <unk> holding company for arizona 's largest bank said it added $ N million to its allowance for losses on loans and for real estate owned 
 the company earned $ N million or N cents a share a year earlier 
 for the nine months valley national posted a net loss of $ N million or $ N a share 
 it had profit of $ N million or $ N a share in the N period 
 valley national had been paying a quarterly dividend of N cents a share 
 the arizona real estate market continues to be depressed and there is still uncertainty as to when values will recover james p. simmons chairman said 
 the decision to increase the loan-loss reserve and suspend the dividend is both prudent and in the best long-term interest of the shareholders he said 
 valley national said it made the decision on the basis of an overall assessment of the marketplace and the condition of its loan portfolio and after reviewing it with federal regulators 
 the addition to reserves comes on top of a provision of $ N million that was announced in june 
 in july moody 's downgraded $ N million of the company 's debt saying the bank holding company had n't taken adequate write-offs against potential losses on real estate loans despite its second-quarter write-down 
 richard m. <unk> valley national 's executive vice president said then that the company believed the write-downs were adequate and did n't plan to increase its reserves again 
 bruce <unk> a banking analyst with <unk> & co. a denver brokerage firm said valley national is n't out of the woods yet 
 the key will be whether arizona real estate turns around or at least <unk> he said 
 they 've stepped up to the plate to take the write-downs but when markets head down a company is always exposed to further negative surprises mr. <unk> said 
 valley national closed yesterday at $ N a share down $ N in national over-the-counter trading 
 two years of <unk> down the drain 
 that 's the way a lot of brokers feel today on the second anniversary of the N stock-market crash 
 ever since that fearful black monday they 've been <unk> wooing wary individual investors trying to convince them that oct. N N was a <unk> and that the stock market really is a safe place for average americans to put their <unk> dollars 
 and until last friday it seemed those efforts were starting to pay off 
 some of those folks were coming back says leslie quick jr. chairman of discount brokers quick & <unk> group inc 
 we had heard from people who had n't been active for a long time 
 then came the <unk> 190-point plunge in the dow jones industrial average and a new wave of stock-market volatility 
 all of a sudden it was back to square one 
 it 's going to set things back for a period because it <unk> the concern of volatility says jeffrey b. lane president of shearson lehman hutton inc 
 i think it will shake confidence one more time and a lot of this business is based on client confidence 
 brokers around the country say the reaction from individual investors this week has been almost <unk> 
 customers and potential customers are suddenly complaining about the stock market in the exact way they did in post-crash N 
 the kinds of questions you had before have <unk> says raymond a. chip mason chairman of regional brokerage firm legg mason inc. baltimore 
 i can just tell the questions are right back where they were what 's going on ca n't anything be done about program trading does n't the exchange understand where is the sec on this 
 mr. mason says he 's convinced the public still wants to invest in common stocks even though they believe the deck is <unk> against them 
 but these wide swings scare them to death 
 all of this is bad news for the big brokerage firms such as shearson and merrill lynch & co. that have big retail or <unk> businesses 
 after expanding rapidly during the <unk> years up to the N crash retail brokerage operations these days are getting barely enough business to pay the overhead 
 true the amount of money investors are willing to <unk> to their brokers has been growing lately 
 but those dollars have been going into such safe products as money market funds which do n't generate much in the way of commissions for the brokerage firms 
 at discount brokerage charles schwab & co. such <unk> investments recently accounted for a record $ N billion of the firm 's $ N billion of client 's assets 
 the brokers ' hope has been that they could soon <unk> investors into shifting some of their <unk> into the stock market 
 and before last friday they were actually making modest progress 
 a slightly higher percentage of new york stock exchange volume has been attributed to retail investors in recent months compared with post-crash N according to securities industry association data 
 in N an average N N of big board volume was retail business with the monthly level never more than N N 
 the retail participation dropped to an average N N in N and <unk> to barely N N some months during the year 
 yet in N retail participation has been more than N N in every month and was N N in august the latest month for which figures are available 
 jeffrey <unk> the <unk> 's research director says that all of his group 's <unk> statistics could be <unk> by as much as five percentage points because corporate <unk> are sometimes <unk> included in big board data 
 but there did seem to be a retail activity pickup 
 but friday did n't help things says mr. <unk> 
 with the gyrations of recent days says hugo <unk> senior vice president at charles schwab many small investors are absolutely convinced that they should n't play in the stock market 
 joseph <unk> president of retail sales and marketing at painewebber group inc. still thinks that individual investors will eventually go back into the stock market 
 investors will develop <unk> <unk> and their confidence will return he says 
 friday 's plunge he is telling painewebber brokers was nothing more than a tremendous reaction to leveraged buy-out stocks 
 meanwhile painewebber remains among the leaders in efforts to simply persuade investors to keep giving wall street their money 
 it 's more of an important issue to keep control of those assets rather than push the investor to move into specific products such as equities mr. <unk> says 
 the equity decision will come when the client is ready and when there 's a <unk> of confidence 
 it could be a long wait say some industry observers 
 some investors will <unk> back in says richard ross a market research director for <unk> & <unk> in chicago 
 then there 'll be another swing 
 given enough of these this will drive everyone out except the most <unk> he adds 
 mr. ross who has been studying retail investors ' perception of risks in the brokerage industry said a market plunge like friday 's <unk> investors ' confidence in their ability to make any judgments on the market 
 the long-term outlook for the retail brokerage business is <unk> mr. ross declares

 senate republicans have settled on a proposal that would cut the capital-gains tax for individuals and corporations 
 at the same time a small group of senate democrats are working on a similar plan and may introduce it soon 
 sen. bob packwood r. ore. the lead sponsor of the gop proposal said he intends to unveil the plan today and to offer it as an amendment to whatever legislation comes along particularly this month 's bill to raise the federal borrowing limit 
 he gave <unk> odds that a capital-gains tax cut of some sort would be approved this year though it probably wo n't be included in the pending deficit-reduction bill 
 he added that he expects to talk to the democrats who also wanted to cut the gains tax about <unk> a joint proposal 
 for individuals the packwood plan would exclude from income N N of the gain from the sale of a capital asset held for more than one year 
 the exclusion would rise five percentage points for each year the asset was held until it reached a maximum of N N 
 the exclusion would apply to assets sold after oct. N N 
 as an alternative he said taxpayers could chose to reduce their gains by an inflation index 
 for corporations the top tax rate on the sale of assets held for more than three years would be cut to N N from the current top rate of N N 
 that rate would gradually decline to as little as N N for corporate assets held for N years 
 the packwood plan would also include a proposal designed by sen. william roth r. del. that would expand and alter the deduction for individual retirement accounts 
 the roth plan would create a new <unk> ira from which money could be withdrawn tax-free not only for retirement but also for the purchase of a first home and to pay education and medical expenses 
 current iras could be rolled over into the new iras but would be subject to tax 
 for their part the group of democrats are working on a plan that like the packwood proposal would grant larger <unk> to assets the longer they were held by individuals and companies 
 newly acquired assets would get a bigger break than those currently held 
 an extra exclusion would be given to <unk> stock in small and <unk> corporations just starting up 
 no one in the senate is considering the capital-gains plan passed by the house 
 that plan would provide a N N exclusion to assets sold over a N 1\/2-year period ending dec. N N 
 after then the house measure would boost the tax rate to N N and exclude from tax the gain attributable to inflation 
 senators are focusing on making a capital-gains <unk> permanent 
 separately chairman dan <unk> d. ill of the house ways and means committee said he did n't want the capital-gains tax cut or any other amendments attached to the pending bill raising the federal borrowing limit 
 the current debt limit expires oct. N 
 he also urged house and senate negotiators to rid the deficit-reduction bill of all provisions that increase the budget deficit including the house-passed capital-gains provision 
 from a helicopter a thousand feet above oakland after the <unk> earthquake in u.s. history a scene of devastation emerges a freeway <unk> into a concrete <unk> <unk> pumping water into <unk> apartments abandoned autos 
 but this quake was n't the big one the <unk> of N that has been feared for so many years 
 despite the <unk> loss of more than N lives and damage estimated in the billions most businesses and their plants and offices in the bay area were n't greatly affected 
 the economic life of the region is expected to revive in a day or two although some transportation problems may last weeks or months 
 a main factor <unk> more widespread damage was the location of the quake 's epicenter N miles from the heart of the silicon valley and more than N miles from downtown san francisco and oakland 
 also the region 's insistence on strict building codes helped prevent wider damage 
 the tremendous energy of the quake was <unk> by the distance so that most parts of the valley and the major cities suffered largely cosmetic damage broken windows falling brick and <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> 
 of course the quake was the worst since the emergence of the computer era turned silicon valley into the nation 's capital of high technology 
 like other major american cities the san francisco oakland area owes its current prosperity more to its infrastructure of <unk> <unk> linking thousands of computer terminals and telephones than to its location <unk> one of the world 's great natural harbors 
 when the tremors struck the region 's largely <unk> high-tech fabric held up surprisingly well despite the devastation visible from the air 
 michael l. <unk> vice president for network technology at pacific bell telephone co. says nearly all the network 's computer switches which move thousands of calls a minute from one location to another changed to battery power when the city lost power 
 the battery <unk> have enough power for only three hours but that gave emergency crews time to turn on an emergency system that runs primarily on diesel fuel 
 of some N switches in pacific bell 's network only four went down 
 one of those was in <unk> calif. near the earthquake 's epicenter 
 few telephone lines snapped 
 that 's because the widely used <unk> cable has been installed underground with N extra feet of cable between <unk> points 
 the slack <unk> the pulling strain generated by an earthquake 
 nevertheless phone service was sporadic many computer terminals remained dark and by late yesterday a third of san francisco remained without power 
 business in the nation 's <unk> metropolitan region was nearly <unk> an estimated one million members of the work force stayed at home 
 the economic <unk> was as abrupt as the earthquake itself as virtually all businesses shut down 
 the $ <unk> bay area economy represents <unk> of the economy of the nation 's most <unk> state and accounts for N N to N N of the nation 's total output of goods and services according to the center for continuing study of the california economy in palo alto 
 in high-tech the bay area accounts for N N to N N of the u.s. <unk> industry 
 this has been a major disruption for the bay area economy says <unk> <unk> the chief economist at the california department of finance 
 obviously things are going to have to go on hold for many companies 
 the damage to the bay area 's roadways could cause significant economic <unk> 
 a quarter of a million people cross the bay bridge every day far more than the N that use the bay area rapid transit system bart which was working but was n't <unk> in the city 's financial district yesterday afternoon because electricity was shut off and the area was being <unk> for gas leaks 
 california state transportation officials interviewed by telephone say they nevertheless do n't expect serious problems for commerce in and out of the bay area 
 all major roadways except interstate N known as the nimitz freeway and the bay bridge were open by N p.m. yesterday 
 officials expect difficulty <unk> traffic through downtown san francisco 
 the earthquake caused many streets to buckle and crack making them <unk> 
 other roads were <unk> by collapsed buildings and damaged water and power lines an emergency relief spokesman says 
 san francisco mayor art agnos estimated the damage to his city alone at $ N billion 
 but many predicted that the commercial disruption would be short-lived 
 of the scores of companies contacted by this newspaper few reported any damage that they did n't expect to have <unk> within a day or two 
 it is possible of course that some of the most seriously damaged companies could n't be reached particularly in areas <unk> the epicenter 
 typical perhaps was the situation at new united motor manufacturing inc. the general motors <unk> joint-venture auto plant in <unk> about N miles south of oakland 
 ten of the plant 's workers were injured when the quake hit about a half-hour into the afternoon shift seven were <unk> 
 metal <unk> on the plant floor fell over and water <unk> <unk> a spokeswoman says 
 the plant was <unk> and workers sent home 
 but the plant was able to resume limited production of its toyota <unk> and <unk> <unk> by N a.m. yesterday and <unk> was only N N of the work force about twice normal 
 computer maker hewlett-packard co. based in palo alto says one of its buildings sustained severe damage when it was knocked off its foundation 
 other buildings had broken glass <unk> light <unk> and broken pipes a <unk> says estimating the cost of <unk> in the millions 
 most banks were closed but were expected to reopen today with few problems anticipated 
 at the federal reserve bank of san francisco vice president robert <unk> says operations were <unk> along as usual yesterday afternoon 
 when the quake hit we turned on our emergency <unk> and brought our computers up he says 
 the fed serves as a <unk> for banks taking checks from one bank and sending them to another an operation that it handled smoothly tuesday night after the quake 
 the volume we received from the banks was a lot lower than usual he says 
 a <unk> plan in which the los angeles fed would come to san francisco 's aid was n't needed he adds 
 most of the telephone problems in the immediate aftermath stemmed from <unk> 
 the telephone network simply could n't handle the large number of people seeking to make a call at the same time 
 the volume resulted in <unk> delays that were as short as N seconds and as long as five minutes 
 mr. <unk> puts traffic volume at N to N times normal 
 american telephone & telegraph co. mci communications inc. and united telecommunications ' u s <unk> unit were blocking phone calls into the bay area to alleviate <unk> 
 the companies block traffic much as highway <unk> are blocked when traffic backs up 
 william e. <unk> pacific bell 's vice president of customer services for the bay area says most long-distance companies were blocking about N N of all calls 
 pacific telesis says its pacific bell unit also was blocking about N N of its calls locally 
 ironically the long-term effect of the earthquake may be to bolster the bay area 's economic fortunes and indeed the nation 's gross national product 
 it may also lead to new <unk> in major construction projects such as <unk> highways 
 it would in the near-term give a boost to the san francisco economy because there will be an influx of people to help says beth burnham <unk> a regional economist at <unk> hill a lexington mass. forecasting firm 
 the construction industry is sure to feel increased demand 
 there will be a big influx of federal dollars and gains in state federal and local employment ms. <unk> says 
 adds <unk> <unk> an economist at georgia state university there 's nothing positive about an earthquake but it will probably generate more construction activity 
 wall street reacted swiftly yesterday to the disaster by bidding up stocks of construction and related companies 
 shares of lone star industries inc. a cement maker rose sharply in anticipation of <unk> demand 
 in greenwich conn. lone star spokesman michael london says obviously with an earthquake of this size there are likely to be construction projects that would n't otherwise have been anticipated 
 but any increase is n't likely to be any kind of a surge 
 it 's something likely to be spread out over a long period of time 
 there will be a lot of repair work that wo n't require the quantities of cement or concrete that new <unk> would 
 lone star 's san francisco facilities were n't damaged in the quake 
 the earthquake is likely to reduce gnp <unk> in the near term and then could raise it a bit as rebuilding begins 
 the first effects are of course negative as work is disrupted and people lose income and cut spending 
 corporate profits may also dip initially 
 many of the lost tourism dollars wo n't be recovered many trips delayed never take place 
 subsequently however the ill effects are likely to be offset at least in economic terms as construction activity begins 
 because of the way the government keeps its books the damage to the bay bridge however costly wo n't be counted as a minus

 it 's very difficult to model the long-term impact of this says andrew goldberg who studies the <unk> and <unk> aspects of earthquakes at the center for strategic international studies in washington <unk> 
 you certainly can say it 's going to be extremely severe 
 we really are talking about <unk> down a major american city for a number of days maybe for a few weeks 
 mr. goldberg says the cost of the earthquake will definitely top $ N billion and could reach $ N billion 
 he <unk> that early damage estimates are often low the damage totals in hurricane hugo increased tenfold as more information was received 
 the earthquake damage of course would have been far greater if the epicenter had been in downtown san francisco 
 a direct hit on a major city mr. goldberg figures would cause $ N billion to $ N billion of damage 
 experts caution that it is far too soon for <unk> estimates of the quake 's total damage but it 's clear that insurers are likely to pay out enormous sums 
 jack <unk> the chairman of fireman 's fund corp. which is based in <unk> calif. estimates insured losses resulting the earthquake could total $ N billion 
 the impact on the insurance industry will be big and harsh but less than hurricane hugo says mr. <unk> who <unk> the bay area by car yesterday afternoon to get a sense of the company 's exposure to the earthquake 
 mr. <unk> says fireman 's fund will probably pay hundreds of millions in primary claims but after taxes and use of its reinsurance lines the company 's <unk> charge against earnings should n't top $ N million 
 the company was able to assess its damage liability quickly because it has computerized <unk> of northern california showing the exact locations of all the property it <unk> 
 fireman 's fund had claims adjusters on the streets of san francisco right after <unk> yesterday and was paying as many claims as it could right on the spot 
 fireman 's fund <unk> N homes and autos and N businesses in the bay area 
 in addition to paying for earthquake and fire damage the insurer must cover <unk> claims and also losses due to businesses being shut down by lack of power or phone service 
 but many californians may not have adequate insurance coverage to pay for damages to their property 
 the independent insurance agents of america says fewer than one of every five california homeowners has earthquake insurance 
 a somewhat higher percentage of people living in the bay area have bought the additional insurance protection but the great majority are n't covered 
 earthquake insurance typically runs $ N or more a year for a small house

 the berlin wall still stands 
 but the man who built it has fallen 
 east germany yesterday removed erich honecker one of the <unk> <unk> against the reform <unk> through the communist world in an effort to win back the confidence of its increasingly <unk> citizens 
 but while it was a move that stunned the east bloc it hardly <unk> in an era of reform at least anytime soon 
 for the politburo replaced mr. honecker who had led east germany for N years and before that headed its security <unk> with a man cut of the same <unk> egon krenz the most recent <unk> chief and a longtime honecker <unk> 
 east germany it is clear is no poland where the communist party now shares power with the <unk> elected solidarity union 
 nor is it a hungary where yesterday the parliament approved constitutional changes meant to help turn the communist nation into a <unk> democracy 
 still any change in east germany has enormous implications for both east and west 
 it raises the <unk> hopes of many germans for reunification a prospect that almost equally <unk> political leaders in moscow washington and western europe 
 mr. krenz N was named the new party chief just minutes after the party 's <unk> central committee <unk> in east berlin 
 although the east german news agency <unk> claimed mr. honecker had asked to be relieved of his duties for health reasons west german government sources said the <unk> politburo had asked for his resignation at a separate meeting late tuesday 
 mr. honecker was twice <unk> this summer for a <unk> <unk> <unk> and his physical condition has been the subject of intense speculation in the western media 
 <unk> said mr. honecker a hard-line <unk> who in N <unk> the construction of the berlin wall also was relieved of his title as head of state and his position as chief of the military 
 mr. krenz is expected to be formally named to all three positions once the nation 's parliament <unk> later this week 
 mr. honecker 's <unk> fall <unk> nearly two decades of <unk> leadership during which mr. honecker now N years old built east germany into the most economically advanced nation in the soviet bloc 
 his grip on power unraveled this summer as thousands of his <unk> <unk> by the <unk> of his rule fled to the west 
 thousands more have taken to the streets in the last month in east germany 's largest wave of domestic unrest since a workers ' <unk> in N 
 in washington the bush administration took a <unk> cautious and skeptical view of the leadership change 
 the official line was to offer <unk> ties to mr. krenz provided he is willing to institute reforms 
 but u.s. officials have strong doubts that he is a <unk> 
 president bush told reporters whether that the leadership change reflects a change in <unk> relations i do n't think so 
 because mr. krenz has been very much in accord with the policies of honecker 
 one top u.s. expert on east germany added there is no <unk> champion of reform that we know of in the east german leadership 
 indeed mr. krenz said on east german television last night that there will be no sharing of power with pro-democracy groups 
 he said while dialogue is important enough <unk> already exist in which different interests can express themselves 
 the removal of mr. honecker was apparently the result of bitter <unk> within the top ranks of the communist party 
 according to west german government sources mr. honecker and several senior politburo members fought over the last week to delay any decisions about a leadership change 
 but with public demonstrations in the country growing in size and intensity mr. honecker and several key allies lost out in this battle officials say 
 those allies included politburo members <unk> <unk> who has long headed economic affairs and <unk> <unk> chief of information policy 
 both men were also relieved of their duties yesterday 
 although other resignations may follow it 's still not clear to what extent the change in party personnel will alter the government 's resistance to fundamental change 
 clearly the central figure in this process is egon krenz 
 born in N in a <unk> sea town now part of poland he was eight years old when world war ii ended 
 like west german chancellor helmut kohl he represents the postwar generation that has grown up during germany 's division 
 since joining the politburo in N as its youngest member mr. krenz had acquired the <unk> crown prince a reference to the widely held view that he was the <unk> successor to mr. honecker 
 in fact the two men have had <unk> similar career <unk> both having served as chief of internal security before their rise to the top party position 
 moreover both men have <unk> to a similar hard-line philosophy 
 notably one of mr. krenz 's few official visits overseas came a few months ago when he visited china after the massacre in beijing 
 he later defended the chinese government 's response during a separate visit to west germany 
 east german <unk> in particular fears mr. krenz in part because of an incident in january N when he was believed to have ordered the arrest of hundreds of <unk> who had sought refuge in the church 
 however mr. krenz also has a reputation for being politically <unk> 
 his <unk> ability to read the shifting popular mood in east germany is best illustrated by his apparent break with his old <unk> mr. honecker 
 indeed according to west german government sources he was one of the leaders in the power struggle that <unk> mr. honecker 
 in recent days mr. krenz has sought to project a <unk> image 
 according to a report widely circulating in east berlin it was mr. krenz who ordered police to stop using excessive force against demonstrators in leipzig 
 he does n't want to have the image of the gun man says fred <unk> an expert at the <unk> institute of east european and international studies in <unk> 
 he 's not a <unk> he wants to have the image of a <unk> 
 as part of his image <unk> mr. krenz is expected to take modest steps toward reform to rebuild confidence among the people and <unk> the party 's authority 
 besides <unk> other senior politburo officials who allied themselves with mr. honecker mr. krenz could loosen controls on the news media free up travel restrictions and establish a dialogue with various dissident groups 
 but will it be enough 
 west german government officials and western analysts are doubtful 
 he does n't <unk> what people want so the unrest will go on mr. <unk> predicts 
 at the same time the expectations of the east german people are great and will continue to grow 
 says one west german official what 's necessary now is the process of <unk> 
 not just that people are being heard but that their interests are being taken seriously 
 chancellor kohl meanwhile has invited mr. krenz to open discussions with bonn on a wide range of subjects 
 reports in the west german press citing sources in east germany suggest mr. krenz may serve only as a bridge between mr. honecker and a genuine reform leader 
 adding to that speculation is mr. krenz 's reputation as a heavy <unk> who is said to also suffer from <unk> 
 this is a dynamic process and we 're experiencing the first step the bonn official adds 
 the selection of mr. krenz may also <unk> moscow 
 soviet leader mikhail gorbachev has pressed hard for a change in east germany 's rigid stance 
 two <unk> party leaders favored by moscow as possible <unk> to mr. honecker <unk> party secretary <unk> <unk> and politburo member <unk> <unk> were passed over 
 if mr. krenz <unk> to rigid policies the pressure from the soviet union could intensify 
 in moscow mr. gorbachev sent mr. krenz a <unk> <unk> that appeared to urge the new leadership to <unk> growing calls for change 
 according to the soviet news agency tass gorbachev expressed the conviction that the leadership of the socialist unity party of east germany being sensitive to the demands of the time will find solutions to complicated problems the <unk> german democratic republic encountered 
 a force of younger <unk> members in the east german bureaucracy has for some time been pushing for <unk> within their country 
 the older generation has been torn between a fear of <unk> with the status <unk> and a fear of what might happen if they did n't 
 from the perspective of east germany 's old guard reforms that <unk> of capitalism and western-style democracy could eliminate their country 's reason for being 
 unlike the other nations of the bloc east germany is a <unk> of the cold war 
 <unk> the differences still <unk> europe and the vast international <unk> that implies wo n't endanger the <unk> of a poland or a hungary 
 but it could ultimately lead to german reunification and the disappearance of east germany from the <unk> 
 which is what the old guard fears 
 i 'm sure they 'll <unk> a reform that will be a <unk> for the <unk> 's future as a separately <unk> state says michael simmons a british journalist whose book on east germany entitled the <unk> country was published this month 
 up to now that <unk> has <unk> of a dogged effort by former leader walter <unk> to establish the country 's international legitimacy followed by mr. honecker 's campaign to build the east bloc 's only successful <unk> economy into a consumer <unk> 
 neither man achieved <unk> 
 early in N mr. honecker and his team stopped paying thin <unk> to mr. gorbachev and joined with <unk> in rejecting any necessity for adjustments in their systems 
 the <unk> <unk> and <unk> in contrast declared their intentions to reform while doing nothing concrete about it 
 the east german media soon began <unk> mr. gorbachev 's <unk> only as <unk> <unk> and giving space to his opponents 
 by late N they were banning soviet publications 
 the country abandoned its former <unk> to socialist unity and took to insisting instead that each country in the bloc ought to travel its own road 
 mr. honecker spoke of generally valid objective laws of socialism and left no room for debate 
 with this year 's <unk> in china and the soviet union and the drive to democracy in poland and hungary the east german leadership grew still more defensive 
 politburo member <unk> <unk> confessed to a grave concern over <unk> democracy 
 under the <unk> that <unk> the renewal of socialism he said forces are at work that are <unk> to eliminate socialism 
 some loyal voices in and out of the east german communist party saw the nation 's unrest coming 
 the first signs were economic 
 despite heavily subsidized consumer industries east germans have for years watched the west pull <unk> out ahead 
 in N for the first time economic growth came to a dead stop 
 <unk> some economists began to blame central planning 
 some writers in theoretical <unk> even raised the notion of introducing democracy at least in the workplace 
 by summer an independent reform movement was saying out loud what it had only <unk> before 
 but they are <unk> <unk> 
 their proclaimed purpose is to <unk> east germany of its <unk> <unk> not to merge with the west 
 one of their <unk> has <unk> a new <unk> of creative socialism 
 meanwhile the man mr. krenz <unk> has left an <unk> mark on east german society 
 <unk> by the <unk> during world war ii for his political <unk> mr. honecker <unk> the postwar generation of committed communist leaders in eastern europe who took their <unk> from moscow 
 he was a socialist <unk> who felt <unk> by west germany 's enormous postwar prosperity and the bonn government 's <unk> refusal to recognize the legitimacy of his state 
 finally during his first and only state visit to bonn two years ago he won some measure of the recognition he had long sought 
 but ultimately he was <unk> by forces <unk> by his own <unk> mr. gorbachev

 while rival abc news <unk> the competition in live coverage of the event by sheer luck the network was broadcasting the world series from candlestick park when the quake struck nbc news was unable to get its signal out of san francisco for the first hour after the quake 
 i have to attribute the lackluster performance to a natural disaster said mr. <unk> 
 so before i start to be really critical of nbc i would like to know more about what happened 
 there were no complaints from affiliates of cbs inc. and cable news network a unit of turner broadcasting system inc 
 but that was not the case at nbc news which has been dogged with the image of not being aggressive on major breaking stories 
 last summer the affiliates bitterly complained to network executives about the poor coverage of the student <unk> in china 
 i was not pleased with the slow start and neither was nbc news said guy <unk> general manager of nbc affiliate wave in louisville <unk> 
 a spokesman for national broadcasting co. a unit of general electric co. said the network was looking into what happened 
 the stations said they were pleased with the extended coverage yesterday including a special <unk> edition of today 
 don <unk> director of news at nbc news said in an interview that we could n't get a signal out of san francisco 
 we were out of the box 
 it was horrible 
 the comment we 're hearing is that we were slow out of the box but beat everyone else in the stretch 
 nbc broadcast throughout the entire night and did not go off the air until noon yesterday 
 the quake postponed the third and fourth games of the world series 
 in place of the games abc said it planned to broadcast next week 's episodes of its prime-time wednesday and thursday <unk> except for a one-hour special on the earthquake at N p.m. last night 
 the series is scheduled to resume tuesday evening in san francisco 
 there are no commercials to make up for since we 're going to eventually broadcast the world series said a network spokesman 
 pinnacle west capital corp. said it suspended indefinitely its common stock dividend and reported a N N plunge in third-quarter net income 
 the announcement made after the close of trading caught analysts by surprise 
 the company closed at $ N a share down N cents in composite trading on the new york stock exchange 
 pinnacle west slashed its quarterly dividend to N cents per share from N cents in december saying at the time that it believed the new lower dividend was <unk> 
 a company spokesman said the decision to eliminate the dividend resulted from a quarterly <unk> and that circumstances had changed since the december announcement 
 he declined to elaborate 
 edward j. <unk> jr. an analyst at shearson lehman hutton inc. speculated that the sudden dividend elimination <unk> an expensive agreement with thrift regulators over the company 's insolvent merabank savings and loan unit 
 analysts have estimated that pinnacle west may have to <unk> between $ N million and $ N million into the merabank unit before turning the thrift over to federal regulators 
 the latest financial results at the troubled utility and thrift holding company based in phoenix ariz. reflect continuing problems at merabank and losses in real-estate venture-capital and <unk> operations 
 third-quarter net income slid to $ N million or six cents a share from $ N million or N cents a year earlier 
 utility operations the only company unit operating in the black in the latest period had a N N drop in profit to $ N million largely as a result of <unk> at the company 's huge palo <unk> nuclear facility and the cost of purchased replacement power 
 in other operations losses at merabank totaled $ N million in the latest quarter compared with a $ N million profit a year earlier 
 the latest quarter includes a $ N million addition to loan-loss reserves 
 as recently as august the company said it did n't <unk> a need for substantial additions to reserves 
 pinnacle 's <unk> development co real-estate unit 's loss narrowed to $ N million from $ N million 
 the latest period included a $ N million write-down on undeveloped land while the year-earlier period included a $ N million reserve for real-estate losses 
 losses at its <unk> resources co <unk> unit narrowed to $ N million from $ N million a year ago which included a $ N million write-down of utility inventories 
 losses at el <unk> investment co. the venture-capital operation widened to $ N million from $ N a year earlier 
 the latest quarter included a $ N million write-down of investments 
 equitec financial group said it will ask as many as N investors in N of its public real-estate limited partnerships to give approval to rolling them up into a new master limited partnership 
 under the proposal by equitec a financially troubled real-estate <unk> new york-based <unk> group inc. would replace equitec as the newly formed master limited partnership 's general partner and manager 
 shares of the new partnership would trade on an exchange like a stock 
 <unk> is a merchant bank whose activities include the ownership management and financial restructuring of shopping centers office buildings apartments and other real estate 
 in a statement equitec chairman richard l. <unk> said the transfer will benefit both the company and investors in the N limited partnerships included in the proposed <unk> 
 while he did n't describe the partnerships ' financial condition he said their operations continue to drain the resources of equitec 
 equitec posted a $ N million net loss in the second quarter on $ N million of revenue compared with a net loss of $ N million in the year-earlier period on revenue of $ N million 
 in new york stock exchange composite trading equitec closed at $ N a share unchanged 
 because of tuesday 's earthquake in northern california company officials could n't immediately be reached for additional comment 
 a spokesman for <unk> said the N limited partnerships which were marketed by brokerage firms and financial planners between N and N raised several hundred million dollars from investors 
 with airline deals in a tailspin legendary wall street trader michael steinhardt could have trouble <unk> out of usair group traders say 
 only a week ago when airline buy-out fever was already <unk> down mr. steinhardt was engaged in a <unk> with usair 
 he was threatening to take over the carrier after spending an estimated $ N million to build an N N usair stake for his investment clients 
 the would-be raider even hired an investment banker to give teeth to his takeover threat which was widely interpreted as an effort to flush out an acquirer for usair or for his own stake 
 in fighting usair mr. steinhardt was <unk> against another investor <unk> warren buffett who bought into usair to help fend off mr. steinhardt 
 mr. buffett 's firm <unk> <unk> holds a much bigger stake in the carrier than mr. steinhardt 's firm steinhardt partners 
 now in the wake of ual 's troubles in financing its buy-out the airline <unk> game has been <unk> 
 instead of hoping to sell his usair stake at analysts ' estimated buy-out price of $ N a share mr. steinhardt is stuck with roughly N million usair shares that cost him $ N on average but yesterday closed at N N up N in new york stock exchange composite trading 
 it does n't make sense to <unk> out at this price mr. steinhardt says though he has stopped his takeover talk and now <unk> usair managers ' operating skills 
 at the current price the usair holding represents N N of all the assets that mr. steinhardt manages 
 a week ago usair stock briefly soared above N after a report in usa today that mr. steinhardt might launch a hostile bid for the carrier though takeover speculators say they were skeptical 
 if usair is worth N as a takeover and the stock went to N the market was saying steinhardt 's presence was n't worth anything in terms of getting a deal done says a veteran takeover <unk> 
 traders say this all goes to show that even the <unk> money manager can get infected with crowd <unk> 
 in trying to <unk> usair mr. steinhardt abandoned his usual role as a passive investor and ran into <unk> 
 moreover unlike mr. buffett who often holds big stakes in companies for years mr. steinhardt has n't in the past done much long-term investing 
 mr. steinhardt who runs about $ N billion for steinhardt partners made his name as a <unk> trader moving in and out of stocks with <unk> <unk> himself and his investment clients 
 meanwhile his big losses for instance in N 's crash generally have been trading losses 
 so some see a special irony in the fact that mr. steinhardt the trader now is <unk> with a massive <unk> airline holding 
 analysts say usair stock might lose four or five points if the steinhardt stake was dumped all at once 
 as a result mr. steinhardt must <unk> himself to selling usair at a loss or to holding the shares as an old-fashioned investment 
 long-term investing that 's not steinhardt 's style <unk> an investor who once worked at steinhardt partners 
 he does n't usually risk that much unless he thinks he has an <unk> in the hole adds another steinhardt partners <unk> 
 in recent days traders say usair has been buying its own shares as part of a program to retire about eight million usair shares though the carrier wo n't discuss its buy-back program 
 if usair stepped up its share purchases that might be a way for mr. steinhardt to get out says timothy <unk> a merrill lynch analyst 
 but usair might not want to help mr. steinhardt he adds 
 in N usair chairman edwin <unk> <unk> when trans world airlines chairman carl icahn threatened to take over the carrier 
 mr. icahn a much more practiced raider than mr. steinhardt eventually sold a big usair stake at a tiny profit through bear stearns 
 mr. steinhardt also could take that route 
 he <unk> big trading commissions on wall street firms 
 however with airline stocks <unk> he might not get a very good price for his shares traders say 
 especially <unk> for mr. steinhardt say people close to him is that usair 's mr. <unk> wo n't even take his telephone calls 
 while usair is n't considered absolutely <unk> its defenses including the sale in august of a N N stake in the company to mr. buffett 's <unk> <unk> are pretty strong 
 usair 's deal with mr. buffett was n't exactly a <unk> example of shareholder democracy mr. steinhardt says 
 since last april the investor has made seven so-called <unk> filings in usair as he bought and sold the company 's stock 
 such disclosures of big holdings often are used by raiders to try to scare a company 's managers and to stir interest in the stock 
 but of course it would be highly unusual for an investment fund such as steinhardt partners to take over a company 
 usair and mr. buffett wo n't talk about mr. steinhardt at all 
 analysts say usair has great promise 
 by the second half of N usair stock could hit N says <unk> <unk> of shearson lehman hutton 
 she thinks traders should buy the stock if it <unk> to N 
 but meanwhile usair is expected to show losses or lackluster profit for several quarters as it tries to digest <unk> airlines which it acquired 
 moreover some investors think a recession or renewed <unk> wars will <unk> airline stocks in coming months 
 however mr. steinhardt says he 's comfortable holding usair as an investment 
 while he has bought and sold some usair shares in recent days he says that contrary to rumors he has n't tried to unload his holding 
 mr. steinhardt adds that he bought usair stock earlier this year as part of a fundamental investment in the airline group 
 in N mr. steinhardt says he made money trading in texas air amr and ual 
 overall his investments so far this year are showing gains of about N N he adds 
 does mr. steinhardt regret his <unk> into the <unk> game 
 people close to the investor say that was an experiment he is unlikely to repeat 
 i do n't think you 'll find i 'm making a radical change in my traditional investment style mr. steinhardt says 
 <unk> resources inc. said it called for redemption on nov. N its $ N million outstanding of N N convertible subordinated debentures due N 
 the debentures were issued in the face amount of $ N million on july N N the ashland ky. coal mining water transportation and construction company said 
 the company said the redemption is permitted because the price of <unk> 's stock has <unk> or exceeded $ N for N consecutive trading days a condition set in the terms of the debentures 
 debenture holders are expected to convert most of the debentures into common because the value of the stock received in a conversion would exceed the $ N redemption price 
 commodore international ltd. said it will report a loss for the first quarter ended sept. N because sales of personal computers for the home market remained weak in some major countries 
 that will mark the second consecutive quarterly loss for commodore and will raise additional questions about whether it can sustain the turnaround it had seemed to be engineering 
 commodore west <unk> pa. had said in august that it was consolidating manufacturing to cut costs and expected to be profitable in the fiscal first quarter 
 commodore said that its announcement is based on preliminary information and that the situation could look different by the time final results are announced early next month 
 in fact commodore 's fiscal fourth-quarter loss was $ N million narrower than commodore had expected a few weeks after the quarter closed 
 still even results approaching break-even would mark a sharp weakening compared with fiscal N first-quarter earnings of $ N million or N cents a share on sales of $ N million 
 reflecting concerns about commodore 's outlook its stock has plunged more than N N since may closing yesterday unchanged at $ N a share in composite trading on the new york stock exchange 
 the price can be expected to erode further because the loss estimate came after the market closed 
 commodore has seemed to be setting the stage recently for progress in the u.s. where its personal-computer sales have been so dismal for years that commodore is close to dropping off research firms ' market-share charts 
 commodore has assembled an experienced management team it has persuaded many more dealers to carry its products and it has <unk> a <unk> advertising campaign 
 but those represent long-term strategies that probably wo n't succeed quickly even if they turn out to be the right ones 
 in the meantime the strategies will increase expenses 
 commodore had been counting on its consumer business to stay sufficiently healthy to support its efforts in other areas mainly in getting schools and businesses to use its <unk> which has <unk> graphics yet has been slow to catch on because it is n't compatible with apple computer inc. or international business machines corp. hardware 
 but sales to consumers have become difficult during the past several months even in west germany which has been by far commodore 's strongest market 
 the commodore N and N mainly used for children 's educational software and games had surprised market researchers by continuing to produce strong sales even though other <unk> personal computers now operate several times as fast and have much more memory 
 commodore has said it expects sales to rebound but market researchers have said that sales of the <unk> products may finally be <unk> off

 south korean president roh <unk> woo <unk> aside suggestions that the won be <unk> again said the currency 's current level against the dollar is appropriate

 the u.s. wants a higher won to make south korea 's exports more expensive and help trim seoul 's trade surplus 
 many south korean business people want a devaluation instead arguing that the won 's recent gains already have weakened the country 's export performance 
 mr. roh also said south korea is taking steps that would free the won to respond to market forces 
 seoul has pointed to its lack of a foreign exchange market as one reason the won 's value remains heavily controlled 
 mr. roh said a u.s. demand for the removal of south korean import quotas on beef will be resolved <unk> but gave no hint when that will happen

 great american bank said its board approved the formation of a holding company enabling the savings bank to pursue <unk> banking activities under a new federal law 
 the proposed holding company 's primary purpose would be to allow great american to continue engaging in real estate development activities it said 
 those activities generated $ N million in operating profit last year 
 but according to great american such profits do n't count toward meeting the san diego savings bank 's new capitalization requirements under N federal law 
 the new real estate unit would have a separate capital structure to comply with the law 
 the proposed holding company would also consolidate great american bank in san diego and its tucson ariz. savings bank into a single federally chartered institution in san diego 
 the consolidation is expected to save $ N million a year in administrative costs a great american spokesman said 
 dale lang who this week completed the acquisition of the publisher of ms. and sassy is <unk> about the challenge he is taking on 
 mr. lang admits that ms. is in dire <unk> and that sassy needs big promotional dollars to keep it alive 
 but the <unk> publisher has moved quickly and <unk> to deal with the magazines ' problems 
 last friday he told the staff of ms. that the magazine in january would begin publishing without advertising 
 mr. lang will do away with expensive circulation drives not to mention sales staff and attempt to publish the <unk> magazine supported by circulation revenue alone 
 any fool can publish a money-losing magazine 
 i want to publish one that succeeds said mr. lang 
 for ms. it 's time to publish for the reader not the advertiser 
 as for sassy which competes directly with news corp. 's <unk> magazine mr. lang says that in the next two years he will spend $ N million promoting and improving the magazine 
 though sassy has grown quickly since its debut in march N it has been the target of conservative lobbyists and <unk> advertisers who <unk> at its frank editorial matter on <unk> problems 
 mr. lang said the former australian owners of sassy were <unk> by the moral majority 
 their reaction was to do nothing and ride it out 
 he said sassy will keep its <unk> tone but added we will keep a close watch on the editorial content of the magazine 
 sassy already has recovered circulation has quickly passed the N mark and advertising pages have stabilized this year at more than N 
 what 's more mr. lang says he has what all publishers wish for a <unk> <unk> niche 
 <unk> is written more for mothers not their daughters said mr. lang 
 but sassy has a different spirit 
 it gets more mail in a month than mccall 's got in a year and it 's not from mothers 
 i feel about sassy like i did about working woman N years ago 
 mr. lang took on ms. and sassy with the acquisition of <unk> publications inc. by his newly formed lang communications 
 lang owns N N of <unk> while citicorp owns the rest through its citicorp venture capital partners 
 two weeks ago citicorp and mr. lang pumped $ N into <unk> just to keep the doors open 
 industry observers have <unk> mr. lang on what some call his <unk> handling of ms. but his track record in magazine publishing in general has gotten mixed reviews 
 besides ms. and sassy closely held lang communications includes success a magazine for entrepreneurs and small businesses and working woman and working mother two monthly magazines 
 working woman with circulation near one million and working mother with N circulation are legitimate magazine success stories 
 the magazine success however was for years lackluster and <unk> 
 only recently has it been <unk> <unk> and its editorial product improved 
 success is expected to gain at least because of the recent <unk> of rival venture another magazine for growing companies 
 working woman and working mother have operated as part of working <unk> 's group a <unk> joint venture between mr. lang and time warner inc 
 the joint venture is being <unk> with mccall 's magazine being sold last summer to the new york times co. 's magazine group for about $ N million and time warner agreeing to sell back its N N interest in working woman and working mother to mr. lang 
 executives at time inc magazine co. a subsidiary of time warner have said the joint venture with mr. lang was n't a good one 
 the venture formed in N was supposed to be time 's low-cost safe entry into women 's magazines 
 mr. lang surprised time soon after joining forces when he said he would negotiate rates <unk> with advertisers a practice common in broadcasting but considered <unk> by magazine publishers 
 in addition mccall 's put in a less than <unk> performance 
 until a recent comeback it saw steep losses in ad pages and circulation 
 time executives complained about the <unk> editorial quality and in the end one time executive who asked not to be identified said frankly mccall 's and the joint venture were an embarrassment 
 mr. lang feels that time 's priorities changed 
 their management changed right after the venture was formed and i do n't think they were comfortable getting into the competitive wars of women 's service magazines 
 today mr. lang believes his magazines will offer what many women 's magazines do n't 
 we write straight for women on their level he said 
 we do n't have passive readers 
 mr. lang points out that even success in part fits the company 's image since about N N of its <unk> is female 
 mr. lang has named carol <unk> N as group publisher of new york-based lang communications 
 she will oversee working woman working mother and success magazines and retain her post as publisher of working woman 
 the sale price of mccall 's twice what mr. lang originally paid for it will finance lang communications ' buy-back of time warner 's N N interest in working woman and working mother 
 mr. lang says he is n't <unk> new acquisitions at least for now 
 we would have to go outside to banks to get the money and i am not ready to do that he said 
 besides we have enough on our plate 
 there is plenty of work to be done on what we have

 could the collapse of <unk> have been prevented 
 that was the question structural engineers and california transportation officials were asking themselves yesterday as rescue workers began the <unk> task of trying to extract as many as N victims from beneath the concrete <unk> of the <unk> nimitz freeway in oakland that <unk> in during tuesday 's temblor 
 after <unk> the area california gov. george deukmejian late yesterday called for an inquiry into the freeway 's collapse blaming the disaster on <unk> construction the associated press reported 
 the impact of the destruction of this <unk> stretch of highway was <unk> measured in lost lives 
 but there are other long-term effects that raise serious questions about the ability of california 's infrastructure to withstand a major temblor 
 it could easily be two years before the <unk> artery that helps <unk> oakland with san francisco is reopened and the cost to build a new stretch of highway could soar to more than $ N million said charles j. o'connell deputy district director in los angeles of the california department of transportation <unk> caltrans 
 caltrans in sacramento said total damage from the collapsed highway is estimated at around $ N million 
 the aftershocks of the highway tragedy are <unk> in los angeles as well as local politicians spoke yesterday against plans to bring <unk> to los angeles freeways by N 
 caltrans plans to add a second deck for buses and car pools above the median of a <unk> stretch of the harbor freeway just south of los angeles near the <unk> <unk> 
 los angeles county supervisor kenneth hahn yesterday vowed to fight the introduction of <unk> in the area 
 caltrans abandoned <unk> in the early 1970s following the N <unk> earthquake that destroyed freeway sections just north of los angeles mr. o'connell explained 
 that temblor measured N on the richter scale tuesday 's was 
 so why even consider <unk> freeways now 
 we 've run out of places to build freeways in l.a. and the only place to go is up mr. o'connell said although he acknowledges there are many obstacles including cost 
 but as for safety he says <unk> freeways built today with the heavily reinforced concrete and <unk> columns required after the <unk> quake should withstand a <unk> temblor of N to N on the richter scale 
 reasons for the collapse of the nimitz freeway were <unk> yesterday 
 but most structural engineers attributed the destruction to improper reinforcement of the columns that supported the <unk> and the fact that the ground beneath the highway is largely landfill and can become unstable or <unk> in a major quake 
 the <unk> roadway designed in the <unk> and completed in N was supported by columns that apparently lacked the kind of steel reinforcement used in highways today 
 while the <unk> did have long metal bars running <unk> through them for reinforcement they apparently lacked an adequate number of metal ties that run <unk> through the column said leo parker a structural engineer in los angeles 
 caltrans today uses a <unk> of the design mr. parker describes with <unk> steel <unk> inside 
 but in the case of the nimitz freeway the lack of such support caused the core of the columns to <unk> and buckle under the weight of the second deck <unk> <unk> who were lined up in <unk> <unk> traffic on the lower deck nearly N feet below 
 officials of the state agency did n't have any immediate explanation why the reinforcement did n't hold up 
 caltrans reinforced the highway in N as part of a $ N million statewide project using steel <unk> to tie the <unk> of the freeway to the columns and prevent the structure from <unk> in a quake 
 caltrans spokesman jim <unk> in sacramento declined to identify the engineering firm that did the reinforcement work 
 liability in the bridge and road <unk> will <unk> around whether government took reasonable care to build and maintain the structures says john <unk> a <unk> wash. personal-injury attorney who specializes in highway design and maintenance cases 
 the firm brought in to strengthen the structure could be liable as well 
 the results of the quake certainly raise questions about whether reasonable care was taken mr. <unk> says 
 given the seismic history of the bay area it seems to me that a N earthquake is a foreseeable event 
 caltrans ' mr. <unk> defended the agency 's work on the nimitz freeway 
 the work was done properly he said 
 basically we had a severe earthquake of significant <unk> and it was just something the structure could n't withstand 
 ironically caltrans this year began working on a second round of seismic <unk> of freeways around the state this time <unk> freeway columns in steel <unk> to reinforce them 
 but only bridges supported with single rows of columns were top priority and the nimitz freeway supported by double rows was left out mr. <unk> explained 
 the reason is that the technology is such that we 're not able to <unk> <unk> structures he said

 the white house is making sure nobody will accuse it of taking this crisis <unk> 
 in the aftermath of the california earthquake president bush and his aides flew into a <unk> of earthquake-related activity yesterday morning 
 some of it was necessary to get federal help flowing to victims but some seemed designed mostly to project an image of a white house in action 
 mr. bush and his aides were accused of responding too slowly after the exxon <unk> oil tanker split open in alaskan waters and hurricane hugo struck the carolina coast and they clearly do n't want a repeat of those charges now 
 so the white house announced that mr. bush got his first earthquake briefing of the day at N a.m. from chief of staff john <unk> 
 by noon mr. bush had taken two phone calls from vice president dan quayle who was in california made a televised statement of concern signed a disaster <unk> received a written report from the federal emergency management agency and visited fema headquarters 
 mr. bush himself essentially acknowledged that he and his aides were trying to head off criticism 
 on his fema visit mr. bush said that he hoped there would be less <unk> about the emergency office 's performance this time adding that the agency took a hit for its reaction to hurricane hugo

 the <unk> <unk> that <unk> the san francisco bay area rated a N on the richter scale did n't match the great earthquake of N rated at N

 the ground <unk> along a <unk> stretch of the san andreas fault on tuesday mr. johnson added 
 in N the <unk> was N miles long and a couple feet wide

 but the greatest damage was visited on buildings and roadways <unk> upon landfill as were the marina district of san francisco and the bay bridge two areas of maximum devastation 
 landfill loose and unconsolidated earth may feel like rock but it <unk> like liquid when you shake it said douglas <unk> professor of <unk> at san francisco state university in a televised interview 
 it <unk> in a <unk> <unk> pattern 
 our quake behaved much like the mexico city earthquake where great damage was miles from the epicenter 
 mr. johnson of the berkeley <unk> station said landfill can be done if it 's properly <unk> 
 you can drive <unk> on it and build on it 
 he cited the example of san francisco 's financial district where many new glass towers survived almost <unk> 
 but the public policy issues raised by earthquake damage will be difficult to address mr. johnson predicted 
 the attention span of the public is short he said 
 we 've known for years and years we 've got lots of old <unk> <unk> brick and <unk> buildings 
 one old building the golden state bank building on front street had its yellow brick <unk> <unk> off by the shock of the quake leaving a wedge of its third floor open to the air while <unk> of dusty bricks tumbled to the street below narrowly missing <unk> <unk> and cars

 it 's a danger 
 we know it 's there 
 and sooner or later we have to do something about it

 the name classic coke has tremendous value and they have n't <unk> that name before says <unk> <unk> publisher of the trade journal beverage digest

 dow closed at $ N a share up N cents in new york stock exchange composite trading

 dow would earn $ N a share for the year if it <unk> that year-ago fourth-quarter performance 
 dow officials were <unk> that the company would earn less than $ N a share this year even before they announced in july a plan to acquire N N of <unk> laboratories inc 
 that acquisition could further <unk> earnings per share this year the company spokeswoman said 
 dow has n't said exactly what impact the <unk> acquisition will have on N earnings 
 dow blamed the third-quarter earnings drop on several factors including softer prices for polyethylene and other basic chemicals a slower u.s. economy and a stronger dollar which made dow 's exports from the u.s. more expensive to overseas customers

 whether or not great cases make <unk> as justice holmes asserted who can doubt that when great confirmation hearings turn on the <unk> 's response to these great cases they make bad judicial history 
 <unk> bronner 's battle for justice how the bork nomination shook america norton N pages $ N is a <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of these hearings done with <unk> <unk> but with a flawed legal philosophy 
 while the book <unk> justifies its <unk> the title itself is dubious 
 what shook america was not a battle for justice but for naked power in which an army of judicial activists rolled over a judge they had <unk> 
 in its basic structure and style the book is <unk> with <unk> character portrayal <unk> action and <unk> <unk> of the sort more likely to be encountered in a washington <unk> than in a constitutional history 
 mr. bronner seems to believe that the hearings could have gone either way 
 i doubt that 
 given democratic frustration with the reagan victories and court appointments the <unk> plans in place and mr. bork 's paper trail of vulnerable <unk> it was pretty clear that judge bork never stood much chance of being confirmed 
 as mr. bronner himself says the <unk> of raw meat was in the air 
 perhaps because they won mr. bork 's <unk> come through more <unk> than his defenders 
 ralph <unk> was the organizing <unk> <unk> a conglomerate of pressure groups into an <unk> attacking force 
 harvard 's laurence tribe was the constitutional heavy laying out legal strategies for the senators and witnesses to follow 
 but it was ted kennedy who scored most effectively with his <unk> portrayal of robert bork 's america the parade of <unk> <unk> that would follow <unk> he claimed from the positions mr. bork had taken over the space of two decades 
 sen. kennedy never mind his dubious credentials for the moral high ground <unk> <unk> 
 i add two others 
 republican sen. <unk> specter of pennsylvania engaged the <unk> in a <unk> contest aimed at showing that mr. bork was willing to stretch the constitution in one area free speech while remaining rigid in all the others 
 it achieved a good media play and enabled sen. specter and others to vote against mr. bork out of <unk> 
 further <unk> came from left legal <unk> ronald <unk> who in the new york review of books painted a picture of a constitutional <unk> <unk> reading his personal <unk> into the constitution particularly in the area of original intent 
 the charge of being outside the mainstream of legal thought <unk> undercut mr. bork 's <unk> standing leaving him bleeding on the platform 
 the nomination still might have been <unk> if a number of democratic <unk> in the south and southwest had broken party lines 
 but democratic sen. bennett johnson of louisiana reminded the little band that <unk> blacks and women could <unk> the margin to punish them in their next senate elections 
 <unk> <unk> with mainstream and <unk> to seal robert bork 's fate 
 the <unk> 
 mr. bork 's opponents chose the <unk> held it and kept it 
 yet with the smooth confirmation of anthony kennedy an N <unk> only slightly less supportive of judicial restraint than mr. bork the democrats may have won the battle but lost the war 
 another <unk> however was the <unk> message the bork hearings sent into the judicial culture from which the supreme court draws its talent 
 the word went forth to every law school that those with federal court ambitions must travel a safe constitutional <unk> with no paper trail and no <unk> to their <unk> or <unk> 
 unfortunately the author simply does n't supply the <unk> frame to sustain his <unk> <unk> 
 he has too readily <unk> the case for the activist law school culture 
 probing more deeply into the doctrine of judicial restraint he would have found a long history going back to the great decisions of justice holmes 
 he would discover it also in alexander <unk> a <unk> constitutional scholar mr. bork 's <unk> friend at yale whose influence on the judge goes well beyond mr. bronner 's reporting 
 still the long view of robert bork as constitutional <unk> must be a <unk> one 
 his strength lies in his <unk> doctrine which keeps the court clear of <unk> group pressures and leaves most decisions in a democracy to elected legislatures and executives 
 unfortunately mr. bork failed to <unk> between such pressures and the emergence of great issues critical to a society that must be settled <unk> if it is to <unk> 
 the question of <unk> schools in brown vs. board of education was such an issue 
 in our time abortion has become another best left to a line of supreme court decisions rather than to the chaos of N state legislatures 
 a <unk> and growing consensus of americans clearly wishes to apply the right to privacy in contraceptive matters decided in the <unk> case to abortion as well 
 one can understand mr. bork 's fear that the new right to privacy will become <unk> stretched though a supreme court composed of men and women with <unk> <unk> and a sense of limits should be able to manage it 
 what is certain is that if americans allow another happening like the <unk> bork confirmation circus it will be at their <unk>

 sotheby 's inc. the world 's biggest auction house is taking a huge wall <unk> risk on the outcome of the sale of art from the estate of john t. dorrance jr. the campbell soup co. heir 
 the financial services division has guaranteed the dorrance family that it will receive a minimum of $ N million for the collection regardless of what the bids for the art works total people close to the transaction say 
 the collection which includes two early <unk> a van <unk> a <unk> other paintings furniture and <unk> went on sale last night in the first of six auctions 
 what sotheby 's is doing closely resembles an underwriting by an investment bank 
 a corporation that wants to sell stock or bonds goes to a wall street firm which purchases the securities outright accepting the financial risk of finding buyers 
 if the investment bank can sell the securities at a higher price than it paid the issuer it makes a profit 
 at the initial sale last night for example the sale featuring the <unk> masters bids totaled $ N million 
 that was slightly above sotheby 's <unk> estimate of $ N million 
 normally sotheby 's would have earned N N of the total in commissions 
 instead people familiar with the transaction said the auction house opted to <unk> that percentage in order to obtain the collection and in exchange for taking a bigger chunk of proceeds exceeding $ N million 
 art dealers say that while auction houses occasionally guarantee the seller of a highly desirable work of art a minimum price a financial commitment of this size is unprecedented 
 <unk> d. brooks president of sotheby 's north america division <unk> denies it offered the dorrance <unk> a <unk> guarantee calling such reports inaccurate 
 buried in the glossy <unk> catalog for the sale however appears the statement sotheby 's has an interest in the property in this catalog 
 explains a sotheby 's spokeswoman the statement means exactly what it says 
 we have some level of financial interest in the collection 
 we do n't disclose <unk> 
 frank <unk> a lawyer for the dorrance estate with the philadelphia law firm of morgan lewis & <unk> declines to comment on the financial arrangements 
 sotheby 's made the $ N million guarantee to keep the dorrance collection away from its archrival auction house christie 's international plc christie 's has handled smaller sales for the dorrance family over the years 
 when christie 's officials asked why the firm was n't picked to sell the dorrance collection representatives of the dorrance family told us it was a question of financial considerations said michael <unk> christie 's head of <unk> and modern paintings 
 collectors who have made their money on wall street have become an increasingly important part of the art business and their money has helped fuel the art boom but recently it appears sotheby 's has been returning the <unk> 
 in november N sotheby 's essentially offered a wall <unk> bridge loan of about $ N million to australian businessman alan bond to enable him to purchase vincent van <unk> 's <unk> for $ N million 
 it was the highest bid in history for a work of art 
 but two weeks ago sotheby 's said that it has the painting under lock and key because the loan had not been fully repaid 
 sotheby 's is offering such deals because it 's an art sellers ' market at least where the best works are concerned says ralph <unk> an attorney and author of the book art law 
 there seems to be a lot of art for sale but there 's more competition 
 the competition gives the seller the ability to cut a better deal he says 
 the dorrance family will still receive a substantial portion of the auction proceeds above $ N million people familiar with the transaction said 
 but it 's likely that sotheby 's will take a higher than usual commission called an override on the amount exceeding the guarantee 
 sotheby 's has been aggressively promoting the dorrance sale 
 at a news conference last may announcing plans for the auction sotheby 's estimated its value in excess of $ N million 
 more recently sotheby 's has predicted the collection will fetch $ N million 
 that 's the highest estimate for a single collection in auction history 
 the decision to put the entire collection on the block stunned many since mr. dorrance had served as chairman of the philadelphia museum of art and it had been assumed many of the works would be donated to the institution 
 at last night 's sale N of N works that sold were purchased by <unk> international gallery the <unk> unit of aichi financial a japanese conglomerate that owns N N of christie 's 
 meanwhile sotheby 's guarantee is raising <unk> in the art world 
 the consumer has to throw out the idea that the auction house is a <unk> <unk> says new york art dealer david <unk> 
 while he adds that he has no problem with auction houses who sell works in which they have a financial interest it ought not to be hidden in some small print 
 in such situations he says the house is going to put the best light on things 
 for example an auction house 's comments on the condition of a work of art that is up for sale should be looked at with very open eyes he says 
 there 's more and more of this <unk> going on at every level says bruce miller president of art funding corp. an art lender 
 dealers and auction houses know if they do n't lay out a half a million for this another one will it 's that competitive 
 in january two small new york <unk> the <unk> <unk> gallery and <unk> fine arts <unk> a major art collection owned by the <unk> family away from rival <unk> bidders with an <unk> payment of about $ N million 
 a christie 's spokeswoman said that while the auction house sometimes <unk> its seller 's commission to attract art works it still gets a commission from the buyer christie 's wo n't offer financial guarantees because christie 's believes its primary role is as an auction house and therefore as an agent for buyer and seller not as a bank 
 egon krenz the man tapped yesterday to become east germany 's new leader faces the same task that has fallen to neighboring socialist colleagues <unk> a country in crisis 
 but unlike the other new leaders in the east bloc mr. krenz will face an immediate threat to his nation 's very existence german reunification 
 mr. krenz age N is known as an <unk> <unk> one likely to continue the method of running a country that the berlin wall made famous 
 even if he were to change his <unk> and become another milton <unk> however he would still stand a good chance of losing a country 
 mr. krenz almost certainly will be a younger version of erich honecker his rigid predecessor as dictator 
 mr. krenz has followed much the same career path as mr. honecker both spent years overseeing the <unk> deutsche <unk> the youth group that is the communist regime 's principal tool for <unk> young germans into socialist citizens 
 more recently mr. krenz has been in charge of east german security and is the youngest member of the ruling politburo 
 faced with another mr. honecker so many <unk> east germans are likely to <unk> that the two german peoples will get their reunification de <unk> on west german ground 
 but if east germany 's <unk> politburo does loosen up enough to permit mr. krenz to make serious efforts at reform he will face a challenge just as fundamental 
 abandoning socialism means abandoning the east german state 's reason for existence and with it the <unk> for its <unk> and its wall 
 in this scenario it 's hard to imagine that a pale <unk> of the federal republic could avoid being pulled into some kind of tie economic federal or stronger with west germany 
 mr. krenz may need a bit of time to consolidate his empire which would do a lot to promote reunification scenario one 
 <unk> in west germany have already <unk> the exodus by <unk> an <unk> placed by mr. honecker wanted one people 
 the west german <unk> in <unk> <unk> and warsaw are continuing to find refugees at their gates 
 of course east germany true to its tradition could tighten its borders yet further 
 two of the last gestures of the honecker regime were to close the border to czechoslovakia and install <unk> lights in some spots along the <unk> 
 but with world-wide opinion even apparently in moscow against east germany the country would have to turn itself into an <unk> to <unk> down further on refugees 
 there have been some reports that mr. krenz is moving to soften his reputation notably rumors that it was he who kept east germany 's state police off protesters ' backs at the country 's dismal <unk> anniversary <unk> earlier this month 
 but even if he effects a <unk> <unk> he will face a serious ideological crisis and reunification scenario two 
 the problem is one that east germany shares with other <unk> such as north korea but one it must shoulder alone in the east bloc 
 when poland moves to reform it can at least lean on its past however flawed and short-lived joseph <unk> 's <unk> republic it was a <unk> democracy 
 <unk> reformers can recall the <unk> <unk> of the same period in their country 
 even the soviet union has peter the great to <unk> should it choose to 
 but east germany is merely the land of truly existing socialism 
 beyond that it has to compete with west germany for a claim to the german identity 
 up to now the main weapon of the worker and peasant state has been the <unk> of socialism 
 with talk today of a second economic <unk> in west germany east germany no longer can content itself with being the economic star in a loser league 
 without moscow 's military and party behind it east germany runs the risk of <unk> 
 if it goes capitalist and increases trade with west germany it will convert itself <unk> into an economic <unk> of the federal republic 
 there 's a certain <unk> logic at work here it 's particularly appropriate and <unk> that the land that produced <unk> <unk> should prove socialism 's failure in an experiment that uses its own people as controls 
 there may be forces that would delay this scenario 
 <unk> are the last to surrender and germans are an ideological people 
 the protesters who greeted mikhail gorbachev at east berlin 's airport earlier this month were n't shouting go u.s.a they were <unk> <unk> help us 
 <unk> on the other side of the border can also slow the process 
 helmut kohl 's governing conservative coalition is proving <unk> true to the west german constitution by making more than N people of german <unk> automatic citizens this year alone 
 but within the government and in the think tanks outside it many west germans maintain that they do n't want immediate reunification 
 politically this currently is wisdom particularly given a nervous neighboring france 
 but it would be ironic if germany 's reunification just like its division eventually were the result of actions in centers of power other than bonn and berlin 
 in a statement that was as close as east germany gets to practicing glasnost <unk> <unk> an east german party <unk> actually acknowledged the reunification dilemma 
 the main problem mr. <unk> said in an east german radio interview monitored by radio free europe in <unk> stems from the fact that the <unk> is different from other east european states 
 what kind of right to exist he asked would a capitalist german democratic republic have alongside a capitalist federal republic 
 that 's a question east germany ca n't answer easily no matter what its new leader does

 news of the major earthquake in california tuesday triggered a round of dollar sales in early asian trade but most foreign-exchange dealers said they expect the impact of the quake on financial markets to be short-lived 
 despite the dollar 's lackluster performance some foreign-exchange traders maintain that the u.s. unit remains relatively well bid 
 harris trust 's mr. <unk> noted that the unit continues to show resilience in the face of a <unk> of headline <unk> in recent weeks including rate increases in europe and japan aggressive central bank intervention a 190-point plunge in new york stock prices an unexpectedly poor u.s. trade report and action by the federal reserve to <unk> u.s. rates lower

 since friday 's dive in stock market prices the fed has <unk> reserves into the banking system in an effort to calm the markets and <unk> a repeat of N 's stock market debacle 
 some analysts note that after last week 's stock market tailspin and tuesday 's california earthquake it 's hard to gauge where the central bank wants the key federal funds rate 
 they say that the earthquake by preventing many banks from operating at full capacity has given the fed an additional reason to keep liquidity at a high level 
 the fed did in fact execute $ N billion of <unk> customer repurchase agreements the third set of repurchase orders in three days 
 analysts said the additional liquidity should tend to reduce the federal funds rate 
 for now traders say the foreign exchange market is <unk> both federal funds and events on wall street

 crude prices <unk> upward in brisk trading on the assumption that heavy earthquake damage occurred to san francisco area refinery <unk> but the rise quickly <unk> when it became apparent that oil operations were n't severely curtailed 
 trading on little specific information market players overnight in tokyo began bidding up oil prices 
 the rally spread into european markets where traders were still betting that the earthquake disrupted the san francisco area 's large oil refining plants 
 by yesterday morning much of the world was still unable to reach san francisco by telephone 
 west texas intermediate was bid up more than N cents a barrel in many overseas markets 
 at the opening of the new york mercantile exchange west texas intermediate for november delivery shot up N cents a barrel to $ N still on the belief that the refineries were damaged 
 in the san francisco area roughly N barrels a day of crude about a third of all the refining capacity in california is processed daily according to industry data 
 for more than the past year even the rumor of a major west coast refinery shutdown has been enough to spark a futures rally because the gasoline market is so tight 
 but yesterday as the morning wore on some major west coast refinery operators including chevron corp. exxon corp. and the shell oil co. unit of royal <unk> group said their refineries were n't damaged and were continuing to operate normally 
 most said they shut down their petroleum pipeline operations as a <unk> but did n't see any immediate damage 
 gasoline terminals were also largely <unk> they said 
 it 's hard to imagine how the markets were <unk> given that nobody could get through to san francisco said one <unk> oil company executive 
 as the news spread that the refineries were intact crude prices plunged ending the day at $ N a barrel down N cents 
 gasoline for november delivery was off N cents a <unk> to N cents 
 heating oil finished at N cents down N cent 
 the market was basically acting on two <unk> forces said <unk> <unk> of shearson lehman hutton inc 
 one is the panic the earthquake in san francisco which is positive 
 but once that factor was eliminated traders took profits and focused on crude oil inventories mr. <unk> said 
 after the market closed tuesday the american petroleum institute had reported that crude stocks increased by N million barrels in the week ended friday which traders viewed as bearish 
 but some market players still think earthquake speculation could have more impact on the oil markets 
 the problem is that while on the surface everything is all right the question is said mr. <unk> was there any structural damage to the pipelines or anything else

 copper 
 futures prices eased on indications of improvement in the industry 's labor situation 
 the december contract declined N cents a pound to $ N 
 according to one analyst workers at the cananea copper mine in mexico which has n't been operating since it was declared bankrupt by the mexican government in late august are set to return to work 
 the analyst said it will take about two to three months before the mine begins to produce copper in significant quantities 
 he added that while there has n't been any official announcement as yet the highland valley mine strike in british columbia which has lasted more than three months is regarded as settled 
 another analyst said the cananea return to operation may not be as near as some expect 
 there are still negotiations taking place on whether there will be a loss of jobs which has been a critical issue all along he said 
 nevertheless the increasing likelihood that these two major supply disruptions will be resolved weighed on the market the analysts agreed 
 both of these mines are normally major suppliers of copper to japan which has been buying copper on the world market 
 the first analyst said that the japanese as well as the chinese bought copper earlier in the week in london but that this purchasing has since <unk> as the supply situation at least over the long term appears to have improved 
 the focus for some time has been on the copper supply and good demand has been taken for granted he said 
 now that the supply situation seems to be improving it would be best for traders to switch their concentration to the demand side 
 he noted the commerce department report yesterday that housing starts in september dropped N N from august to N million units on an annualized basis the lowest level in seven years 
 along with these factors other economic reports suggest a slowing of the economy which could mean reduced copper usage he said 
 sugar 
 futures prices extended tuesday 's gains 
 the march delivery ended with an advance of N cent a pound to N cents for a two-day gain of N cent 
 according to one dealer japan said it has only N tons of sugar remaining to be shipped to it this year by cuba under current commitments 
 the announcement was made because of reports tuesday that cuba would delay shipments to japan scheduled for later this year into early next year 
 the dealer said the quantity mentioned in the japanese announcement is so small that it 's <unk> 
 one analyst said he thought the market continued to be supported to some degree by a delay in the cuban sugar harvest caused by adverse weather 
 the dealer said india might be the real factor that is keeping futures prices firm 
 that country recently bought N tons of sugar and had been expected to seek a like quantity last week but did n't 
 it 's known they need the sugar and the expectation that they will come in is apparently giving the market its principal support the dealer said

 a new drug to prevent the rejection of <unk> <unk> has been successfully used on more than N patients at the university of pittsburgh according to researchers 
 the drug which is still in the experimental phase has n't been approved yet by the food and drug <unk> and its long-term effects are unknown 
 but researchers say the drug called fk-506 could <unk> the <unk> field by reducing harmful side effects and by lowering rejection rates 
 rejection has been the major obstacle in the approximately N <unk> transplants performed world-wide each year 
 researchers began using the drug in february on patients who had received kidney <unk> heart and <unk> transplants 
 only two of N transplants have been rejected 
 the drug discovered in N is <unk> from soil <unk> found in japan 
 the pittsburgh patients are the first humans to be given the drug which is made by fujisawa pharmaceutical co 
 we 're shocked by it because it 's worked so fast said dr. thomas e. <unk> director of the university of pittsburgh <unk> program at a news conference here yesterday 
 we consider it a <unk> drug like one for aids said dr. john <unk> an <unk> at the university of pittsburgh 
 researchers say they believe fk-506 is N times more effective than the traditional <unk> drug <unk> made by swiss pharmaceutical giant <unk> ltd 
 they are also encouraged by the relatively mild side effects of fk-506 compared with <unk> which can cause <unk> failure <unk> <unk> and other problems 
 the side effects of <unk> have made the penalty for its success rather high dr. <unk> said 
 dr. <unk> said that fk-506 would not be available in the market for at least a year and that the fda approval process usually takes three years to five years 
 there are no firm plans to expand the experimental program beyond the university of pittsburgh whose hospital <unk> the most transplants in the world 
 researchers could n't estimate the cost of the drug when it reaches the market but they said fk-506 will enable patients to cut hospital stays by N N and reduce the number of blood tests used to monitor the <unk> of <unk> and other drugs among transplant recipients 
 dr. <unk> said the research has been largely financed by the national institute of health and by university funds and that fujisawa did n't give the hospital any grants 
 he said that the research team had no financial stake in the drug 
 we 've known for six months the effect of this drug and our advice to our people has been not to buy the company 's stock dr. <unk> said adding that <unk> from fk-506 would n't be ethical 
 economist david n. laband 's sept. N editorial-page article in hugo 's path a <unk> disaster <unk> the control of price <unk> swiftly ordered by south carolina 's governor after hurricane hugo 
 according to mr. laband <unk> for price controls occurs when income <unk> threatens to hit home 
 to be sure the threat has hit home down here 
 yet in mr. laband 's <unk> of free-market logic human greed and <unk> are the only permissible psychological reactions 
 allowing <unk> prices for <unk> would indeed <unk> the lines at stores as he contends 
 but not because resources are going to their most efficient use leaving scarce goods allocated to those buyers who place the highest value on them 
 rather lines would <unk> because at higher prices many victims could not afford <unk> such as food and medical supplies 
 it is <unk> to <unk> that a poor <unk> woman can not receive immediate relief for her family at fair prices because she does not have as much to protect as a rich family 
 moreover essential relief supplies such as ice must be distributed throughout the population because of potential health problems from <unk> food and possible <unk> of disease 
 such <unk> effects give the state a right to intervene in the marketplace and temporarily coordinate allocation of resources 
 fortunately <unk> and charities are not motivated by <unk> but by <unk> 
 why should they have to <unk> with <unk> rushing in to turn a quick profit 
 these <unk> <unk> would be <unk> to take advantage of the situation if they ever expect to face the people of south carolina again 
 the government is actually protecting <unk> <unk> and other <unk> who can not see beyond their own short-term gain 
 south carolina deserves an a for its quick and timely relief efforts

 mr. laband gives us an idea why economists ' predictions are usually wrong 
 they set up absurd situations <unk> from reality and then try to reason from them 
 i 'm surprised he did n't advocate letting people <unk> since that behavior can also be <unk> in a disaster and every individual has an incentive to alter the distribution of income in his favor 
 price controls were so <unk> embraced by charleston because price <unk> in this situation is equivalent to <unk>

 mr. laband described one of the more <unk> threats we face when dealing with disasters such as hugo <unk> <unk> such as that by the charleston city council as it <unk> about trying to do something 
 since he concentrated on the economic <unk> of such <unk> he did n't mention certain other of their effects 
 they <unk> law-enforcement resources at a time they are most needed for protecting lives and property 
 also rather than increase supplies they reduce them and encourage <unk> 
 and they or even the prospect of them discourage disaster <unk> in the form of speculative advance <unk> of supplies by merchants

 would mr. laband also suggest that the red cross <unk> army military units police fire departments rescue units and individual citizens cease their efforts to assist hugo 's victims because they interfere with his concept of the free market 
 what about those <unk> people all over the country who are donating food water and other <unk> of life to these people who could be any of us 
 should they too stop <unk> with his free market 
 maybe he thinks they should also sell to the highest bidder

 this seems to be the season for <unk> in chicago 
 though the cubs ' championship season ended with the national league playoffs a revival of the organic theater 's production of <unk> <unk> a play in nine <unk> set in the <unk> field <unk> continues within <unk> distance of the <unk> 
 <unk> of a different sort also are being offered by our two major theater <unk> the goodman and steppenwolf 
 each is more <unk> than an unexpected <unk> baseball championship but both help explain why chicago remains a vital center of this country 's regional theater movement 
 the goodman is offering a <unk> version of <unk> 's the <unk> through nov. N 
 the original is a comedy about <unk> a man who sees <unk> and <unk> in everyone except himself 
 he is the <unk> friend of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> of <unk> 
 the play is filled with <unk> dishonesty and <unk> 
 <unk> years ago the <unk> richard wilbur <unk> this <unk> comedy merely by avoiding the <unk> sort of thing as he wrote in his introduction 
 otherwise the scene remained <unk> 's house in N 
 assuming modern audiences readily understand that <unk> 's social indictment covers their world as well as <unk> paris mr. wilbur concentrated his <unk> <unk> on <unk> the <unk> french <unk> into <unk> and theatrical english <unk> <unk> 
 the wilbur translation is remarkable well worth a read and even better seen in the theater if you ever have the opportunity 
 but if you happen to be coming to chicago in the next few weeks do n't fail to have a look at robert falls 's the <unk> at the goodman 
 if mr. wilbur 's translation is a <unk> ground lens through which we see the <unk> and corruption of <unk> paris mr. falls 's production is a mirror in which we see ourselves 
 mr. falls the goodman 's artistic director took a recent <unk> by neil bartlett and significantly adapted it 
 mr. bartlett had <unk> <unk> 's cast of characters to six and set them in the london media world of <unk> britain 
 mr. falls transfers the setting to hollywood and <unk> the characters into what passes for <unk> there agents producers actors writers and <unk> 
 it works 
 mr. bartlett managed to more or less maintain <unk> 's <unk> <unk> form N <unk> lines in <unk> <unk> 
 mr. falls kept the form but <unk> it with mr. bartlett 's further help 
 with a <unk> cast led by david <unk> as <unk> <unk> <unk> as <unk> and especially william brown as a <unk> who plays the hollywood game but harbors <unk> values and feelings the goodman production barrels through an <unk> hollywood party with <unk> and <unk> 
 if this version with its <unk> to steven <unk> <unk> and <unk> attracts younger audiences who might stay away from the classical version then messrs. bartlett and falls are justified in abandoning mr. wilbur 
 a <unk> play may be easier to revive than one merely N 
 the steppenwolf theatre company back from a critical and box office success in london with its <unk> of <unk> 's the <unk> of <unk> opened the new season with harold <unk> 's the <unk> first produced by the royal shakespeare company in N 
 back then mr. <unk> was not only the angry young british playwright but also the first to use <unk> and sentence <unk> and <unk> <unk> almost to the exclusion of what we previously understood to be theatrical dialogue 
 when the <unk> was first produced on this side of the atlantic actors and directors were <unk> 
 <unk> were lengthy nobody moved or <unk> 
 nobody <unk> <unk> and nobody in the audience was encouraged to <unk> 
 this kind of theater was new to us 
 also it was not a funny time over here what with the vietnam war the <unk> democratic convention assassinations and <unk> 
 but under jerry <unk> 's direction the current steppenwolf production scheduled to play through nov. N breaks through the flat and boring <unk> that the <unk> had become 
 led by a <unk> performance by alan wilder as max the father the play is at once an <unk> and <unk> <unk> of a family 's rage <unk> fear and <unk> 
 encouraged by mr. wilder 's <unk> <unk> embarrassed <unk> and <unk> <unk> the audience gets the joke and begins to <unk> before the end of the first act 
 three of the family members max and his two sons <unk> and <unk> live off the <unk> max is a retired butcher <unk> a <unk> and <unk> an <unk> <unk> 
 sam max 's brother has escaped the <unk> by working as a <unk> <unk> and never seeking a wife 
 teddy the <unk> of max 's sons has made the most dramatic escape by becoming a professor of philosophy at an american university 
 though it 's clearly max 's wife who held <unk> here until her death now none of the other male residents of this <unk> household can challenge max 
 the play concerns teddy 's <unk> with his wife of six years ruth 
 <unk> <unk> <unk> as teddy seems the only cast member unable to get beyond the <unk> approach to a <unk> character 
 as ruth <unk> harris a large and beautiful woman who may be our next <unk> <unk> begins almost immediately to <unk> each of the men 
 in the end teddy returns alone to america leaving ruth in max 's chair 
 we have seen her develop within a few hours from a shy and unknown <unk> to a <unk> of the <unk> who will replace the dead mother and then some 
 while steppenwolf was in london with the <unk> of <unk> bruce sagan the president of its board of directors quietly returned to chicago to buy a piece of real estate in the city 's rapidly <unk> north <unk> street restaurant and theater district 
 within a year he hopes steppenwolf will move into a new <unk> theater on that site 
 the <unk> currently <unk> in a converted dairy that seats N and provides little capacity for staging anything beyond a simple <unk> production 
 if we wanted to stage death of a salesman mr. sagan says <unk> <unk> would have to live in a ranch house because of the low ceiling 
 steppenwolf needs the extra seats even more than the fly space 
 it 's currently forced to turn away many potential subscribers beyond the N who can be <unk> in its present digs 
 for all the attention that chicago theater has received during the past decade not one new building has been devoted to it 
 mr. sagan a former publisher and real estate developer has put together an $ N million financial package that includes approximately $ N million of tax exempt bonds issued by the state of illinois the first time that a state has used its educational facilities authority to support construction of a theater and approximately $ N million in grants from the national <unk> for the arts the <unk> foundation and a few other deep pockets 
 the rest he is confident can be raised 
 his board members alone have pledged $ N and he is just beginning to massage local foundations and corporations 
 mr. sagan compares the importance of steppenwolf with <unk> <unk> 's mercury theater in the <unk> 
 but <unk> 's theater company turned out to have a brief one might say a <unk> existence 
 what will mr. sagan do with his new theater building if the <unk> of hollywood and broadway proves too much for such steppenwolf <unk> as john <unk> dangerous <unk> joan allen the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and the company <unk>

 as well <unk> and insurance brokerage companies will have improved profits 
 many investors expected damage from the hurricane to be the catalyst for higher rates in the industry which has been depressed because of low rates arising from intense competition 
 but mr. <unk> said the hurricane damage was n't extensive enough to prompt premium boosts 
 the companies just gave back what they had reserved for he said 
 now they 'll have to increase their <unk> to protect for the future and that means rate increases

 within minutes after the stock market closed friday i called sen. bill bradley of new jersey advised him that the dow jones industrial average had declined by N points late that afternoon and <unk> informed him that he and his fellow democrats were to blame 
 they had dealt a major setback that afternoon to president bush 's capital-gains tax cut proposal which had seemed in the bag after it passed the house <unk> earlier in the month 
 sen. bradley has it in his mind that such a tax cut would <unk> the tax reform he helped engineer in N 
 but he knows that as many as N of his fellow democrats are <unk> to vote for the cut popular among their constituents 
 as a result he took the lead in arguing that the cut should be blocked on procedural grounds 
 he helped persuade N of these senators to support him and majority leader george mitchell on these grounds 
 the budget reconciliation had to be dealt with by the oct. N deadline and these senate democrats refused to agree to allow a vote to <unk> capital gains to the budget bill knowing it would pass 
 denied a vote on substance the gop leadership in the senate on friday morning was confronted with a hard choice 
 it could throw in the towel and hope to win on capital gains late this month or it could follow the white house strategy to veto reconciliation unless capital gains was <unk> 
 the u.s. chamber of commerce has been in the <unk> in supporting the bush proposal 
 it endorsed the white house strategy <unk> it to be the <unk> way to victory 
 at noon friday a senior white house official advised richard <unk> the chamber 's chief economist that the white house would not agree to a budget reconciliation bill unless it had firm assurances that a vote on substance would be permitted in the senate 
 two hours later the first word emerged on capitol hill that the administration had agreed to reconciliation with no such assurances from senate democrats 
 mr. <unk> was shocked <unk> the office of richard darman director of the office of management and budget and the administration 's chief strategist on this issue 
 he left a message <unk> mr. darman of selling out 
 it was the senate republicans though who had edged away from the veto strategy 
 the stock market reacted as mr. <unk> did crumbling as it absorbed the news that mr. darman 's strategy had been abandoned 
 the stock market after all represents the collective expectations about the value of the future income stream of the nation 's capital stock discounted to present value 
 why should it be so surprising that a N N cut in the capital-gains tax would have such an enormous impact on the value of the nation 's capital stock 
 the total value of privately held assets is easily more than $ N trillion 
 the value traded on the exchanges is close to $ N trillion 
 if the tax on any gain to those assets was doubled would n't the value fall to the owners of the assets 
 is n't it reasonable to assume that the asset you own would be worth more if the government suddenly announced that if you sold it you would be able to keep N N more of its gain than you previously believed 
 indeed the stock market 's steady advance this year tracked with president bush 's success in advancing his capital-gains proposal 
 a N N cut in this year 's capital gains alone amounts to roughly $ N billion 
 we 're talking real money 
 when richard <unk> advised the financial press that the market crash was caused by the setback to capital gains he was generally ignored and mildly <unk> 
 instead the press corps readily accepted the notion that a <unk> in the takeover financing of united airlines instantly knocked N N off the value of the nation 's capital stock and caused <unk> around the world 
 mr. <unk> was pointing out an elephant <unk> through wall street while conventional wisdom had <unk> on the ual <unk> 
 why is this happening 
 for one thing quite a number of the leading spokesmen on wall street are not portfolio managers who understand that the value of assets is greatly affected by how government taxes those assets 
 they are economists and financial reporters who <unk> with the view that a capital-gains tax cut benefits the rich 
 yet they somehow think that wall street is <unk> to losing the tax cut that seemed so close friday morning and is now <unk> 
 the market rebound monday followed weekend assurances from mr. darman that the administration has other plans to win the cut which is alive and well 
 sen. bradley 's argument is that a capital-gains tax cut would be bad for the economy in the longer run 
 it would inevitably lead to an increase in marginal income-tax rates in N he thinks when the white house is forced to ask for higher taxes to meet budget targets 
 that is with capital gains cut the <unk> of the N accord will be gone and political realities will push up income-tax rates 
 the <unk> which he has heard is that if he and his fellow democrats are successful in killing the president 's proposal the revenue gap will open up <unk> in N because of the weakened economy 
 in this atmosphere there would be no serious consideration of tax increases 
 if sen. bradley would permit a vote on capital gains though it would pass christmas retail sales would be strong instead of <unk> by a falling stock market the N economy would be robust and the revenue gains at every level of government including new jersey 's would be surprisingly high 
 no tax increases would be necessary 
 the struggle over capital gains is the most important game in town 
 in washington and on wall street

 federal prosecutors said they have obtained a guilty plea from another person in the government 's ongoing probe of illegal payments in the record industry 
 william craig an independent record <unk> pleaded guilty to <unk> and criminal tax charges according to a statement issued by gary <unk> the u.s. attorney here

 the tva currently plans to issue a total of $ N billion in bonds to <unk> its high-interest debt

 the bond issue is tva 's first public offering since the financing bank was created in N primarily to finance the tva 
 but the offering almost did n't happen 
 the tva in fact decided to proceed with the bond offering following an agreement last week with the financing bank which allows tva to keep borrowing short term from the bank for two years after it goes to the public market 
 the treasury contended that tva could n't borrow from both it and the public debt market

 in one of the first <unk> <unk> cases to go to trial a <unk> jury decided in favor of the defendant burlington industries inc 
 the verdict reached late last week in cincinnati may end an <unk> legal battle for the <unk> n.c. carpet maker 
 glenn and sharon <unk> of cincinnati had sued the <unk> <unk> in N after <unk> burlington carpets in their office 
 the beebes alleged that toxic <unk> from the carpets made them sick 
 as a result of their illness the beebes said they lost $ N million in wages and earnings 
 in addition they said that months of exposure to the chemicals has left them sensitive to a wide range of commonly used <unk> 
 the case had been closely watched because attorneys anticipate increasing litigation nationally over the so-called <unk> syndrome 
 plaintiffs ' lawyers say that buildings become sick when inadequate fresh air and poor <unk> systems lead <unk> to build up inside 
 anthony j. <unk> a lawyer for burlington said the company believes the beebes ' symptoms were not related to the carpeting 
 he said that ill effects from new carpets <unk> themselves immediately but that the beebes ' symptoms appeared months later 
 <unk> adams the beebes ' lawyer said the verdict would not discourage other plaintiffs from filing such suits 
 scientists are only beginning to understand what causes <unk> syndrome and much of that research was unavailable when the beebes filed the case she said 
 the beebes now believe that a prime <unk> for their injuries was <unk> from an <unk> used in the carpeting 
 but the beebes did n't come to that conclusion until time limits had <unk> for adding the <unk> maker as a defendant in the case ms. adams said 
 the beebes have not yet decided whether to appeal

 a <unk> had initially refused the request ruling that the attack had been a political act for which the man <unk> <unk> <unk> would be exempt from <unk>

 the <unk> <unk> war when egypt <unk> into israel on oct. N N the <unk> day in the jewish calendar lasted barely a month 
 but one <unk> effect is still with us 
 the arab states always bitterly <unk> of u.s. support toward israel realized they held an <unk> weapon oil 
 early in october six arab nations in the persian gulf <unk> up prices sharply 
 on oct. N led by saudi arabia the world 's largest exporter they <unk> oil shipments to the u.s. and to the netherlands israel 's <unk> european ally 
 the timing was perfect 
 the arabs had tried <unk> before 
 in N when britain france and israel <unk> egypt to seize the suez <unk> arab producers cut off supplies to europe 
 texas simply pumped harder 
 u.s. oil supplies however had peaked in N and N and by N were declining 
 imports then six million barrels a day came primarily from venezuela and canada 
 but middle east supplies were growing in importance 
 by N the u.s. was bringing in two million barrels of arab oil a day more than N N of the N million barrels consumed daily 
 politics and economics conspired 
 japan and europe far more dependent on mideast oil than the u.s. would n't <unk> the arabs or trade off their precious supplies 
 the u.s. did manage to supply the dutch with oil by <unk> supplies once oil is shipped no one can tell its source 
 but <unk> americans <unk> and so did the u.s. and other <unk> governments

 at bear stearns cos. for example the N executive officers led by chairman alan <unk> greenberg got a pay increase to $ N million for the <unk> period ended june N from $ N million for the N months ended april N N 
 the figures do n't include substantial dividends on holdings of bear stearns stock 
 mr. greenberg himself was paid $ N million before an estimated $ N million in dividends up from $ N million the year before 
 the increase is noted in the brokerage firm 's latest proxy statement filed with the securities and exchange commission 
 because it operates on a fiscal year bear stearns 's yearly filings are available much earlier than those of other firms 
 the latest period includes N months instead of N because bear stearns changed to a fiscal year ending in june instead of april 
 meanwhile bear stearns 's N stock and bond salesmen saw <unk> <unk> over the past year which the company says reflected lower commission revenue caused by a decline in investor activity in the markets 
 however bear stearns on monday reported improved earnings for its first quarter ended sept. N partly because of a N N increase in commissions during the quarter 
 william j. <unk> chief financial officer defended the <unk> salaries at bear stearns 
 all of us are on a base salary of $ N if the firm makes nothing and that 's pretty low as far as wall street goes mr. <unk> said 
 however bear stearns has never had an unprofitable year since its founding N years ago 
 four bear stearns executives besides the <unk> mr. greenberg were paid $ N million or more before dividends for the N months ended in june 
 according to the proxy statement james e. <unk> N bear stearns 's president made $ N million an executive vice president michael l. <unk> N made nearly $ N million and two executive vice presidents vincent j. <unk> N and william j. <unk> N made about $ N million each

 morgan grenfell group plc said john craven group chief executive officer is taking over the <unk> of the merchant banking group from sir peter <unk> who is retiring 
 mr. <unk> will remain a member of the merchant bank 's board 
 mr. craven is widely credited with <unk> morgan grenfell 's <unk> on its core corporate finance fund management and banking activities over the past year 
 last year morgan grenfell shut down its ailing u.k. securities operations 
 mr. craven said his move to the <unk> means he will take a less active role in the day-to-day management of the group but he added that the merchant bank 's strategic focus remains unchanged 
 mr. craven joined morgan grenfell as group chief executive in may N a few months after the resignations of former chief executive christopher <unk> and other top officials because of the merchant bank 's role in guinness plc 's controversial takeover of <unk> 's co. in N 
 morgan grenfell had advised guinness on the bid which was surrounded by allegations that guinness used <unk> means to support the bid 's value 
 morgan grenfell said michael <unk> currently group deputy chief executive will assume the chief executive position 
 the merchant bank also announced that finance director david <unk> is taking early retirement for personal reasons 
 his duties will be taken over by anthony <unk> who has been elected deputy chairman 
 news of mr. <unk> 's retirement comes one day after morgan said that christopher whittington resigned as chairman of morgan 's banking subsidiary to join a financial services firm 
 mr. craven said both messrs. <unk> and whittington had planned to leave the bank earlier but mr. craven had persuaded them to remain until the bank was in a healthy position 
 if there 's any <unk> about the departures it 's that they are leaving at a time when the business is in reasonably good shape and going forward very well

 par a <unk> maker that has been plagued by management problems was already the subject of a federal criminal inquiry into the <unk> process and a food and drug administration investigation 
 a par spokesman said he understood the criminal investigation in maryland <unk> to matters par disclosed in july when par said it filed false drug information with the fda 
 at the time the company said it was <unk> one of its drugs and had stopped selling two others 
 the spokesman said he also understood that the inquiry related to the existence of an <unk> production book

 just after midnight monday federal spending started to drop by $ N billion 
 what do you say we all close down the <unk> game go home and bank the $ N billion 
 that 's essentially what budget director richard darman is suggesting and we think he deserves as much support as he can get 
 if human beings ca n't cut federal spending <unk> and they ca n't let the computers do it 
 congress with a measure of white house <unk> has been <unk> the spending accounts for years under the cover of omnibus appropriations bills 
 indeed without earlier <unk> the current sequester of $ N billion would have been even larger 
 we suspect voters are fed up with the <unk> 
 consider for instance that even yesterday 's widely publicized sequester is likely to be <unk> if business as usual is allowed to prevail 
 under the law gramm-rudman 's <unk> in federal programs are supposed to be permanent 
 social security and spending for poor people are <unk> 
 however the associated press 's account of the monday sequester order signed by president bush neatly captured the <unk> congress shows toward the notion of a legally <unk> commitment 
 lawmakers have been saying for weeks that they plan to roll back the cuts as soon as they agree to a compromise on a <unk> bill 
 mr. darman 's <unk> to save the sequester was backed up yesterday by white house press secretary marlin fitzwater 
 there is some feeling here that the cuts are the way to go 
 it will reduce spending in a very effective fashion 
 this attitude is being <unk> away by <unk> around washington as little more than tough talk 
 it looks to us like a golden opportunity for george bush to <unk> off at the <unk> all this talk about a <unk> <unk> presidency 
 mr. bush would be acting in the public interest if he let the washington <unk> who manipulate these budgets the bureaucrats the lobbyists the congressional staffers live for just one year on a restricted diet 
 ask <unk> <unk> thin is in 
 senator phil <unk> pointed out monday that in the N years before gramm-rudman was enacted in N federal spending grew by about N N a year since the law it 's grown at under N N annually 
 another major factor in this positive trend was ronald reagan 's decision early in his presidency to fight the budget war on the expenditure side rather than raising taxes 
 george bush 's continued support of the tax dam <unk> this strategy of <unk> congress to make choices among competing priorities rather than just saying yes to all the <unk> special-interest <unk> that fill the <unk> trough 
 if washington 's <unk> ever succeed in <unk> the tax dam americans will be <unk> in a red sea of new spending programs such as <unk> child care 
 child care was one of the many <unk> bills pulled out of the senate 's reconciliation bill last friday 
 others were the capital-gains cut section N repeal the disabled workers bill and the unprecedented <unk> of the catastrophic health act 
 all this stuff still is in the house 's <unk> reconciliation bill and many members say they 're reluctant to pull out <unk> bills just to see them die 
 republicans especially want a guarantee from the house leadership that they 'll get an <unk> vote on the bills 
 house speaker foley ought to deliver that promise 
 this is the way government is supposed to work with politicians taking responsibility for votes that their constituents can identify instead of <unk> them in the great reconciliation garbage truck 
 we have as much <unk> as anyone for those <unk> <unk> days in washington when <unk> men and women <unk> over budgets and even <unk> a bit to see that the bridges got build roads <unk> soldiers paid or that the desperately poor were <unk> for 
 those days are gone 
 nor do we see any reason to believe that a metropolitan washington that has gotten fat and rich and <unk> in the shadow of the federal <unk> will change much on its own initiative 
 save the sequester and let washington <unk>

 nothing has changed fundamentally in the tokyo market

 the stock market 's dizzying gyrations during the past few days have made a lot of individual investors wish they could buy some sort of insurance 
 after all they wo n't soon forget the stock bargains that became available after the october N crash 
 but while they want to be on the alert for similar buying opportunities now they 're afraid of being <unk> by another <unk> plunge 
 the solution at least for some investors may be a hedging technique that 's well known to players in the <unk> market 
 called a married put the technique is carried out by purchasing a stock and simultaneously buying a put option on that stock 
 it 's like fire insurance says harrison roth the senior options strategist at <unk> & co 
 because a put option gives its owner the right but not the obligation to sell a fixed number of shares of the stock at a stated price on or before the option 's expiration date the investor is protected against a sudden drop in the stock 's price 
 but most investment advisers do n't recommend using married puts all the time 
 that 's because the cost of buying put options <unk> into an investor 's profit when stock prices rise 
 this is the type of fire insurance you only buy when the nearby woods are on fire says mr. roth 
 you always want your house insured but you do n't always feel the need for your investments to be insured 
 in addition to hedging new stock purchases the <unk> technique can be used to protect stocks that an investor already owns 
 in either case the investor faces three possible <unk> 
 if the stock goes up in price between now and the put 's expiration date the put will probably expire <unk> 
 the investor will be out the cost of the put which is called the premium and this loss will reduce the stock-market profit 
 if the stock stays at the same price between now and the put 's expiration date the investor 's loss will be limited to the cost of the put less any amount realized from a closing sale of the put 
 the <unk> scenario would be if the put expires <unk> 
 if the price of the stock declines the put will increase in value 
 once the stock price is less than the exercise price or strike price of the put the gain will match the loss on the stock dollar for dollar 
 the put <unk> a minimum selling price for the stock during its life 
 when a stock falls below the put 's strike price the investor simply sells the stock at a loss and simultaneously sells the put at a profit 
 or the investor can exercise the put by <unk> the stock to his or her broker in return for payment from another investor who has sold a put on the same stock 
 brokers handle such transactions through the options clearing corp. which guarantees all option trades 
 the accompanying table shows how this strategy would work for three stocks 
 though not reflected in the table an investor should know that the cost of the option insurance can be partially offset by any dividends that the stock pays 
 for example tenneco inc. pays a quarterly dividend of N cents which would be received before the february option expires and thus reduce the cost of using the technique by that amount 
 in this case the investor 's risk would n't exceed N N of the total investment 
 to <unk> the calculations commissions on the option and underlying stock are n't included in the table 
 there are more than N stocks on which options may be bought and sold including some over-the-counter stocks 
 but some investors might prefer a simpler strategy then hedging their individual holdings 
 they can do this by purchasing index puts which are simply put options on indexes that match broad baskets of stocks 
 for instance the most popular index option is the s&p N option commonly called the <unk> 
 it is based on the stocks that make up standard & poor 's <unk> index 
 unlike options on individual issues index options are settled only in cash and no stock is ever tendered 
 but while index options are convenient they have several <unk> 
 for one thing an investor 's portfolio might not closely match the s&p N 
 as a result the <unk> insurance may or may not fully protect an investor 's holdings in the event of a market decline 
 in addition <unk> options were suspended from trading last friday afternoon after the stock-market sell-off got under way and trading in the <unk> futures contract was halted 
 so an investor who wanted to realize a profit on <unk> puts after the trading suspension would have been out of luck 
 on the other hand only a handful of individual issues were suspended from trading on friday 
 normally once the underlying investment is suspended from trading the options on those investments also do n't trade 
 ultimately whether the insurance provided by purchasing puts is <unk> depends on the cost of the options 
 that cost rises in times of high market volatility 
 but it still might be cheaper than taking a major hit 
 the protection from using married puts is clearly superior to that <unk> by another options strategy some investors consider using during troubled times selling call options on stocks the investor owns 
 a call option is similar to a put except that it gives its owner the right to buy shares at a stated price until expiration 
 selling a call option gives an investor a small buffer against a stock-market decline 
 that 's because it reduces the cost of the stock by the amount of premium received from the sale of the call 
 but if the price of the stock rises above the strike price of the option the stock is almost certain to be called away 
 and in that case the investor misses out on any major upside gain 
 these calculations exclude the effect of commissions paid and dividends received from the stock 
 all prices are as of monday 's close 
 hopes for quick enactment of pending deficit-reduction legislation faded as efforts to streamline the house version in advance of a house-senate conference broke down 
 house leaders had hoped to follow the senate 's lead by getting an agreement from house committee chairmen under which they would drop items that would n't reduce the fiscal N budget deficit from the house-passed bill before the negotiations with the senate began 
 but the effort became <unk> on the question of what would become of other issues ranging from cutting the capital-gains tax to child care to repeal of <unk> insurance 
 many members feel there are important features of the house bill that should be enacted speaker thomas foley d. wash said 
 if there is any support for reducing the bill it is <unk> on their desire to see them passed in another form 
 now those items will be discussed in a house-senate conference which could begin as soon as today with the expectation that they could either be resolved there or placed into other legislation 
 you 've got to give these chairmen the opportunity to see if they can work things out said house budget committee chairman leon <unk> d. calif 
 this is a democratic process you ca n't <unk> anything around here 
 white house budget director richard darman has said he would continue to press to keep the capital-gains provision in the final version of the bill unless the house drops many of its costly provisions 
 senate leaders had hoped to be able to send a compromise version of the measure to president bush by the end of the week but speaker foley said that was n't likely 
 failure to pass the bill meant that $ N billion in across-the-board spending cuts took effect monday under the gramm-rudman budget law 
 the bill must be enacted before the cuts can be restored

 a surprising surge in the u.s. trade deficit raised fears that the nation 's export drive has stalled and caused new turmoil in financial markets 
 the merchandise trade deficit widened in august to $ N billion the commerce department reported a sharp deterioration from july 's $ N billion and the largest deficit of any month this year 
 exports fell for the second month in a row while imports rose to a record 
 this is one of the worst trade releases we 've had since the dollar <unk> out in N said <unk> dennis chief international economist at james capel inc 
 like most analysts mr. dennis was <unk> to read too much into one month 's numbers but he said it indicates perhaps that the balance in the u.s. economy is not as good as we 've been led to believe 
 the number had a troubling effect on wall street suggesting that more fundamental economic problems may <unk> last friday 's stock market slide 
 the dow jones industrial average tumbled more than N points after the report 's release before recovering to close N points lower at N 
 this bad trade number raises some deeper issues about the market decline said norman robertson chief economist for mellon bank 
 it raises questions about more <unk> problems the budget deficit and the trade deficit and the <unk> lack of ability to come to <unk> with them 
 the trade report drew yet another <unk> parallel to october N 
 on oct. N of that year the announcement of an unusually large august trade deficit helped trigger a steep market decline 
 the slide continued until the record <unk> market drop on oct. N 
 in N however the news was the latest in a string of disappointments on trade while the current report comes after a period of improvement 
 the bleak trade report was played down by the bush administration 
 commerce secretary robert mosbacher called the worsening trade figures disappointing after two very good months 
 and white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the deficit was an unwelcome increase adding that we 're hopeful that it simply is a <unk> situation and will turn around 
 but the figures reinforced the view of many private analysts that the improvement in the u.s. trade deficit has run out of steam 
 the figures today add further evidence to support the view that the improvement in the u.s. trade deficit has essentially stalled out at a level of about a $ N billion annual rate said jeffrey scott a research fellow at the institute for international economics here 
 that 's still an improvement over last year but it leads one to conclude that basically we 've gotten all the <unk> we can out of past dollar depreciation and past marginal cuts in the federal budget deficit 
 exports declined for the second consecutive month in august slipping N N to $ N billion the commerce department reported 
 imports on the other hand leaped N N to a record $ N billion 
 not only was august 's deficit far worse than july 's but the government revised the july figure substantially from the $ N billion deficit it had initially reported last month 
 many economists contend that deep cuts in the u.s. budget deficit are needed before further trade improvement can occur 
 that 's because the budget deficit feeds an enormous appetite in this country for both foreign goods and foreign capital overwhelming the nation 's capacity to export 
 people are sick and tired of hearing about these deficits but the imbalances are still there and they are still a problem said mr. robertson 
 in addition the rise in the value of the dollar against foreign currencies over the past several months has increased the price of u.s. products in overseas markets and hurt the country 's competitiveness 
 since march exports have been virtually flat 
 at the same time william t. <unk> international vice president at the u.s. chamber of commerce notes clearly the stronger dollar has made imports more attractive by causing their prices to decline 
 most economists expect the slowing u.s. economy to curb demand for imports 
 but they <unk> little substantial progress in exports unless the dollar and the federal budget deficit come down 
 the best result we could get from these numbers would be to see the administration and congress get serious about putting the u.s. on an internationally competitive economic footing said howard lewis vice president of international economic affairs at the national association of manufacturers 
 that must start with cutting the federal budget deficit 
 august 's decline in exports reflected <unk> in sales of industrial supplies capital goods and food abroad and increases in sales of motor vehicles parts and engines 
 the jump in imports stemmed from across-the-board increases in purchases of foreign goods 
 the numbers were adjusted for usual seasonal fluctuations

 steve jobs took a step back from the <unk> of personal-computer technology in an effort to spur sales of next inc. 's new machine 
 mr. jobs moved to remedy a couple of his computer 's <unk> yesterday by lowering the <unk> price for a next machine by $ N or N N if the buyer chooses a hard-disk drive as an alternative to next 's <unk> device 
 the hard drive which is the storage device of choice for virtually every desktop computer user also now will supplement next 's <unk> optical device if buyers pay full price 
 mr. jobs <unk> of apple computer inc. founded next four years ago in the hopes of <unk> a revolution in the way desktop computers are designed and used 
 his next computer introduced about a year ago and aimed primarily at university computer users sports <unk> graphics digital sound <unk> <unk> and a <unk> black design 
 but the computer was proving a hard sell because of its high price a lack of software and an optical <unk> device that was too slow 
 the machine began shipping at the end of last year 
 the closely held company has n't disclosed sales 
 however most universities that have bought the machines say they are buying small numbers for evaluation purposes 
 universities can now buy a next computer without an optical storage device for $ N 
 a computer with the optical device will still cost $ N but from now on next will outfit every computer with a hard drive and supply one at no cost to those who have already bought next machines 
 commercial customers can purchase the same system through businessland inc. a computer retailer based in san jose calif. for roughly $ N more 
 mr. jobs said the changes were prompted by requests from customers who are frustrated with the performance of the optical device which is n't offered as standard equipment by any rivals 
 another factor was that customers were asking why do n't you give us a cheaper system mr. jobs said at a conference on university computing here 
 <unk> devices can handle very large amounts of data and make it far easier to <unk> film <unk> or audio <unk> with a computer 
 but the technology while <unk> is far slower than the widely used hard drives 
 to get around the delays caused by the optical device businessland which is next 's exclusive dealer to corporations has for months been advising customers to purchase hard drives with the machines 
 next 's decision to rely on the <unk> hard drive in every next computer does n't signal a retreat from optical storage said mr. jobs who for years has said this technology will play a crucial role in the next decade 
 we 're extremely committed to optical storage technology he said 
 we think everything will go this way in a few years 
 he said that the next generation of optical drives will be as fast as hard drives but he depends on outside suppliers for the devices 
 but university computer specialists who welcomed the move called it a necessary retreat from the cutting edge of technology and one that 's likely to increase next 's sales on <unk> 
 from the standpoint of being on the <unk> of technology this is a step <unk> said jerry w. <unk> a senior computing manager for the california state university system 
 but it will definitely boost next 's sales 
 universities however say next 's prices must go even lower before large numbers of students purchase the machine 
 we 'd still like to see a student model priced at about $ N said ronald johnson director of academic computing at minnesota 's <unk> <unk> college which has bought eight next machines 
 broad acceptance of next 's computer also is <unk> by difficulty in distributing software for it 
 most software is distributed on cheap <unk> disks but the next computer does n't come with a device that reads them 
 next 's computer also needs more software applications but mr. jobs said he expects more soon 
 he said he expects lotus development corp. to introduce a next version of its popular N <unk> program in N 
 educators added that next needs to soon offer a color version of its computer 
 every major maker offers computers with color displays 
 next wo n't comment on when it will do the same but is believed to have a color model under development

 he succeeds as president don <unk> who remains chairman and chief executive officer 
 the position of chief operating officer is new 
 <unk> corp. reported a net loss of $ N million or N cents a share for the third quarter which was <unk> by severance costs and the expense of upgrading its <unk> software inventories 
 the software company said revenue slid N N to $ N million 
 this contrasts with the year-ago quarter when the company had net income of $ N million or N cents a share on revenue of $ N million 
 for the nine months <unk> had a loss of $ N million or $ N a share 
 in the year-ago period the company had profit of $ N million or $ N a share 
 revenue in the period slid almost N N to $ N million from about $ N million last year 
 edward m. <unk> chairman president and chief executive officer attributed the decline to reduced domestic revenue because of $ N million spent to upgrade existing software inventories to the new <unk> <unk> version N and $ N million spent on the recent reduction in work force 
 he said the company was encouraged by <unk> it received from selected customers now testing version N 
 the red ink came as no surprise to wall street but analysts said they saw <unk> hints of a further delay in volume shipments of version N a <unk> of continued losses in the fourth quarter 
 the loss is in line with our expectations said john c. maxwell iii an analyst with dillon read & co. in new york 
 he added gross margins and operating profit eroded quite dramatically from the prior quarter along with sales of existing software product lines like <unk> and <unk> 
 the success of a new product in the <unk> line is needed 
 and while the company has n't made a <unk> statement it now looks like that 's not going to be anytime soon mr. maxwell said 
 the company said in a statement that it expects to ship new products during the next two quarters 
 it now looks like <unk> <unk> version N is n't going to be widely available until the first quarter of N said david <unk> an analyst with montgomery securities in san francisco 
 this is the second delay now in getting the product out the door 
 it does <unk> the pain somewhat 
 mr. maxwell said unless the company can start shipments of the new product sometime this quarter the fourth-quarter loss is likely to be comparable to the third quarter 's 
 if the company can start to ship during this quarter it could stem some if not all of the red ink he said

 these two new crowd families lived in the same apartment building with the <unk> <unk> <unk> on top of the gutfreund <unk> 
 the <unk> <unk> started up from the gutfreund landing and susan gutfreund used to turn off its light to give the impression that there was no higher floor 
 eventually mr. <unk> broke his <unk> in the dark 
 then the <unk> determined to put up a <unk> christmas tree weighing a quarter of a ton to <unk> their holiday guests 
 for this a crane needed to be mounted on the <unk> ' <unk> 
 the <unk> did not give permission 
 but the gutfreund workers went ahead anyway only to be captured in <unk> by joan <unk> who called the police 
 before the <unk> finally left this unfriendly environment for a <unk> <unk> on fifth avenue and an <unk> mansion with a specially <unk> $ N million garage in paris the <unk> had obtained an injunction to prevent any future <unk> of trees and in a <unk> spirit hit both the <unk> and the building with a $ N million lawsuit 
 nothing less it seemed could <unk> them for their <unk> 
 where had all the money come from 
 the young john gutfreund had been discovered by <unk> salomon of salomon bros. when he was still a <unk> liberal and put to work as a trader and then as a <unk> <unk> 
 get off your he would <unk> say the authors 
 rising in the firm he became powerful and <unk> though his new wife susan made him <unk> in the <unk> columns with her <unk> spending habits and flamboyant <unk> 
 after he had been head of the company for N N years he and his partners sold it to <unk> a powerful commodity trading outfit for $ N million in <unk> stock 
 limited partner <unk> salomon whose family name had been on the firm 's door for N years and who had hoped it would be there forever was not <unk> 
 mr. gutfreund collected $ N million while <unk> salomon got $ N million much less than if he had conducted the sale 
 i felt <unk> he later said 
 worse salomon 's timing had been off 
 its profits unlike <unk> 's soared over the next two years and had it held out salomon could have gotten an even bigger <unk> 
 the book also <unk> the not <unk> <unk> surrounding the changing of the guard at lehman bros. and other grand old firms 
 often the <unk> conservative <unk> investment bankers were <unk> by crude traders when angered he <unk> so <unk> that his face <unk> and his <unk> eyes narrowed into tiny <unk> the authors say of lehman 's lewis <unk> 
 the earlier generation of our crowd bankers <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> had stressed above all <unk> tradition <unk> and reputation 
 they were old-fashioned elegant <unk> who happened to be of german jewish <unk> 
 but in the harsh world of today 's wall street they have lost out to more aggressive and sometimes less <unk> <unk> 
 the <unk> prefers the <unk> of other birds and <unk> out their eggs 
 but the old guard hired the new crowd people it brought in its own <unk> 
 so as the old crowd <unk> from the branch it should n't have been too surprised 
 the old guard had every right however to <unk> the newcomers ' new ways of making money such as <unk> 
 a fortune article on saul steinberg was entitled fear and <unk> in the corporate <unk> 
 their other <unk> has been corporate takeovers often hostile and financed by junk bonds 
 hostile takeovers are quite a new phenomenon 
 sometimes they are <unk> but often not 
 first by making management focus on short-term results they inhibit building for the future just the opposite of japan 
 second a long-term shareholder of a good company need n't worry too much when the stock price drops temporarily it will bounce back 
 but if a raider takes over when the stock is weak the shareholder never gets his recovery 
 the raiders meanwhile have <unk> their own pattern for spending their new millions 
 as described in the new crowd they take on ambitious new wives move to greenwich conn. or <unk> n.y. buy ok pictures and let their wives share the wealth with <unk> 
 having donated heavily to <unk> they demand a place on their boards 
 the book is <unk> about this <unk> <unk> struggle for respectability which has its <unk> aspects 
 however on balance the charity game helps america 
 if those who have the money do n't get involved with the <unk> and the charities then city hall will do it badly 
 it has been <unk> observed that the main thing wrong with tainted money is <unk> ai <unk> enough of it 
 a handful of the new crowd operators have crossed the line from the <unk> to the illegal and have ended up in the <unk> or paying huge fines 
 ivan boesky dennis levine martin <unk> victor and steven posner and now michael <unk> and perhaps <unk> helmsley 
 the <unk> office that ivan boesky vacated for a prison cell had previously contained commodity operators marc rich and <unk> green today <unk> from a potential century apiece of jail sentences 
 the old crowd is deeply concerned by the backlash from all this 
 however the phenomenon is not specifically jewish 
 it has always been true that those outside the club want to climb in and that a few will cut corners in the process 
 some pretty <unk> stuff built the <unk> families ' fifth avenue and newport <unk> and <unk> their daughters ' <unk> to foreign <unk> 
 mr. boesky was a <unk> compared to jay gould and jim <unk> and commodore <unk> thought nothing of <unk> judges and legislators 
 so who knows 
 in a generation or two some of the new crowd may <unk> true respectability perhaps to be <unk> in turn by a later <unk> of unscrupulous <unk>

 in august soon after wang laboratories inc. reported a staggering $ N million loss and replaced its president two boston sales representatives sent customers a letter saying we fully expect that you will soon be reading stories in the press reporting the amazing comeback at wang 
 how soon wang will stage a comeback or if it will at all are still matters of debate 
 but wang salespeople are trying to cope with the biggest challenge any marketer can face selling the products of a company that is on the ropes 
 if your prospect is feeling risk the whole time and you 're not feeling as if you 're backed up by a stable company you 've lost it before you 've begun says mary ann <unk> a <unk> mass. sales <unk> and consultant who works with high technology companies 
 it can happen in any industry 
 consider the difficulties faced by <unk> salespeople when the car was tainted by false charges of sudden acceleration or exxon dealers ' problems in the wake of the <unk> oil spill 
 like thousands of salespeople before them wang 's are finding ways to combat the bad news 
 it 's very important that we <unk> confidence even though within the family we know there 's a lot of hard work ahead said richard miller the <unk> mass. computer concern 's new president in a video message to salespeople a month after he took over 
 wang got into financial trouble because of bloated overhead and overly optimistic sales forecasts 
 its <unk> minicomputers and word processors have lost ground to cheaper personal computers 
 last year it funded its high employment by heavy borrowing and it suffered huge losses when sales turned down instead of rising 
 after the company reported red ink for the fiscal third quarter wang 's marketing department provided the sales force answers to questions such as how could you not have known you were going to lose $ N million and is wang still a viable company 
 salespeople try to push their products and avoid discussions of finances 
 responding to such questions is defensive says kenneth <unk> wang 's vice president marketing 
 that 's <unk> to the art of selling 
 moreover he notes that analyzing financial results <unk> a problem for a salesman who is n't particularly familiar with a balance sheet 
 at one sales strategy meeting an executive suggested ordering salespeople to become experts on the annual report 
 mr. miller vetoed that even i ca n't understand all the <unk> he says 
 instead he says if the salespeople can get the customers to consider wang 's products on their merits he or a top financial officer will try to <unk> the fears about finances 
 mike <unk> a salesman in wang 's austin texas office has a <unk> method we tell them $ N billion companies do n't go out of business 
 we tell them all the major companies are having financial difficulties 
 numerous computer companies are having sales <unk> and earnings declines but very few have had losses comparable to wang 's or are carrying such a large debt load 
 mr. miller says that after a sharp sales slump in july and august sales stabilized in september 
 although wang will report a loss for the first quarter ended sept. N and the full fiscal year mr. miller says he expects the company will return to profitability by the fourth quarter 
 experts on sales technique say anyone representing a troubled company must walk a fine line 
 if a salesman <unk> his credibility in this time of trouble it will be a problem for the long run says george <unk> a <unk> nev. sales consultant and author of the marketing edge 
 still says john sullivan a management <unk> with daniel roberts inc. of boston who has held senior sales positions at polaroid and <unk> the customer will react to strength 
 ignore the present condition 
 show it 's business as usual 
 that is n't easy 
 wang 's customers are data processing managers who want to be sure that their suppliers are stable <unk> companies that will be around to fix bugs and upgrade computers for years to come 
 for buyers these are <unk> decisions says jean <unk> who <unk> a network of wang computers in the <unk> department at boston university 
 the university is considering <unk> a $ N system to store applications electronically 
 before the really bad news we were looking at wang fairly seriously she says 
 but their present financial condition means i 'd have a hard time convincing the vice president in charge of purchasing 
 ms. <unk> adds at some point we 'd have to ask how do we know that in three years you wo n't be in chapter N 
 during the past year wang has developed new products and a new strategy and hired a new president 
 wang 's overall product line is still not as good as other vendors but they 've come a long way says steven <unk> a consultant with market researcher gartner group stamford conn 
 they were on the road to recovery in terms of customer attitudes until this bad quarter happened 
 the first priority for wang 's sales force is to make sure it holds on to existing customers 
 wang 's installed base is one of its greatest assets and many of those customers remain extremely loyal 
 but even before wang 's latest financial troubles surfaced some customers were trying to wall off their wang installations so other departments would n't add wang says chris <unk> a former wang marketer who is now a market analyst with <unk> group a market research firm in stamford conn 
 one wang salesman who left the company in july recalls that when he tried to sell products to eastman kodak he worked to <unk> support from internal allies but those allies became skeptical as they saw the <unk> 
 the more recent losses were really devastating 
 new customers the source of higher commissions for salespeople and the key to wang 's long-term viability are even tougher 
 rick lynch a former top salesman in wang 's boston office referring to wang 's mainstay computer line says you ca n't sell a <unk> to a new customer 
 mr. lynch left wang this summer for <unk> systems inc. a software vendor 
 the financial problems are particularly frustrating for salespeople pushing wang 's image systems which convert paper forms to electronic documents 
 consultants say that wang 's technology is among the best available in the image market 
 but salespeople often found that news of wang 's problems <unk> their sales efforts 
 william <unk> a former sales manager in indianapolis says that his office had all but sold a $ N million image system to pharmaceutical maker eli lilly & co 
 when they were making the decision all hell broke loose with the finances 
 he says the lilly executives told him they could n't take the risk with wang 
 mr. <unk> say he does n't blame lilly 
 buyers have to rely on a supplier continually upgrading and replacing the product he says 
 when a company <unk> that it 's hard to go with wang 
 for mr. <unk> who says he used to earn as much as $ N a year at wang it was one more reason to quit 
 he is now president of <unk> homes inc. an indianapolis contractor 
 it can be hard for a <unk> to fight off feelings of <unk> 
 brian <unk> a former wang salesman in <unk> new york says you have pride in your job 
 you think you can go out and turn things around 
 it 's a tough thing when you ca n't 
 the reason does n't <unk> to your selling skills 
 <unk> feeds on itself 
 the problem is if people get down in the <unk> they stop selling says mike <unk> a <unk> sales manager in wang 's austin office 
 one key for salespeople is to boost their own morale 
 paul <unk> a <unk> mass. sales and management consultant and author of ready aim you 're hired says the bad news is you 'll be rejected more 
 the good news is it 's not your fault 
 so he advises make goals <unk> 
 for instance he suggests that salespeople making telephone calls should say to themselves all i want to do today is get N <unk> 
 but mr. miller wang 's new president recently warned his salespeople about <unk> 
 our customers watch us for the hidden message he said 
 look a customer right in the eye and say i 'm glad to be at wang 
 <unk> international enterprises inc. the parent of beleaguered <unk> <unk> robinson & co. said its shareholders approved a previously announced name change to <unk> enterprises inc
