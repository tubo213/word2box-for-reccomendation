 it also faces numerous other hurdles including an agreement on a pipeline route for the gas 
 the board said the export licenses would be issued on the condition that canadian interests would also be allowed to bid for the mackenzie delta gas on terms similar to those offered to u.s. customers 
 u.s. buyers have already been lined up 
 they include enron corp. texas eastern corp. pacific interstate transmission co. and tennessee gas pipeline co 
 the project could result in the u.s. taking more than N N of its natural gas supplies from canada up from about N N currently 
 it would bring N gas fields into production at a combined rate of about N billion cubic feet a day 
 the board estimated that the cost of building a pipeline from the mackenzie delta to alberta would be about c$ N million

 where do americans put their money 
 it depends on when you look 
 in N for instance less than N N of assets went into bank deposits 
 that rose to nearly N N during the depression and has n't changed much since 
 pension reserves on the other hand made up a relatively small part of household assets until the last decade when they skyrocketed 
 and there has been a drastic decline in the importance of <unk> business assets thanks to industry consolidation and a decline in family farms 
 that 's some of what emerges from the following charts which show how americans have changed their investment patterns over the past N years 
 some results are <unk> 
 but other figures are surprising 
 housing for instance has remained a fairly steady component of household assets over the past decade although common wisdom would have expected an increase 
 there is a lot of attention paid to housing as a form of household wealth says edward n. <unk> professor of economics at new york university 
 but it has n't increased much relative to other assets 
 it suggests that households <unk> wealth across a broad spectrum of assets 
 and housing though it appears in the popular mind as being the major growing household asset is n't 
 in addition investors ' desire to hold stocks directly and through mutual funds has held surprisingly steady stocks ' importance among assets largely reflects the ups and <unk> of the stock market and not a shift in <unk> preferences 
 stocks have not spread to the general public despite the fact that the environment is much different concludes robert avery an economist at cornell university 
 to me it says that despite all the views that we spend too much of our wealth on paper assets we have ways of holding wealth similar to N years ago

 mccaw is seeking N N of the cellular and broadcasting concern the revised offer includes a feature requiring mccaw to begin an auction process in july N that would buy out remaining holders at a per-share price roughly equivalent to what a third party might then have to pay for all of lin 
 the letter <unk> broad powers for an independent group of directors provided for in the revised offer

 mccaw said the three independent directors provided for in the offer would be designated by the current board 
 the <unk> would be <unk> by the independent directors 
 lin would have a priority right to pursue all opportunities to acquire u.s. cellular interests in markets other than those in which mccaw holds an interest or which are <unk> to those markets unless lin has an interest there or <unk> to it 
 independent directors would have veto rights to any acquisition if they unanimously decide it is n't in lin 's best interest 
 independent directors would be able to block transactions they unanimously <unk> would be likely to depress the private market value of lin at the time it is to be sold in five years 
 if lin is put up for sale rather than purchased by mccaw in five years mccaw wo n't submit a bid unless the independent directors request it and the independent directors will run the bidding 
 the directors would be able to sell particular assets to enable such buyers as the regional bell operating companies to purchase the company 's interests

 the company cited higher tax credits in the second quarter totaling $ N million compared with $ N million in the third quarter 
 excluding tax credits profit was N N below the second quarter 
 but that drop was caused entirely by a decline in brazilian interest paid to $ N million from $ N million the second quarter 
 moreover bankamerica continued to build its reserve against troubled foreign loans by boosting its loan-loss provision to $ N million about the same as the previous quarter but well above the $ N million in the year-earlier quarter 
 the provision rate was far above bankamerica 's actual net credit losses of $ N million in the third quarter compared with $ N million in the second period and $ N million a year earlier 
 as a result bankamerica said its reserve against troubled <unk> loans once below N N now amounts to N N of the $ N billion of <unk> debt it <unk> it is owed by those nations 
 that level is about the same as some other big banks but far below the N N and N N reserves of bankers trust new york corp. and j.p. morgan & co. respectively 
 by any measure third-quarter earnings were still robust equivalent to a N N return on assets even excluding tax credits 
 by that key measure of operating efficiency bankamerica turned in a better performance than its <unk> los angeles-based competitor security pacific corp. which posted a N N return in the third quarter 
 but it continued to badly trail its san francisco neighbor wells fargo & co. which reported an extraordinary N N return on assets 
 both returns do n't include any tax credits 
 they bankamerica continue to show good performance said donald k. <unk> an analyst with <unk> <unk> & woods inc. san francisco 
 in composite trading yesterday on the new york stock exchange bankamerica common stock edged up N cents to close at $ N a share 
 shareholder equity improved to N N from N N in the previous quarter 
 the N N net interest margin or the difference between the yield on a bank 's investments and the rate it pays for deposits and other borrowings was still <unk> higher than the N N ratio a year earlier and is among the best in the industry analysts said 
 the high margin partly stems from continued strong growth in <unk> consumer loans which jumped N N to $ N billion from a year earlier and residential mortgages which rose N N to $ N billion 
 bankamerica 's total loans rose N N to $ N billion 
 for the nine months bankamerica profit soared N N to $ N million or $ N a share from $ N million or $ N a share 
 international business machines corp. will announce on tuesday a slew of software products aimed at eliminating some of the major problems involved in <unk> manufacturing operations industry executives said 
 many plant floors currently resemble a tower of <unk> with computers robots and machine tools that generally speak their own language and have trouble talking to each other 
 as a result if a problem develops on a production line it is unlikely some supervisor sitting in front of a personal computer or workstation will know about it or be able to correct it 
 so ibm will be announcing more than N products that will be aimed at letting even the <unk> machine tool talk to the <unk> mainframe or anything in between 
 in an unusual display of openness ibm also will be helping customers tie together operations that include lots of equipment made by ibm 's competitors 
 in addition the executives said ibm will be offering programming tools designed to let anyone working on a factory floor write <unk> software for instance to do statistical analysis that would pinpoint a problem on a manufacturing line 
 in armonk n.y. an ibm spokeswoman confirmed that ibm executives will be announcing some <unk> plans next week but declined to elaborate 
 the industry executives said that as usual with such broad announcements from ibm this one will be part reality and part strategy 
 so it will take many quarters for ibm to roll out all the products that customers need and it will take years for customers to integrate the products into their operations 
 also as usual the products will appeal mostly to heavy users of ibm equipment at least initially 
 still consultants and industry executives said the products could help make manufacturing operations more efficient and provide a boost to the <unk> market a market that yankee group a research firm has said may double to $ N billion by N 
 this is a step in the right direction said martin <unk> a yankee group analyst 
 he added though that a lot of this is intentions 
 we 'll have to wait and see how the plan develops 
 the announcements also should help ibm go on the offensive against digital equipment corp. on the plant floor 
 while ibm has traditionally dominated the market for computers on the business side of manufacturing operations and has done well in the market for design tools digital has dominated computerized manufacturing 
 hewlett-packard co. also has begun to gain share in the whole <unk> arena 
 ibm will face an <unk> climb against digital given digital 's reputation for being better than ibm at <unk> together different manufacturers ' computers 
 in addition hewlett-packard while a much smaller player has made a big commitment to the sorts of industry standards that facilitate those <unk> and could give ibm some problems 
 both can be expected to go after the market aggressively gartner group inc. a research firm estimated the digital gets N N of its revenue from the manufacturing market and hewlett-packard gets N N 
 ibm which gartner group said generates N N of its revenue in this market should be able to take advantage of its loyal following among buyers of equipment 
 that is because many companies will <unk> on certain types of equipment as the various parts of the manufacturing market merge and ibm is the biggest player 
 but much will depend on how quickly ibm can move 
 the whole idea of <unk> manufacturing <unk> seems to be making a comeback after losing a little <unk> over the past couple of years when it became apparent that it was n't a <unk> that would make u.s. plants more efficient and <unk> foreign competition 
 <unk> <unk> a gartner group analyst said <unk> changes may still be required to really take advantage of <unk> 's <unk> someone on the shop floor may not like having someone in an office using a personal computer to look over his shoulder for instance and may be able to prevent that from happening 
 but he said a system such as ibm 's should help significantly 
 in making polyethylene sheets out of plastic chips for instance a chip sometimes does n't <unk> gets caught in the machinery and creates a run in the sheets 
 that can be expensive because the problem may not be noticed for a while and the sheets are typically thrown away 
 but mr. <unk> said that if computers can be integrated into the process they could alert an operator as soon as the problem occurred 
 they could also check through the orders on file to find a customer that was willing to accept a lower grade of polyethylene 
 the computer would let the machine run just until that order was filled eliminating waste 
 this sort of improved link figures to eventually become a significant weapon for some companies 
 companies might be able to tell salespeople daily for instance about idle equipment so they could offer discounts on whatever that equipment produces 
 salespeople also could get a precise reading on when products could be delivered in much the same way that federal express has marketed its ability to tell exactly where a package is in the delivery system 
 ford motor co. 's merkur the company 's first new car franchise in the u.s. since the <unk> was unveiled in N now will share <unk> 's fate 
 ford said yesterday it will halt imports of the merkur scorpio a $ N luxury sedan built by ford of europe in west germany 
 the cars are sold under a separate franchise with its own sign in front of <unk> dealers as opposed to new models such as <unk> or <unk> which are sold under existing ford divisions 
 the move to halt imports announced N years and N months to the day after henry ford ii declared that the <unk> division and its <unk> car would be scrapped <unk> the four-year-old merkur brand in the u.s. market 
 it will continue to be sold in the european market 
 merkur 's death is n't nearly as costly to ford as was the <unk> debacle because merkur was a relatively <unk> project with limited sales goals 
 still merkur 's demise is a setback for ford at a time when the company 's image as the u.s. auto maker with the golden touch is showing signs of strain 
 the no. N auto maker 's new <unk> and mercury <unk> models have n't met sales expectations in the year since they were introduced and ford 's trucks are losing ground to their gm rivals 
 this fall ford introduced only one new product a <unk> version of its <unk> lincoln town car luxury model 
 the demise of merkur <unk> <unk> comes after a september in which N merkur dealers managed to sell only N <unk> 
 total merkur sales for the first nine months dropped N N from a year ago to just N cars 
 merkur is n't the only european luxury brand having problems in the u.s. 
 the japanese assault on the luxury market is rapidly <unk> such european makes as <unk> and saab which at least have clear brand images 
 merkur as an import on domestic car lots suffered from the same sort of image confusion that is <unk> sales of imports at general motors corp. and chrysler corp 
 merkur was originally aimed at <unk> into <unk> dealerships the kind of young affluent buyers who would n't be caught dead in a town car a vehicle so <unk> that ford is staging a press event next month linking the town car 's launch to the <unk> of a new aircraft carrier in norfolk va 
 but the brand had trouble from the start 
 the first merkur the <unk> went on sale in early N 
 the <unk> <unk> <unk> in part because american buyers did n't go for the car 's unusual <unk> rear <unk> 
 in may N ford began importing the scorpio sedan from west germany to sell next to a <unk> <unk> in <unk> 
 ford officials said they expected the two <unk> would sell about N cars a year and in N they reached that goal as sales hit N cars 
 it was <unk> from there however 
 one major factor was the decline of the dollar against the mark which began less than a year after merkur 's N launch 
 as the west german currency rose so did merkur prices 
 the merkur cars also suffered from <unk> quality some dealers say 
 it was like a comedy of errors says martin j. <unk> <unk> a big dealer whose star <unk> operation in <unk> mich. sold more <unk> 's than any other dealership 
 but by the third quarter of N <unk> had a high satisfaction rating in internal ford studies a spokesman said 
 apparently however the improvement came too late 
 last fall ford announced it would <unk> the <unk> in the u.s. at the end of the N model year 
 ford said then it would keep the scorpio 
 this year scorpio sales plummeted and at the current sales pace it would take ford N days to sell off the current scorpio inventory of about N cars 
 canadian pacific ltd. said it proposed acquiring the N N of soo line corp. it does n't already own for $ N a share or about $ N million after failing to find a buyer for its majority stake earlier this year

 canadian pacific which has interests in transportation telecommunications forest products energy and real estate finally took its majority block off the market this spring 
 it turned out we could n't sell it a canadian pacific official said adding that acquiring the remainder of soo line is now the best way to <unk> operations 
 canadian pacific is soo line 's biggest customer and has owned a majority stake in the u.s. railroad since N 
 canadian pacific and soo line tracks <unk> at two points in the west on the <unk> border and the two companies operate a very successful <unk> rail service

 h.f. ahmanson parent of home savings of america reported third-quarter net of $ N million or N cents a share down from $ N million or N cents a share in the year-earlier period

 the house public works and transportation committee approved a bill that would give the transportation department power to block airline leveraged buy-outs despite a clear veto threat from the bush administration 
 the N vote clears the way for consideration on the house floor next week or the week after 
 transportation secretary samuel skinner in a letter to the committee warned that he would urge president bush to veto the legislation if it passed congress 
 the senate commerce committee already has approved similar legislation 
 on monday a letter from mr. skinner 's deputy <unk> <unk> said the administration opposed the legislation in its present form 
 some of the bill 's supporters had taken heart from the fact that the letter was n't signed by mr. skinner and that it did n't contain a veto threat

 we backed this bill because we thought it would help skinner one republican said and now we 're out there <unk> in the wind 
 a few weeks ago mr. skinner testified before congress that it would be cleaner more efficient if he had authority to block buy-outs in advance

 under the committee bill the transportation secretary would have N days and an additional N days if needed to review any proposed purchase of N N or more of a major u.s. airline 's voting stock 
 the secretary would be required to block an acquisition if he concluded that it would so weaken an airline financially that it would hurt safety or reduce the carrier 's ability to compete or if it gave control to a foreign interest 
 although the legislation would apply to any acquisition of a major airline it is aimed at transactions financed by large amounts of debt 
 supporters of the bill are concerned an airline might sacrifice costly safety measures in order to repay debt 
 the panel 's action occurs in a politically charged atmosphere surrounding recent buy-out proposals their apparent collapse and the volatile conditions in the stock market 
 it became apparent in hearings that there ought to be regulation of leveraged buy-outs of some sort rep. james <unk> d. minn. chairman of the house aviation subcommittee said during the panel 's deliberations 
 i do n't believe in the airline business you can be totally <unk> because of the high degree of public interest at stake 
 but mr. skinner disagreed calling the legislation a retreat from the policy of <unk> of the airline industry 
 in his letter to committee chairman glenn anderson d. calif. the secretary also said the bill would be at odds with the administration 's policies <unk> open foreign investment and market allocation of resources 
 currently the transportation department does n't have the authority to block a takeover in advance 
 however if the secretary concludes that a transaction has made a carrier <unk> to operate the department may revoke its certificate <unk> the airline 
 such authority is more than adequate say opponents of the legislation 
 but supporters argue that <unk> an airline is so drastic that the department would hesitate doing it 
 the panel rejected a proposal pushed by amr corp. the parent of american airlines to allow the transportation secretary to block corporate raiders from <unk> proxy fights to oust boards that oppose a leveraged buy-out 
 it also voted down proposals to give the secretary much more discretion on whether to block a buy-out and to require the department to consider the impact of a buy-out on workers

 president carlos salinas de <unk> used the army to oust la quina who <unk> for N years over a <unk> empire that made <unk> <unk> <unk> or pemex one of the world 's most inefficient oil companies 
 now mr. guzman cabrera is facing accusations that he 's as much a company man as la quina was a <unk>

 and with the quiet <unk> of mr. guzman cabrera replacing the <unk> <unk> of la quina government <unk> have been given a free hand to open the petrochemical sector to wider private and foreign investment 
 mr. guzman cabrera 's new order has n't arrived without resistance

 this is n't a new kind of union leadership it 's a new mexico 
 we 're no longer afraid of <unk> with private or foreign capital he says 
 pemex which produces N N of government revenue desperately needs new investment 
 since world oil prices collapsed in N the government has <unk> pemex 's <unk> to make payments on mexico 's $ N billion foreign debt 
 little money has been returned to upgrade pemex 's aging facilities 
 while the government <unk> pemex from above the union has <unk> it from below 
 a bloated payroll and pervasive <unk> caused pemex 's operating costs to balloon to N cents of each $ N in sales far above the industry <unk> 
 the declines in investment and efficiency explain in part why mexico has been importing gasoline this year 
 some projections show mexico importing crude by the end of the century barring an overhaul of operations 
 whatever you tried to change whether it was cutting costs or attracting new partners the big obstacle was the old union leadership says oil consultant george baker

 i 'm the <unk> if there is one he says <unk> a <unk> to his office

 though he also long benefited from the system built by la quina mr. guzman cabrera says union <unk> had simply gotten out of hand 
 they are at the base of all of the problems of corruption he says 
 thus in recent contract negotiations mr. guzman cabrera gave up the union 's right to <unk> N N of all of pemex 's outside contracts an enormous source of <unk>

 the union will keep a N N commission on construction projects

 but pemex managers are the ones most <unk> by the contract 
 we are <unk> the instruments of administration says <unk> <unk> a pemex <unk> 
 pemex officials would n't say how much money the new contract would save the company but one previous government estimate pegged savings at around $ N million a year

 later the government <unk> several basic petrochemicals as secondary products 
 but pemex 's <unk> with private companies and especially foreign ones is controversial in a country where oil has been a symbol of national sovereignty since foreign oil holdings were <unk> in N 
 they are preparing the workers for what 's coming foreign control wrote <unk> <unk> a leftist leader 
 mr. guzman cabrera and government officials insist that foreigners will be limited to investing in secondary petroleum products

 british airways plc said it is seeking improved terms and a sharply lower price in any revised bid for united airlines parent ual corp. following the collapse of a $ N billion $ 300-a-share buy-out bid 
 <unk> stevens british air 's chief financial officer told dow jones professional investor report a price of $ N a share is certainly not too low and indicated his company would like to reduce the size of its $ N million cash investment 
 he added the airline is n't committed to going forward with any new bid and has n't participated in bankers ' efforts to revive the transaction that collapsed 
 we 're in no way committed to a deal going through at all 
 we 're not rushing into anything 
 we do n't want to be party to a second rejection he said adding that coming up with a revised offer could easily take several weeks 
 mr. stevens 's remarks confirming a report in the wall street journal that british air wants to start from <unk> in any new bid for the nation 's second-largest airline helped push ual stock lower for the fourth straight day 
 ual fell $ N a share to $ N on volume of N million shares in composite trading on the new york stock exchange as concern <unk> among takeover stock traders about the length of time it will take to revive the purchase 
 under the original buy-out approved by the ual board sept. N ual 's pilots planned to put up $ N million in cash and make $ N million in annual cost concessions for a N N stake 
 ual management was to pay $ N million for N N and british air was to receive a N N stake 
 the buy-out fell through when citicorp and chase manhattan corp. unexpectedly failed to obtain bank financing 
 since then ual stock has fallen N N in what may rank as the largest collapse of a takeover stock ever 
 the <unk> of mr. stevens 's remarks seemed to indicate that british air will take a more active <unk> role in pursuing any new bid 
 he said he believes ual management was badly advised on the funding of its original transaction 
 mr. stevens said british air has n't received any new buy-out proposals from the labor-management group led by ual chairman stephen wolf and has n't received any indication of when one might be <unk> 
 as far as we 're concerned we 're waiting for the dust to settle he said 
 although british air is waiting to see what the buy-out group comes up with mr. stevens said a revised transaction with less debt leverage is likely to be more attractive to banks 
 he said the original proposal is dead and all aspects of a revised version are up for change in light of the changes in ual 's market price the amount of debt banks are willing to fund and the price british air would be willing to pay 
 mr. stevens said he expects the new price will be considerably lower but declined to specify a figure 
 asked whether a $ <unk> figure circulating in the market yesterday is too low he said it 's certainly not too low 
 he added the original offer was a pretty full price and that british air 's contribution was quite a large chunk for us 
 british air was originally attracted to the chance of obtaining a N N stake in the company but was n't particularly happy with paying $ N million 
 if the new deal had us putting up less money but still having N N that would be a point in our favor he said 
 in any new proposal british air would expect a greater rate of return than the <unk> in the original proposal 
 in the event that the buy-out group <unk> in <unk> its bid the ual board could remain under some pressure to seek another transaction even without any legal obligation to do so 
 roughly one-third of its stock is believed held by takeover stock traders who could vote to oust the board if they become <unk> 
 meanwhile the buy-out group 's task of holding its fragile coalition together in the face of the bid 's collapse and internal opposition from two other employee groups has been further complicated by an apparent <unk> in the ranks of the pilot union itself 
 a pilot representing a group of N pilots hired during united 's N strike filed suit friday in chicago federal court to block the takeover 
 the dissident pilots oppose the plan because it would cause them to lose their seniority 
 ual 's management agreed to reduce the seniority of those pilots in exchange for the support of the united pilot union for the buy-out proposal 
 the N pilots involved in the suit are n't members of the union 
 the airline had allowed them to move ahead of some union members in seniority following the N strike a move the union had contested in a previous lawsuit

 although it probably has reduced the level of expenditures for some purchasers utilization management like most other cost <unk> strategies does n't appear to have altered the long-term rate of increase in health-care costs the institute of medicine an affiliate of the national academy of sciences concluded after a two-year study 
 employers who saw a short-term <unk> in benefit expenditures are seeing a return to previous trends 
 while utilization management frequently reduces <unk> costs these savings are often offset by increases in <unk> services and higher administrative costs according to the report by a panel of health-care experts 
 the report suggested that current review programs are too narrow 
 the unnecessary and inappropriate use of the hospital and not the actual need for a particular procedure has been the main focus the panel said 
 as a general rule <unk> programs have not made <unk> <unk> of the <unk> costs of alternative <unk> or sites of care 
 the report said that utilization management should have more of an impact as federal research on the effectiveness of medical <unk> helps lead to medical practice guidelines 
 howard <unk> a panel member and a vice president of aetna life & casualty said that utilization management will also do a better job of containing costs as it spreads to cover medical services delivered outside of hospitals 
 there 's pretty good evidence that utilization management has reduced inappropriate <unk> he said 
 but at the same time spending on physician services and <unk> care have <unk> 
 it 's like <unk> a balloon dr. <unk> said 
 david <unk> of a. foster <unk> & co. said that clients of his consulting firm report that utilization management reduces their hospital care bills by about N N but he agreed that for the health-care system as whole some of these savings are offset by administrative and <unk> care costs 
 jerome <unk> chairman of the panel agrees that administrative costs of utilization management programs can be high 
 you have a whole staff standing ready to evaluate the <unk> of recommended treatment he said 
 dr. <unk> who also is president of new england medical center hospitals in boston noted that the hospitals he runs deal with more than N utilization management firms and that many of them have different procedures and requirements 
 the panel urged greater efforts to reduce the <unk> <unk> and cost of utilization review 
 utilization management needs to better demonstrate that it reduces the <unk> use of resources improves the <unk> of patient care and imposes only reasonable burdens on patients and <unk> the panel concluded 
 renault and daf trucks <unk> announced a preliminary agreement to jointly manufacture a line of trucks in britain and france 
 <unk> <unk> a renault managing director said the new line will cover trucks of between N tons and N tons and will be built at renault 's <unk> plant in france and at daf 's british plant 
 the french state-controlled auto group and the dutch truck maker plan to <unk> the new trucks into their product lines when they begin production toward the middle of the 1990s 
 mr. <unk> said he expects a definitive agreement between the two companies to be completed in the next few months 
 the venture is the latest example of the trend toward cooperative projects in europe ahead of the N deadline for eliminating trade barriers within the european community 
 renault and daf are expected to invest a total of about three billion french francs $ N million in the venture including <unk> N billion for design and development costs 
 in addition the companies will each spend about <unk> N billion on <unk> up their plants 
 mr. <unk> said the joint venture represents considerable savings for both renault and daf since both companies would in any case have had to renew their existing ranges of light goods vehicles 
 by <unk> their resources the two groups have effectively <unk> the design and development costs that would otherwise have been <unk> he said 
 renault officials said the potential european market for light trucks in the <unk> to <unk> range is between N and N vehicles annually and renault and daf are aiming for a combined market share of about N N 
 both renault and daf will have world-wide marketing rights for the new range of vans and light trucks 
 under a separate arrangement british aerospace plc 's <unk> group plc subsidiary will also be able to offer the vehicles through its dealers in the u.k. and renault 's <unk> subsidiary renault vehicles <unk> will have similar rights in france 
 daf is <unk> by british aerospace with a further N N held by the dutch state-owned chemical group <unk> <unk> 
 the van <unk> family of the netherlands holds an additional N N of daf 's capital 
 the federal reserve system is the standard object of suggestions for <unk> and institutional changes for two reasons 
 first its position in the government is <unk> 
 it has an unusual kind of independence from elected officials and still has authority over one of the most powerful of government 's instruments the control of the money supply 
 thus we have a condition that is easily described as <unk> 
 second the responsibilities of the federal reserve as guardian of the currency which means as guardian of the stability of the price level sometimes lead it to take measures that are unpopular 
 as former fed chairman william <unk> martin used to say they would have to take the <unk> bowl away just as the party is getting interesting 
 so the federal reserve is an attractive target for complaint by politicians 
 the fed is easily assigned the blame for <unk> like high interest rates or slow economic growth while the politicians can escape responsibility by pointing to the fed 's independence 
 this leads to proposals for reform of the fed which have the common feature of making the fed more responsive to the administration to the congress and to public opinion without however any assumption of additional responsibility by the politicians 
 these proposals include changing the term of the chairman <unk> the terms of the members eliminating the presidents of the federal reserve banks from the <unk> process putting the secretary of the treasury on the federal reserve board having the fed <unk> by an arm of congress the general accounting office putting the fed 's expenditures in the budget and requiring prompt publication of the fed 's minutes 
 some of these ideas are again under consideration in congress 
 but these proposals do not rest on a view of what the fed 's problem is or if they do they rest on an incorrect view 
 they would not solve the problem they would make it worse 
 the problem is not that the fed is too <unk> to the public interest 
 on the contrary it is too responsive to an incorrect view of the public interest 
 the price level in the u.s. is now about N N times as high as it was N years ago 
 on average something that cost $ N N years ago now costs $ N 
 or a wage that was $ N N years ago would buy only $ N worth of stuff today 
 on two occasions the inflation rate rose to more than N N a year 
 in each case the ending of this <unk> inflation caused a severe recession the two worst of the postwar period 
 the enormous inflation over the past N years was largely due to monetary policy 
 at least it would not have happened without the support of monetary policy that provided for a <unk> increase in the money supply during the same period 
 and that increase in the money supply would not have happened without the consent of the federal reserve 
 the basic problem of monetary policy to which reform of the fed should be addressed is to prevent a <unk> of this experience 
 there were two general reasons for the <unk> monetary policy of the past N years 
 N to some extent the federal reserve shared the popular but incorrect view that <unk> monetary policy could yield a net improvement in employment and output 
 N even where the fed did not share this view it felt the need to accommodate to it 
 despite all the formal provisions for its independence the fed seems constantly to feel that if it uses its independence too freely it will lose it 
 the common proposals for <unk> the fed would only make the situation worse if they had any effect at all 
 putting the secretary of the treasury on the board of governors one of the leading proposals today is an example 
 the secretary is the world 's biggest <unk> of money 
 he has a <unk> constant <unk> for lower interest rates 
 moreover he is a political agent of a political president who naturally gives extraordinary weight to the way the economy will perform before the next election and less to its <unk> health 
 these days the secretary <unk> the further <unk> that he is a member of a club of seven finance ministers who meet occasionally to decide what exchange rates should be which is a diversion from the real business of the federal reserve to stabilize the price level 
 how should a reasonable member of the federal reserve board interpret a congressional decision to put the secretary on the board 
 could he <unk> interpret it as encouragement for the fed to give primary emphasis to stabilizing the price level 
 or would he interpret it as instruction to give more weight to these other objectives that the secretary represents low interest rates <unk> economic expansion and <unk> of exchange rates at internationally managed levels 
 the answer seems perfectly clear 
 true a succession of fed chairmen has given color to the notion that the secretary of the treasury belongs on the fed 
 by their constant <unk> to advise all and <unk> about federal budgetary matters the chairmen have encouraged the belief that fiscal policy and monetary policy are <unk> of a common <unk> in which case it is natural that the fed and the treasury and probably also the congress should be jointly engaged in <unk> the pot 
 the fed 's case for its own independence would be a little stronger if it were more <unk> of the independence of the rest of the government 
 the fed 's problem is not that it is too independent or too <unk> 
 the fed is responsive to and can not help being responsive to the more <unk> political part of the government 
 the fed exercises a power given to it by congress and the president 
 but congress and the president accept no responsibility for the exercise of the power they have given the fed 
 critics of the present arrangement are correct to say that it is <unk> 
 what is <unk> is the <unk> of the more political parts of the government to take the responsibility for deciding the basic question of monetary policy which is what priority should be given to stabilizing the price level 
 to leave this decision to an independent agency is not only <unk> 
 it also prevents the conduct of a policy that has a long-term rationale because it leaves the fed <unk> about what are the expectations of its masters the politicians who have never had to consider the long-term consequences of monetary policy 
 the greatest contribution congress could make at this time would be to declare that stabilizing the price level is the primary responsibility of the federal reserve system 
 legislation to this effect has been introduced in congress in this session by rep. stephen neal d. n.c 
 it is not the kind of thing that is likely to be enacted however 
 congress would be required to make a hard decision and congress would much prefer to leave the hard decision to the fed and retain its rights of complaint after the fact 
 people will say that the nation and the government have other objectives in addition to stabilizing the price level which is true 
 but that is not the same as saying that the federal reserve has other objectives 
 the government has other agencies and instruments for pursuing these other objectives 
 but it has only the fed to pursue <unk> stability 
 and the fed has at most very limited ability to contribute to the achievement of other objectives by means other than by stabilizing the price level 
 the two objectives most commonly thought to be legitimate competitors for the attention of the fed are high employment and rapid real growth 
 but the main lesson of economic policy in the past N years is that if the fed <unk> with the <unk> objective in the pursuit of these other goals the result is not high employment and rapid growth but is inflation

 republic new york corp. joined the list of banks boosting reserves for losses on loans to less-developed countries setting out a $ N million provision and posting a $ N million third-quarter net loss as a result 
 the per-share loss was $ N 
 in the year earlier period the new york parent of republic national bank had net income of $ N million or $ N a share 
 excluding the provision republic earned $ N million up N N from a year ago 
 the bank 's <unk> and long-term loans to less-developed countries total $ N million of which $ N million are n't <unk> interest the bank said 
 republic 's total of nonperforming assets was $ N million at sept. N with its reserve for loan losses now standing at $ N million 
 abortion-rights advocates won last week 's <unk> but the war over the nation 's <unk> social question is about to pick up again on turf that favors those seeking to restrict abortions 
 strict new regulations seem certain to pass the state house in pennsylvania next week with easy approval by the senate and by democratic gov. bob <unk> expected shortly thereafter 
 legislation to require the consent of parents before their daughters under the age of N can have abortions will probably pass both houses of the michigan legislature and set up a <unk> battle to override the expected veto of democratic gov. james <unk> 
 the short-term shift in the political climate surrounding abortion reflects two factors that are likely to govern the debate in the next several months the <unk> of the abortion-rights movement as a potent force after years of <unk> and the ability of each side to counter the other 's advance in one arena with a victory of its own elsewhere 
 the action in pennsylvania for example will follow last week 's collapse of a special session of the florida legislature to enact restrictions on abortions in that state and the vote here in washington by the house to permit federally paid abortions for poor women who are victims of rape or incest 
 but president bush is expected to veto the congressional legislation and that along with the easy approval of the pennsylvania measure is likely to <unk> the abortion-rights activists ' claims of momentum and <unk> the challenges faced by this <unk> movement 
 it 's great to feel good for once in N years says harrison <unk> a consultant to abortion-rights advocates reflecting the relief of his <unk> after last week 's victories the first major events since the supreme court in its july N webster decision permitted the states to enact restrictions on abortions 
 but how many more times we 're going to feel good in the next N is another question 
 indeed abortion-rights activists still face their greatest tests 
 the pro-choice movement has shown finally that it can <unk> says <unk> <unk> a <unk> university political scientist who specializes in how state legislators handle the abortion question 
 but it still has n't shown that it can win in a state like pennsylvania or missouri where abortion has been clearly an electoral issue and where it 's been an emotional issue for a long time 
 the foes of abortion hold the strong whip hand in pennsylvania where abortion-rights activists are so much on the defensive that their strategy is less to fight the proposed legislation than it is to stress how the state legislature does n't reflect the <unk> of the state 's citizens 
 as a result gop state rep. stephen <unk> of delaware county the legislature 's leading <unk> of abortion has been given all but free rein to press a strict <unk> plan to restrict abortion and he hopes to force the supreme court directly to <unk> its N roe v. wade decision that established the right of abortion in the first place 
 the <unk> legislation the state 's house judiciary committee approved it in <unk> this week and the full pennsylvania house is expected to take up the bill next tuesday includes a provision to ban abortions after N weeks of pregnancy except to <unk> the death of the mother 
 mr. <unk> <unk> that the provision which attacks the <unk> standards that roe established will make it necessary for the supreme court to review roe and perhaps to <unk> it 
 but the pennsylvania measure also includes an informed consent provision that may become widely <unk> by abortion foes who want to make women contemplating abortion as uncomfortable as possible with the procedure and with themselves 
 under this legislation a woman must be informed N hours before the operation of the details of the procedure and its risks 
 regardless of whether one supports or opposes the right to an abortion mr. <unk> argues it is virtually impossible for any rational human being to disagree with the concept that a woman has the right to have all of the appropriate materials and advice made available to her before she makes a decision which one way or the other might remain with her for the rest of her life 
 in michigan where the state senate is expected to approve <unk> legislation by the end of next week gov. <unk> is the principal obstacle for anti-abortionists 
 susan <unk> a consultant to abortion-rights activists in the state takes comfort from the fact that the state 's house abortion opponents have n't been able to <unk> the votes to <unk> a veto on abortion in N years 
 but proponents believe they may be able to shake enough votes loose to override the veto if they are successful in portraying the legislation as a matter of parents ' rights 
 in illinois lawmakers will vote before next spring on legislation requiring physicians to perform tests on <unk> at N weeks to determine their <unk> age weight and lung maturity along with a provision requiring that if <unk> survive an abortion a second doctor must be on hand to help it survive 
 the legislation failed by one vote to clear the house rules committee tuesday but anti-abortionists still may succeed in bringing the measure to the floor this fall 
 <unk> <unk> executive director of the illinois planned <unk> council says she and her allies are cautiously optimistic they can defeat it if it comes to a floor vote 
 abortion foes in wisconsin meanwhile expect a <unk> bill to be sent to the state assembly floor by early november and are hopeful of prevailing in both houses by next march 
 in texas abortion opponents want to pass <unk> legislation along with a statewide ban on the use of public funds personnel and facilities for abortion and viability tests for <unk> N weeks and older 
 the anti-abortionists are urging gop gov. bill <unk> to press the issues in a special session scheduled to run nov. N to dec. N 
 the <unk> is only fair says <unk> roberts administrative director of the texas right to life committee 
 next year is an election year and the legislators just do n't want to do anything about this now 
 this legislative activity comes as both sides are undertaking new <unk> efforts plunging into gubernatorial races in virginia and new jersey and <unk> for next autumn 's state elections 
 at the same time abortion foes have developed a national legislative strategy deciding to move on what <unk> <unk> the national right to life committee 's director of state <unk> development calls reasonable measures that an overwhelming mainstream majority of americans support 
 these include bans on the use of abortion for birth control and sex selection and the public funding of alternatives for abortion 
 those who are on the other side can hardly oppose alternative funding if they continue to insist on calling themselves pro-choice rather than <unk> says mary <unk> the group 's associate state legislative coordinator 
 over the weekend the national abortion rights action league singled out eight politicians including pennsylvania 's mr. <unk> as N targets and held a washington <unk> designed to train its leaders in political techniques including how to put the anti-abortionists on the defensive in state legislatures

 an estimated $ N million was added for university and science grants including $ N million for smith college

 the large increase in customs service <unk> funds is also intended to counter <unk> and the annual appropriations level has more than <unk> in five years 
 the $ N million provided for fiscal N anticipates the purchase of a lockheed <unk> <unk> aircraft and five <unk> <unk> ii jets 
 despite administration reservations the plan has had the quiet backing of customs officials as well as influential lawmakers from <unk> 's home state kansas 
 among legislative provisions attached to the bill is a ban on any treasury department expenditure for enforcement of a N tax provision intended to counter discrimination in <unk> plans 
 small-business interests have lobbied against the so-called section N tax rules

 b.a.t industries plc may delay aspects of its defensive restructuring plan including the sale of its saks fifth avenue and marshall field units in the wake of the current upheaval in financial markets company officials said 
 the british conglomerate planning its own defensive restructuring to fight off a # N billion $ N billion takeover bid by <unk> financier sir james goldsmith intends to press ahead with an extraordinary shareholder vote today to clear the way for its <unk> measures 
 if anything the gyrations in world stock markets and in b.a.t 's share price since last friday 's sharp wall street sell-off have increased the likelihood of shareholder approval for the restructuring analysts and several big institutional holders said 
 <unk> god we have some deal on the table said stewart <unk> a director at scottish amicable investment managers which intends to vote its roughly N N stake in favor of the restructuring 
 investors in b.a.t have been on a roller <unk> 
 b.a.t has been london 's <unk> blue chip over the past six months up N N against a N N rise in the financial times 100-share index 
 but this week b.a.t has been hit harder than other big u.k. stocks first by the market gyrations then by tuesday 's san francisco earthquake which could leave b.a.t 's farmers group inc. insurance unit facing big claims 
 b.a.t rose five pence eight cents to N pence $ N in london yesterday as a late market rally erased a <unk> fall earlier in the day 
 to fight off <unk> b.a.t plans to spin off about $ N billion in assets largely by selling such u.s. retailing units as marshall field and saks and by floating its big paper and u.k. retailing business via share issues to existing holders 
 proceeds will help pay for a planned buy-back of N N of its shares and a N N dividend increase 
 i think the restructuring will get the required support said michael <unk> an analyst at london <unk> <unk> phillips & drew 
 the shareholders effectively will support the share price by clearing the share buy-back 
 but b.a.t 's restructuring which was never going to happen quickly now will take longer because of the market upheaval 
 company officials holders and analysts who previously expected the <unk> to be substantially complete by the end of next year 's first half now say the market gyrations could delay the actions well into the second half 
 we are n't forced sellers 
 we do n't have an <unk> deadline and if market conditions are truly awful we might decide it is not the right time to take particular steps said michael <unk> a b.a.t spokesman 
 even if b.a.t receives approval for the restructuring the company will remain in play say shareholders and analysts though the situation may <unk> over the next N months rather than six 
 the new b.a.t will be a smaller tobacco and financial-services hybrid whose price-earnings ratio may more closely reflect the <unk> tobacco business than the <unk> financial-services business these holders believe 
 thus b.a.t 's restructuring may only make the company a more <unk> target for other corporate <unk> possibly such <unk> bidders as hanson plc 
 the last few days will surely slow down the pace of events says scottish amicable 's mr. <unk> 
 but i would n't write off sir james or other potential bidders 
 among possible delays the sales of saks and marshall field which were expected to be on the block soon after the crucial christmas season may slide into the second quarter or second half 
 analysts estimate that sales of the two businesses could raise roughly $ N billion 
 b.a.t is n't predicting a <unk> because the units are quality businesses and we are encouraged by the <unk> of inquiries said mr. <unk> 
 but the delay could happen if b.a.t does n't get adequate bids he said 
 people familiar with b.a.t say possible <unk> for the units include managers from both retailing chains and general <unk> corp. which is interested in bidding for saks 
 other potential bidders for parts of b.a.t 's u.s. retail unit include <unk> department stores inc. may department stores co. and limited inc 
 b.a.t has declined to identify the potential bidders 
 though sir james has said he intends to mount a new bid for b.a.t once approval from u.s. insurance regulators is received jitters over prospects for junk-bond financing and u.s. leverage buy-outs are making investors more skeptical about sir james 's prospects 
 his initial offer indicated he needed to raise as much as N N of the takeover financing through the debt markets 
 market uncertainty also clouds the outlook for b.a.t 's attracting a premium price for its u.s. retailing properties 
 finally tuesday 's california earthquake initially knocked N N off b.a.t 's share price in london yesterday because of fears of the potential claims to los angeles-based farmers which has a substantial portion of its property and casualty exposure in california 
 on farmers mr. <unk> said it is too early to <unk> the level of potential claims 
 he added b.a.t has no expectation of a material impact on farmers

 tom <unk> executive vice president and general manager of the california trucking association in <unk> said his organization urged trucking firms to halt all deliveries into the bay area yesterday except for <unk> supplies 
 some <unk> shipments will probably resume thursday he said 
 right now most of the roads into the bay area are closed but the list of closings changes about every N minutes 
 this wednesday morning the san mateo bridge was open and now we are informed that it is closed mr. <unk> said 
 united parcel service greenwich conn. said its operations in the san francisco area have been reduced to N N of normal

 the spokesman noted <unk> to <unk> traffic delays on the san mateo bridge for example 
 in addition power failures prevented its <unk> facilities from operating causing delays

 we had no serious damage on the railroad said a southern pacific spokesman 
 we have no problem to our freight service at all expect for the fact businesses are shut down 
 <unk> said it suspended train service into its oakland station which sustained heavy structural damage during the quake 
 the passenger railroad said it terminated some runs in sacramento relying on buses to ferry passengers to the bay area 
 <unk> said it planned to resume some train operations to oakland late yesterday 
 <unk> operations suffered little damage according to albert engelken deputy executive director of the american public transit association in washington

 the highway system is <unk> up by the earthquake mr. engelken said 
 the transit system is how people are going to be getting around 
 he added that san francisco 's <unk> cars and <unk> buses were also running at full service levels 
 although <unk> delays in san francisco were significant yesterday they did n't appear to spread to other airports 
 the earthquake shattered windows at san francisco international 's <unk> control tower and <unk> pieces of the ceiling down on controllers three of whom suffered minor injuries 
 terminals at san francisco international also were damaged but the tower itself was intact 
 tuesday night thousands were diverted to other airports and had to wait a day to resume travel 
 <unk> at san francisco were n't damaged but traffic was being limited yesterday to N <unk> and N departures an hour down from N to N an hour normally mainly because the noise level in the control tower was overwhelming without the windows an faa spokeswoman said

 united airlines the largest carrier at san francisco was operating only N N of its scheduled service in and out of the area because of damage to its terminal which in turn was causing delays for travelers headed to the bay area

 whitbread & co. put its spirits division up for sale triggering a scramble among global groups for the british company 's brands 
 whitbread already has been approached by about half a dozen companies interested in buying all or part of the spirits business a spokesman said 
 analysts expect the spirits operations and some california <unk> that also are being sold to fetch about # N million $ N million 
 among the brands for sale are beefeater gin the no. N imported gin in the u.s. and <unk> <unk> whiskey 
 also for sale are <unk> <unk> co. which distributes <unk> <unk> <unk> whiskey in the u.s. and whitbread 's atlas peak <unk> in california 's <unk> valley 
 beefeater alone is worth as much as # N million analysts said 
 whitbread bought the beefeater <unk> two years ago for # N million 
 that purchase represented an attempt by whitbread a venerable british brewer to become a major player in the global liquor business 
 but whitbread has been squeezed by giant rivals amid widespread consolidation in the industry 
 now it wants to concentrate on beer and its newer hotel and restaurant operations 
 for rival liquor companies the whitbread auction is a rare opportunity to acquire valuable brands 
 it 's not very often something like this comes up said ron <unk> a liquor company analyst at nomura research institute in london 
 the division will be sold off quite rapidly predicted <unk> <unk> an analyst at london brokers county natwest <unk>

 digital equipment corp. is planning a big <unk> party on tuesday for its first line of mainframe computers 
 but an <unk> guest is expected to try to crash the party 
 on the morning of the <unk> announcement international business machines corp. is to introduce its own new mainframe 
 their attitude is you want to talk mainframes we 'll talk mainframes says one computer industry executive 
 they 're deliberately trying to steal our <unk> a digital executive complains 
 maybe we should take it as a <unk> 
 digital 's target is the $ N billion market for mainframe computers the <unk> <unk> that nearly every big company needs to run its business 
 ibm based in armonk n.y. has dominated the market for decades 
 that does n't scare digital which has grown to be the world 's second-largest computer maker by <unk> customers of ibm 's <unk> machines 
 digital based in maynard mass. hopes to stage a repeat performance in mainframes and it has spent almost $ N billion developing the new technology 
 a <unk> <unk> tandem computers inc. in cupertino calif. jumped into the fray earlier this week with an aggressively priced entry 
 ibm appears more worried about digital which has a broad base of customers waiting for the new line dubbed the vax N 
 it 's going to be nuclear war says thomas <unk> a consultant with <unk> group inc 
 the surge in competition is expected to stir new life into the huge mainframe market where growth has slowed to single <unk> in recent years 
 ibm 's traditional mainframe rivals including unisys corp. control data corp. and ncr corp. have struggled recently 
 digital is promising a new approach 
 robert m. <unk> digital 's vice president for high performance systems says digital 's mainframe is designed not as a central computer around which everything <unk> but as part of a <unk> network <unk> together hundreds of workstations personal computers printers and other devices 
 and unlike ibm 's <unk> mainframes it does n't need any plumbing 
 the <unk> will have a big price advantage 
 digital is expected to tag its new line from about $ N million to $ N million and up depending on <unk> 
 that 's about half the price of <unk> equipped ibm mainframes 
 tandem 's pricing is just as aggressive 
 the heightened competition will hit ibm at a difficult time 
 the computer giant 's current mainframe line which has sold well and has huge profit margins is starting to show its age 
 the new <unk> due next week will boost performance by only about N N to N N 
 and ibm is n't expected to deliver a new generation of mainframes until N 
 still no one expects ibm 's rivals to deliver a <unk> 
 ibm has a <unk> on mainframes with an estimated N N share of the market 
 ibm is five times the size of digital and N times the size of tandem and <unk> enormous market power 
 it counts among its customers a majority of the world 's largest corporations which <unk> their most critical business information to ibm computers 
 we 're not going to walk in and replace a company 's corporate accounting system if it 's already running on an ibm mainframe concedes kenneth h. <unk> digital 's president 
 he says digital will target <unk> market segments such as <unk> transaction processing which includes <unk> tracking airline reservations and <unk> networks 
 tandem which already specializes in <unk> transaction processing is a potent competitor in that market 
 a key marketing target for digital will be the large number of big customers who already own both digital and ibm systems 
 one such company is bankers trust co 
 stanley rose a vice president technological and strategic planning at bankers trust says that despite digital 's low prices we are n't about to <unk> our ibm mainframes for a dec machine 
 the software conversion costs would <unk> any savings 
 but mr. rose is still looking seriously at the N 
 bankers trust uses digital 's vax to run its huge <unk> and capital markets accounts <unk> hundreds of billions of dollars each day he says 
 as that system grows larger computers may be needed 
 in the past customers had to go to ibm when they <unk> the vax 
 now they do n't have to he says 
 that 's going to cost ibm revenue 
 analysts say digital can expect this <unk> demand for the new vax to fuel strong sales next year 
 barry f. <unk> an analyst at sanford c. bernstein & co. estimates the N could boost sales by more than $ N billion in the fiscal year beginning in july 
 he bases the estimate on a survey of hundreds of digital 's largest customers 
 although digital will announce a full family of mainframes next week it is n't expected to begin shipping in volume until next year 
 the first model available will be the N which is likely to appeal to many technical and scientific buyers interested in the <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> says terry shannon of international data corp. a market research concern 
 four more models aimed <unk> at ibm 's commercial customers are expected to begin shipping in late june 
 most analysts do n't expect the new mainframes to begin contributing significantly to revenue before the fiscal first quarter which begins next july N 
 digital 's new line has been a long time coming 
 the company has long struggled to deliver a strong <unk> product and made a costly decision in N to halt development of an interim product meant to stem the revenue losses at the high end 
 digital 's failure to deliver a true <unk> machine before now may have cost the company as much as $ N billion in revenue in fiscal N mr. <unk> says 
 ibm will face still more competition in coming months

 bond prices rallied early yesterday morning as traders scrambled to buy treasury issues on fears that the northern california earthquake might lead to a stock-market debacle 
 but when stocks held steady treasury bonds later retreated 
 speculation that the federal reserve will lower interest rates in coming weeks helped push the dollar down while boosting stocks traders said 
 but many investors remain wary about stocks partly because they expect continued turbulence in the junk-bond market that would make it more difficult to finance corporate takeovers 
 i 'm surprised we did n't see more volatility in stocks said raymond f. devoe jr. market strategist at legg mason wood walker 
 i think the problems in the junk-bond area are just beginning and this will be very <unk> for companies that have issued junk bonds 
 in a bull market credit does not matter mr. devoe added 
 but when it does matter then it 's the only thing that matters 
 however many institutional investors are reacting to the stock market 's plunge as a great buying opportunity said charles i. <unk> chief investment strategist at merrill lynch capital markets 
 things are beginning to settle down

 amr corp. posted an N N drop in third-quarter net income and said the fourth quarter will be disappointing as well primarily because of <unk> profit margins and increased fuel costs 
 amr 's earnings decline comes a year after the parent company of american airlines and the rest of the airline industry set profit records 
 some analysts say the latest results only seem pale by comparison with a spectacular second half of N 
 still amr 's <unk> does n't <unk> well for the rest of the industry 
 the fort worth texas company is generally regarded as one of the <unk> in the business and its difficulties are likely to be reflected industrywide as other major carriers report third-quarter results over the next several days 
 meanwhile the company 's board which had said nothing publicly about investor donald trump 's recently withdrawn $ N billion offer for amr issued a statement <unk> <unk> and reckless bids and saying it was pleased that mr. trump had backed out 
 in the third quarter amr said net fell to $ N million or $ N a share from $ N million or $ N a share 
 revenue rose N N to $ N billion from $ N billion a year earlier 
 amr 's chairman robert l. crandall said the results were due to an N N year-to-year increase in fuel prices and a slight decrease in yield an industry measure <unk> to profit margin on each seat sold 
 we think these trends will continue and will produce a very disappointing fourth quarter as well he said 
 tim <unk> an analyst with merrill lynch & co. said the business turned faster than expected 
 costs are giving them a little bit of trouble and the whole industry is having a pricing problem 
 for the nine months amr 's net rose N N to $ N million or $ N a share from $ N million or $ N a share 
 revenue jumped N N to $ N billion from $ N billion 
 amr 's board in a statement after a regular meeting yesterday said <unk> and reckless acquisition proposals <unk> affect employee financial and business relationships and are contrary to the best interests of amr shareholders 
 amr has not been and is not for sale 
 mr. crandall said the company 's current decline in earnings is exactly the kind of situation that an <unk> leveraged company <unk> with debt from a takeover would find difficult to weather

 the government said N N of americans or N million people were living in poverty in N 
 while last year 's figure was down from N N in N and marked the fifth consecutive annual decline in the poverty rate the census bureau said the N drop was n't <unk> significant 
 the bureau 's report also showed that while some measures of the nation 's economic <unk> improved modestly in N the <unk> of prosperity were shared less <unk> than the year before 
 <unk> data derived from a march N survey of N households william <unk> associate director of the census bureau said that most groups either stayed the same or improved 
 but he added since the late 1960s the distribution of income has been slowly getting less equal 
 there was no reversal of that trend between N and N 
 per capita income a widely used measure of a nation 's economic health hit a record in N rising N N after inflation adjustment to $ N 
 but the median income of american families fell N N the first time it has failed to rise since N 
 mr. <unk> said the divergence in the two measures reflects changes in family size and structure including the rising number of <unk> families and a sharp increase in income reported by americans who are n't living in families 
 as a result of last year 's decline the government 's estimate for the number of people living below the poverty line declined by about N 
 the poverty <unk> defined as three times food expenses as calculated by the agricultural department last year was $ N for a family of four 
 the census bureau counts all cash income in determining whether families are below the line but it does n't consider other government benefits such as medicare 
 thanks largely to the continued growth of the u.s. economy the poverty rate is now substantially lower than the N peak of N N but the improvements have been modest in the past couple of years 
 poverty remains far more widespread among blacks than other americans 
 in N N N of blacks lived in poverty compared with N N for whites and N N for hispanics 
 but two-thirds of all poor americans were white 
 more than half of poor families were headed by women living without men the bureau said 
 more than <unk> of poor black families were headed by women 
 the poverty rate of children under N years old dropped last year to N N from N N in N but remained far higher than a decade ago 
 the rate among the elderly N N in N was n't significantly lower than the year before 
 if it were n't for social security payments more than three times as many elderly would be below the poverty line mr. <unk> said 
 the census bureau also said 
 some N N of all money income received by families in N went to the <unk> N N of all families up from N N in N 
 that is the greatest share reported for any year since N although changing <unk> over the years <unk> the comparison 
 the top fifth of all families got N N of the income up from N N a decade earlier 
 the bottom fifth of all families got N N of the income down from N N a decade earlier 
 confirming other government data showing that wages are n't keeping pace with inflation earnings of <unk> full-time male workers fell N N in N after adjusting for higher prices the first such drop since N 
 earnings of female workers were unchanged 
 women working full-time earned N cents for every dollar earned by men a penny more than in N and seven cents more than in N 
 median household income which includes both those living in families and those who are n't rose N N last year to $ N after inflation 
 it rose sharply in the northeast and midwest and fell slightly in the south and west 
 median family income was $ N down N N 
 per capita income of blacks though still only N N that of whites rose N N in N while per capita income of whites rose only N N 
 among married couples the gap between blacks and whites narrowed sharply as income of black families shot up N N while income of whites did n't <unk> 
 fueling a controversy that has been <unk> for years the census bureau also said its figures would look far <unk> if it <unk> the poverty <unk> using an improved <unk> measure adopted in N 
 the bureau said some N million fewer people would have fallen below the poverty line in N and the poverty rate would have been N N instead of N N under the alternative <unk>

 bally manufacturing corp. and new york developer donald trump have agreed in principle to a $ N million settlement of shareholder litigation stemming from bally 's alleged <unk> payment to mr. trump

 lawyers for shareholders bally and mr. trump all declined to talk publicly about the proposed settlement citing a request by a federal court <unk> not to reveal details of the agreement until it is completed 
 but some attorneys who are familiar with the matter said the $ N million payment will be shared by bally and mr. trump with the casino and hotel concern probably paying the bulk of the money 
 the amount bally and mr. trump will pay to settle the class-action suit <unk> in comparison to the $ N million walt disney co. and saul steinberg 's reliance group holdings inc. agreed to pay to settle a similar suit in july 
 that settlement represented the first time shareholders were granted a major payment in a <unk> case 
 mr. steinberg made a $ N million profit on the sale to disney of his investment in the company in N 
 but lawyers said mr. steinberg probably faced much more potential liability because when he sued disney during his takeover battle he filed on behalf of all shareholders 
 when disney offered to pay mr. steinberg a premium for his shares the new york investor did n't demand the company also pay a premium to other shareholders 
 when mr. trump sued bally he sued only on behalf of himself

 companies seeking to make insurers pay for pollution cleanup win court victory 
 in a case involving avondale industries inc. and its insurer travelers cos. the second u.s. circuit court of appeals in new york ruled in favor of the company on two issues that lawyers say are central to dozens of pollution cases around the country 
 travelers and other insurers have maintained that cleanup costs are n't damages and thus are n't covered under commercial policies 
 they also have argued that government proceedings <unk> a company of potential responsibility do n't fit the legal definition of a lawsuit thus such <unk> proceedings are n't covered by the policies the insurers say 
 the appeals court disagreed on both counts 
 avondale was notified by louisiana officials in N that it was potentially responsible for a cleanup at an <unk> plant 
 avondale asked travelers to defend it in the state proceeding but the insurer did n't respond 
 the appeals court upheld a district judge 's ruling that the insurer had to defend the company in such proceedings 
 the appeals court also said we think an ordinary businessman reading this policy would have believed himself covered for the demands and potential damage claims stemming from any cleanup 
 this decision will have a very considerable impact said kenneth <unk> professor of environmental law and insurance law at the university of virginia because many commercial insurance policies are issued by companies based in new york 
 william <unk> an attorney for the chemical manufacturers association said that while other appeals courts have ruled differently on whether cleanup costs are damages the influence of the appeals court in new york will make insurers sit up and listen 
 he said the decision was the first in which a federal appeals court has ruled whether administrative government proceedings qualify as litigation 
 barry r. <unk> an attorney for travelers said there are procedural bases on which this case will be appealed further

 also it has not yet been decided exactly how much of the mortgage <unk> will be able to convert into equity 
 convertible mortgages have become an increasingly popular way to finance prestigious buildings of late 
 in a convertible mortgage the investor <unk> the building owner a certain amount in return for the option to convert its interest into equity usually less than N N at the end of the loan term 
 during the term the lender can either receive a percentage of cash flow a percentage of the building 's appreciation or a fixed return 
 the main advantage of a convertible mortgage is that it is not a sale and therefore does not trigger costly transfer taxes and <unk> 
 sears said it would put the <unk> tower on the block almost a year ago as part of its anti-takeover restructuring 
 but japanese institutions <unk> away from bidding on the <unk> tower out of fear their purchase of the property would trigger <unk> sentiment 
 last summer sears appeared to have a deal with canadian developer olympia & york developments ltd 
 but that deal fell through in september after it became clear that the sale would lead to a major real estate tax <unk> raising property taxes and making it difficult to lease the building at competitive prices 
 real estate industry executives said sears ' investment banker goldman sachs & co. sought financing in japan 
 however japanese authorities apparently were concerned that a refinancing also would attract too much publicity 
 sears then went back to <unk> the boston pension adviser that had proposed a convertible debt deal during the first round of bids last spring 
 <unk> has $ N billion of real estate investments nationwide according to a spokesman 
 tandy corp. said it signed a definitive agreement to acquire two units of <unk> ab of stockholm for cash 
 the amount was n't disclosed 
 the electronics maker and retailer previously estimated the sale price at between $ N million and $ N million for <unk> 's victor <unk> and <unk> hand-held computer subsidiaries 
 in addition tandy will acquire rights to the victor and <unk> names for computers 
 during N the <unk> subsidiaries had combined sales in excess of $ N million 
 the transaction will give tandy a well-known european computer brand that includes N dealers and distributors marketing to medium-sized business and educational institutions 
 closing of the transaction is subject to certain conditions and regulatory approvals the company said 
 two rules in pending congressional legislation threaten to <unk> leveraged buy-outs by raising the price <unk> of such deals by as much as N N 
 wall street is <unk> over the rules which would curtail the tax <unk> of debt used in most lbos 
 the provisions in deficit-reduction bills recently passed by the house and senate could further cool the takeover boom that has been the driving force behind the bull market in stocks for much of the 1980s some tax experts and investment bankers argue 
 indeed some investment bankers have already started restructuring deals to cope with the expected rules 
 wall street has all but conceded on the issue and is now lobbying for the less onerous senate version of one of the provisions 
 at issue is the <unk> of certain junk bonds that are used in most lbos 
 such high-yield debt is similar to a zero-coupon bond in that it is sold at a discount to face value with interest <unk> instead of being paid to the holder 
 under current rules that accrued interest is deductible by the company issuing the debt 
 the house version of the legislation would kill that deduction and label any such debt as equity which is n't deductible 
 the <unk> senate version would defer the <unk> for roughly five years 
 you see these in just about every lbo said robert <unk> senior vice president in charge of tax issues at shearson lehman hutton inc. in new york 
 it becomes a source of cash for the company making the lbo because it gets a deduction and does n't have to repay the debt for several years 
 typically mr. <unk> estimates this type of debt makes up N N to N N of the financing for lbos 
 these types of bonds have been used in buy-outs of companies such as rjr nabisco inc. storer communications inc. and <unk> co 
 a second provision passed by the senate and house would eliminate a rule allowing companies that post losses resulting from lbo debt to receive refunds of taxes paid over the previous three years 
 for example if a company posted a loss of $ N million from buy-out interest payments the existing rule would allow the concern to be able to receive a refund from the tax it paid from N through N when it may have been a profitable public company 
 but that rule is being virtually <unk> by wall street which is concentrating on coping with the deduction issue 
 prices for lbos have to come down if you do n't have that feature argued lawrence <unk> managing director for merchant banking at donaldson lufkin & jenrette securities corp. in new york 
 several wall street officials say the proposed legislation already is having an impact 
 an investment group led by chicago 's <unk> family recently lowered a $ N billion bid for american medical international beverly hills calif. because of the threat of the legislation 
 moreover one investment banker who requested <unk> said his firm did n't raise the <unk> for a target company earlier this month after a stronger bid emerged from a public company that was n't concerned about the financing provision 
 we would have paid more if we thought that law was n't going to pass he said 
 one possible solution for wall street is to increase the equity part of the transaction that is give lenders a bigger stake in the surviving company rather than just interest payments 
 that would force the buy-out firm and the target company 's management to reduce their level of ownership 
 the pigs in the trough may have to give a little bit of the <unk> back and then the deal can go through said peter c. <unk> tax partner at <unk> lipton rosen & katz 
 another solution said a tax lawyer who requested <unk> is for firms to use convertible bonds that sell at a discount 
 since they have a lower interest rate they would n't fall under the junk-bond category that would lose its <unk> 
 the house version of the bill would make debt <unk> if it pays five percentage points above treasury notes has at least a five-year maturity and does n't pay interest for at least one year out of the first five 
 the bill would then declare that the debt is equity and therefore is n't deductible 
 the senate bill would only deny the deduction until interest is actually paid 
 currently even though the issuer does n't pay tax the debt holder is taxed on the accrued interest 
 but those holders are often foreign investors and tax-exempt pension funds that do n't pay taxes on their holdings 
 the senate estimates that its version of the provision would yield $ N million the first year and a total of $ N million over five years 
 the house version would raise slightly more 
 even if wall street finds ways around the new rules a senate aide contends lbos will become somewhat more difficult 
 there 's no question it will make lbos more expensive he said 
 the interest deduction was the engine that made these things more productive 
 the average publicly offered commodity fund fell N N in september largely because of the volatile markets in foreign currencies according to norwood securities 
 the firm said that losers outnumbered gainers by more than three to one among the N funds it tracks 
 for the first nine months of the year norwood said the average fund has lost N N 
 the government moved aggressively to open the <unk> of federal aid for victims of the california earthquake but its <unk> of emergency funds must be <unk> soon if the aid is to continue 
 president bush signed a disaster declaration covering seven northern california counties 
 the declaration immediately made the counties eligible for temporary housing grants and low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses 
 in addition an unusually wide array of federal agencies moved to provide specialized assistance 
 the department of housing and urban development prepared to make as many as N vacant houses available for those left homeless the agriculture department was set to <unk> food from the <unk> program to earthquake victims and the pentagon was providing everything from radio communications to blood <unk> to military police for <unk> traffic 
 but the pool of federal <unk> funds already is running low because of the heavy costs of cleaning up hurricane hugo and congress will be under pressure to <unk> more money quickly 
 in hugo 's wake congress allocated $ N billion in relief funds and white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said $ N million of that money remains and could be diverted for quick expenditures related to the earthquake 
 now though enormous costs for earthquake relief will pile on top of outstanding costs for hurricane relief 
 that obviously means that we wo n't have enough for all of the <unk> that are now facing us and we will have to consider appropriate requests for <unk> funding mr. fitzwater said 
 the federal government is n't even attempting yet to estimate how much the earthquake will cost it 
 but mr. fitzwater said there will be i think quite obviously a very large amount of money required from all levels of government 
 in congress lawmakers already are looking for ways to add relief funds 
 money could be added to a pending spending bill covering the federal emergency management agency which <unk> federal disaster relief 
 more likely relief funds could be added to an omnibus spending bill that congress is to begin considering next week 
 but it is n't just washington 's relief dollars that are spread thin its relief manpower also is stretched 
 fema still has special disaster centers open to handle the aftermath of hugo and spokesman russell <unk> acknowledged that we 're pretty thin 
 mr. <unk> says fema now possibly may have the heaviest <unk> in its history 
 to further complicate relief efforts the privately funded american red cross also finds itself strapped for funds after its big hugo operation 
 it 's been a bad month <unk> and every other way said <unk> stewart a spokeswoman for the red cross 
 it just makes it a little rough when you have to worry about the budget 
 the red cross has opened N shelters in the bay area serving N people 
 <unk> trucks capable of cooking food were dispatched from other states 
 all the precise types of federal aid that will be sent to california wo n't be determined until state officials make specific requests to fema agency officials said 
 and in the confusion after the earthquake the information flow is a little slow coming in from the affected area said carl <unk> a fema spokesman 
 still some aid is moving <unk> from washington almost immediately 
 hud officials said they will make available as many as N bay area houses that are under hud loans but now are vacant after the houses have been <unk> to ensure they are sound 
 additional housing <unk> and certificates will be made available officials said and some housing and <unk> funds may be shifted from other programs or made available for emergency use 
 another federal agency not normally associated with disaster relief the internal revenue service moved quickly as well 
 the irs said it will waive certain tax penalties for earthquake victims unable to meet return deadlines or make payments because of the quake 's devastation 
 the agency plans to announce specific relief procedures in the coming days 
 and the treasury said residents of the san francisco area will be able to cash in savings bonds even if they have n't held them for the minimum six-month period 
 one advantage that federal officials have in handling earthquake relief is the large number of military facilities in the san francisco bay area facilities that provide a ready base of supplies and workers 
 even before the full extent of the devastation was known defense secretary dick cheney ordered the military services to set up an emergency command center in the pentagon and prepare to respond to various fema requests for assistance 
 by yesterday afternoon air force transport planes began moving additional rescue and medical supplies physicians communications equipment and fema personnel to california 
 a military jet flew a congressional delegation and senior bush administration officials to survey the damage 
 and the pentagon said dozens of additional crews and transport aircraft were on alert awaiting orders to move emergency supplies 
 two air force facilities near sacramento and <unk> air force base N miles northeast of san francisco were designated to serve as <unk> centers 
 some victims also were treated at the <unk> army medical center in san francisco and at the naval hospital in oakland 
 in addition N military police from the <unk> a military base in san francisco are <unk> with traffic control and a navy ship was moved from a naval station at <unk> island near the bay bridge to san francisco to help fight fires 
 to help residents in northern california rebuild fema intends to set up N disaster assistance offices in the earthquake area in the next several days and to staff them with N to N workers from various agencies said robert <unk> chief of the agency 's individual assistance division 
 at these offices earthquake victims will be helped in filling out a <unk> form that they will need to qualify for such federal assistance as <unk> loans and to repair houses 
 and federal officials are promising to move rapidly with federal highway aid to rebuild the area 's severely damaged road system 
 the federal highway administration has an emergency relief program to help states and local governments repair federally funded highways and bridges seriously damaged by natural disasters 
 the account currently has $ N million 
 and though federal law <unk> that only $ N million can be <unk> from that fund in any one state per disaster administration officials expect congress to move in to <unk> spending more now in california 
 to get that money states must go through an elaborate approval process but officials expect red tape to be cut this time 
 keith <unk> special assistant to federal highway administrator thomas <unk> also said that after the N san fernando earthquake in southern california the state set tougher standards for bridges and with federal aid began a program to <unk> highways and bridges for earthquake hazards 
 the first phase of the program has been completed but two other <unk> are continuing 
 the two major structures that failed tuesday night he said were both built well before the N earthquake the san francisco bay bridge completed in the 1930s and the section of <unk> built in the 1950s

 silicon valley <unk> a sigh of relief yesterday 
 though details were <unk> in the aftermath of the violent earthquake that shook the high-tech <unk> along with the rest of the san francisco bay area a spot check of computer makers turned up little if any potentially <unk> damage to facilities or fabrication equipment 
 analysts and corporate officials said they expected practically no long-term disruption in shipments from the valley of either hardware or software goods 
 intel corp. advanced micro devices inc. and national semiconductor corp. were all up and running yesterday though many workers were forced to stay home because of damaged roadways others elected to take the day off

 sun microsystems inc. and tandem computers inc. also signaled that they should recover quickly

 none sustained significant damage a spokesman said adding that the delicate manufacturing process machines were <unk> and were all found to be operating normally 
 for many companies of course there is still a slew of nagging problems to <unk> with some of which have the potential to become quite serious 
 for example a spokesman for advanced micro devices said the sunnyvale chip maker is worried about <unk> 
 a sudden surge or drop in electric power could <unk> integrated circuits being built 
 but given what might have happened to the fragile parts that are at the heart of the <unk> business the bulk of valley companies seemed to be just about shouting <unk> 
 several factors apparently <unk> the valley a <unk> suburban stretch from san jose to palo alto from the kind of impact felt in san francisco an hour 's drive north 
 for one thing buildings there tend to be newer and thus in step with the latest safety codes 
 also the soil in the valley is solid unlike the landfill of san francisco 's downtown marina district which was hit with fires and vast destruction 
 in addition some <unk> companies said they were prepared for <unk> conditions like tuesday 's 
 their machine tools are even <unk> to the shop floor 
 intel said that over the past decade it has installed computer <unk> and <unk> <unk> sensitive to the shake of an earthquake in the pipes that <unk> through its plants 
 like other large valley companies intel also noted that it has factories in several parts of the nation so that a breakdown at one location should n't leave customers in a total <unk> 
 that 's certainly good news for such companies as compaq computer corp. houston which has only a four-day supply of microprocessors from the valley on hand because of a <unk> manufacturing approach that limits the buildup of inventory

 john r. <unk> <unk> to this article 
 michael maynard offered the world a faster way to break eggs 
 as thanks the egg industry tried to break him 
 and the egg producers have done a pretty good job 
 they tried to put mr. maynard out of business by an act of congress 
 <unk> lobbying helped persuade six states to ban mr. maynard 's automatic <unk> machine because of fears over salmonella 
 his company <unk> manufacturing inc. was forced to seek protection from creditors under federal bankruptcy law in N and has since been liquidated 
 monthly sales of his egg king machine which he now is marketing through a new company have <unk> to about half a dozen from a peak of N says the <unk> businessman 
 mr. maynard is n't the first entrepreneur to <unk> up against entrenched interests 
 but his case is notable both for the scale of the fight it is n't often that a congressional hearing is held to determine whether one small businessman is a threat to the republic and for what it tells about the <unk> of marketing a new product 
 now one might ask why people who sell eggs would fight someone who is trying to make it easier to crack them 
 part of the answer lies in the nature of the industry 
 many larger egg producers are also egg processors who crack <unk> and <unk> billions of eggs turning them into <unk> <unk> or frozen egg products 
 however dozens of <unk> restaurant chefs and other food <unk> who <unk> to mr. maynard 's defense say that products ranging from egg bread to <unk> lose some zip when the eggs come in <unk> cans instead of <unk> 
 but for companies that use hundreds of eggs a day breaking them by hand can get well out of hand 
 the idea behind the egg king is pretty simple put the eggs into a <unk> that contains <unk> baskets spin them at a high speed to break the <unk> and strain the <unk> part through the baskets 
 one egg king which at just under four feet tall and two feet wide has been <unk> to the robot <unk> can crack about N eggs an hour 
 because fresh eggs are less expensive than processed ones a big egg user can recover the egg king 's $ N cost in a few months says mr. maynard 
 such <unk> egg breakers have been around since the <unk> 
 but when mr. maynard came forward with his machine in the early 1970s nobody else was offering them in the u.s. 
 the main reason salmonella 
 <unk> carry this bacteria which can cause upset <unk> and in rare cases death among people 
 <unk> sometimes pass salmonella to the eggs and it can also be found on <unk> <unk> 
 thus any machine that breaks large amounts of eggs at once has the potential to spread salmonella if a bad egg gets in with the good ones 
 mr. maynard claims this is a <unk> problem 
 the egg king carries written instructions to break only high-grade eggs that have been properly <unk> and as an added <unk> to use the eggs only in products that will be <unk> enough to kill bacteria 
 with nearly N machines in use there have been no salmonella problems as long as instructions were followed mr. maynard boasts 
 he says the handful of salmonella cases involving products that may have used eggs broken by an egg king stemmed from a failure to adequately cook the products 
 but he says that 's no more a reason for banning egg <unk> than bad drivers are a reason for banning cars 
 opponents do n't buy such arguments 
 human nature being what it is people do n't always follow instructions says jack <unk> chief of food protection for the new york state health department 
 leading the assault against the egg king has been united egg producers 
 the <unk> ga. trade group has issued a briefing book that claims the machine is a health hazard and that mr. maynard is trying to make a fast buck at the expense of the nation 's egg producers 
 the <unk> declines to comment but the group 's attorney alfred <unk> says the group 's actions are motivated solely by health concerns 
 an early <unk> was the u.s. department of agriculture 
 mr. maynard initially won approval for his machine to be used at <unk> facilities regulated by the <unk> 's food safety inspection service 
 unfortunately for mr. maynard another branch of the <unk> the agricultural marketing service was in charge of eggs 
 after receiving complaints from egg producers this branch got the other branch to <unk> its approval thus limiting the machine 's potential market to <unk> and restaurants and other <unk> that are n't regulated by the <unk> 
 the egg producers also lobbied the food and drug administration 
 but the fda in a N letter to the united egg producers said that there was little likelihood of a health problem as long as instructions were followed 
 so the producers went to capitol hill where a congressman from georgia introduced a measure to ban <unk> <unk> machines 
 mr. maynard whose company at the time was based in santa ana calif. <unk> his local congressman and the battle was joined 
 mr. maynard 's forces finally defeated the measure though it took a vote on the floor of the house of representatives to do it 
 even then opponents managed to get a congressional hearing to examine what one congressman called an unscrupulous method for breaking eggs 
 <unk> in their effort to get a national ban the egg producers turned their attention to the states 
 so far new york new jersey nebraska georgia michigan and minnesota have outlawed mr. maynard 's device citing health concerns 
 an antitrust suit that mr. maynard 's company filed in los angeles federal court against the united egg producers and others only added to the entrepreneur 's woes 
 the judge dismissed the suit and ordered mr. maynard 's company to pay over $ N in legal fees to the defendants ' lawyers 
 mr. maynard says the ruling pushed his company into bankruptcy court 
 now he has moved to oklahoma where costs are lower and started a new company <unk> inc. to market his machine 
 but so far the change of <unk> has n't ended his string of bad breaks 
 mr. maynard recently fell from a horse and <unk> his arm 
 <unk> pfeiffer ca n't <unk> gum and <unk> at the same time 
 but on the evidence of the <unk> baker boys that may be the only thing she ca n't do at least when she 's acting in movies 
 as the tough <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> baker boys ms. pfeiffer <unk> for herself and more than <unk> well 
 her <unk> diamond handles a song the way the <unk> do like she 's hearing the way it should sound inside her head and she 's concentrating on matching that internal tone 
 yet her intensity stops and starts with the music 
 when she is n't performing for an audience she prepares for a song by removing the <unk> of gum from her mouth and indicates that she 's finished by sticking the gum back in 
 like almost everything in this <unk> romantic and <unk> movie ms. pfeiffer 's <unk> seems like someone you 've seen before in numerous <unk> stories even her name <unk> diamond sounds like a character <unk> <unk> must have played 
 yet nothing about baker boys and certainly nothing about ms. pfeiffer really is like something from the video vault 
 steve <unk> the young writer and director he is n't yet N has only one produced picture to his credit he wrote the <unk> for racing with the moon a lovely <unk> picture set in the <unk> 
 both movies are <unk> with the <unk> <unk> of someone much older someone who does n't dismiss dreams but who also has enough experience to see his limits 
 however mr. <unk> directs his own material without <unk> and at its own <unk> pace baker boys is both <unk> and funny 
 he 's put a fresh spin on material that could come off <unk> <unk> for example the way <unk> <unk> an audience the first time she <unk> with the baker boys 
 of course it does n't hurt that mr. <unk> has made up for his lack of experience behind the camera with technicians who know exactly what they 're doing 
 much of the picture 's <unk> emerges from <unk> michael <unk> 's <unk> <unk> lens work 
 after working for years with werner <unk> <unk> the late german director and more recently with martin <unk> after hours the color of money the last temptation of <unk> mr. <unk> has developed a <unk> <unk> style 
 and dave <unk> 's <unk> score <unk> the <unk> requirements of <unk> <unk> feelings is a must without <unk> 
 though ms. pfeiffer has the flashy part she gets the best comic <unk> and to wear glamorous <unk> and <unk> heels the boys are pretty great too 
 what seemed like a good idea to cast the bridges brothers jeff and <unk> as the baker brothers actually turned out to be a good idea 
 anyone who 's tried to appear natural in front of a camera knows that it 's much more natural to end up looking like a stiff 
 so it 's quite possible that the <unk> play between the brothers is n't natural at all that jeff and <unk> had to work like crazy to make their <unk> love and <unk> and frustration and rage seem so very real 
 when the movie opens the baker brothers are doing what they 've done for N years <unk> and twice as long as that for themselves they 're playing <unk> piano face-to-face on <unk> <unk> 
 they 're small time in the small <unk> not the best ones and restaurants in seattle 
 yet they do n't <unk> their audiences by <unk> their act 
 they wear <unk> most nights unless circumstances a regular <unk> at a <unk> <unk> for example require them to wear special <unk> like <unk> shirts 
 <unk> <unk> looking eager to please with his <unk> <unk> and round face plays the older brother frank 
 frank plans the program takes care of business and approaches the work like any other job 
 he 's even able to think of a job that takes him out of the house N nights a week as an ordinary job 
 he 's got a wife and two kids and a house in the <unk> the audience sees only the house and only near the end of the movie 
 frank <unk> a little for the <unk> probably no more or less than he would have to if he worked for a big corporation 
 on his <unk> he wears <unk> <unk> 
 jeff bridges is the younger brother jack who <unk> himself the <unk> artist he lives in a <unk> with his sick dog and the <unk> visit from the little girl <unk> who <unk> down the fire escape 
 yet jack 's the one who can remember every dive they ever played and when and he <unk> shows up for work night after night he <unk> himself with <unk> and by showing up at the last minute 
 looking <unk> than he has in a while the younger mr. bridges 's jack is <unk> and <unk> and a far <unk> case than frank who 's managed to <unk> his dreams to fit reality without feeling too <unk> 
 he can live with little <unk> 
 mr. <unk> has put together some <unk> moments

 here she <unk> especially during her <unk> awful <unk> of the candy man which she <unk> while <unk> around in a little cotton candy <unk> <unk> <unk> that could n't be more perfect 
 it matches her voice 
 and ms. pfeiffer 's particular version of making <unk> and the way mr. <unk> photographs her from the tips of her red high heels right up her <unk> red <unk> dress might make you think of <unk> <unk> if ms. pfeiffer had n't gone and become a star in her own right

 money-market mutual fund assets grew at nearly three times their usual rate in the latest week as investors opted for safety instead of the stock market 
 money-fund assets soared $ N billion in the week ended tuesday to a record $ N billion according to <unk> 's money fund report a <unk> <unk> newsletter 
 we were expecting it following the fall of the dow friday said <unk> <unk> <unk> editor of money fund report 
 it 's the <unk> flight to safety 
 despite recent declines in interest rates money funds continue to offer better yields than other comparable investments 
 the average seven-day compound yield on the N taxable funds tracked by <unk> 's was N N in the latest week down from N N 
 compound yields assume reinvestment of dividends and that current yields continue for a year 
 most short-term certificates of deposit are yielding about N N or less at major banks and the yields on treasury bills sold at monday 's auction fell to N N for three months and N N for six months 
 money-fund assets have been rising at an average rate of $ N billion a week in recent months ms. <unk> said reflecting the relatively high yields 
 in the latest week funds open to institutions alone grew by $ N billion 
 some fund managers say inflows could increase in coming days as a result of stock selling in the wake of friday 's N point drop in the dow jones industrial average 
 if you 're selling equities you do n't start getting proceeds for five to seven days said frank <unk> who manages the kemper money market fund 
 neal <unk> marketing vice president for fidelity investments said inflows friday into fidelity 's <unk> and cash reserves money-market funds were about twice normal levels with about half coming from equity and junk-bond funds 
 monday and tuesday were lackluster in comparison he said 
 people are n't necessarily running scared mr. <unk> said 
 they 're maintaining their attitude toward investing which has <unk> toward the conservative recently 
 money-fund yields tend to lag <unk> trends as portfolio managers adjust the maturities of their investments short-term treasury securities commercial paper and the like to capture the highest yields 
 maturities usually are shorter when rates are rising and longer when they are falling 
 the average maturity of the funds tracked by <unk> 's remained at N days for the third consecutive week 
 it was as short as N days at the start of this year when rates were <unk> steadily upward and hit N days in august 
 the average seven-day simple yield of the funds fell to N N this week from N N 
 the average 30-day simple yield was N N compared with N N the week before and the 30-day compound yield slid to N N from N N 
 some funds are posting yields far higher than the average

 whose della femina mcnamee wcrs agency created <unk> joe <unk> among others announced a massive restructuring that largely <unk> it from the advertising business and includes selling the majority of its advertising unit to <unk> eurocom 
 the complex restructuring which was long expected <unk> london-based wcrs from primarily a <unk> of advertising into one of europe 's largest buyers of advertising time and space 
 it also creates a newly merged world-wide ad agency controlled by eurocom and headed jointly by new york ad man jerry della femina and two top wcrs executives 
 the merged agency 's <unk> ambitious goal to become one of the world 's N largest agencies while attracting more multinational clients than the agencies were able to attract alone 
 wcrs 's restructuring reflects the growing importance of media buying in europe where the only way to get a good price on advertising time and space is to buy it in bulk 
 for eurocom meanwhile the move gives it a strong u.s. <unk> in della femina and more than <unk> the size of its ad agency business world-wide 
 it also gives the outspoken mr. della femina who often generates as much publicity for himself as for his clients an international platform that he most certainly wo n't be loath to use 
 according to terms wcrs will pay N billion french francs $ N million for the N N it does n't already own of carat holding s.a. one of europe 's largest media buyers 
 meanwhile eurocom which had held N N of wcrs 's ad unit will pay # N million $ N million to raise its stake to N N 
 that price also covers eurocom raising to N N its N N stake in europe 's <unk> group a joint venture ad agency network it owns with wcrs 
 eurocom will also have the right to buy the remaining N N of the merged ad agency group in six years 
 the transaction places the three executives <unk> at the helm of a major agency with the rather <unk> name of eurocom wcrs della femina ball ltd. or <unk> 
 the merged agency will include della femina mcnamee based in new york eurocom 's various agencies in france the <unk> group in europe and wcrs 's other advertising and direct marketing operations 
 mr. della femina will be joint chairman with former wcrs executive robin <unk> 
 both will report to tim <unk> a former wcrs executive who will be chief executive officer at the new agency 
 in an interview in new york mr. <unk> fresh from a <unk> flight from paris where executives had worked through most of the night outlined big plans for the new agency 
 our goal is to develop quite rapidly to a <unk> position by the end of three years from now 
 it implies very dramatic growth he said 
 he added that eurocom and wcrs had agreed to provide a development fund of # N million for acquisitions 
 the new agency group is already in discussions about a possible purchase in spain while mr. <unk> said it also plans to make acquisitions in <unk> germany and elsewhere 
 <unk> the top N within three years will be difficult at best 
 della femina had billings of just $ N million last year and ranked as the u.s. 's <unk> ad agency 
 the merged company that it now becomes part of will have billings of just more than $ N billion most of that in europe bringing it to about <unk> world-wide 
 to make it to <unk> status it would have to <unk> over such <unk> forces as grey advertising d'arcy <unk> benton & <unk> and <unk> 's ddb needham 
 the merged agency 's game plan to attract multinational packaged-goods advertisers may prove equally difficult 
 when wcrs created della femina mcnamee out of the merger of three smaller agency units in N it said it did so in order to attract larger clients especially packaged-goods companies 
 since then della femina won pan am as an international client and also does work for a few packaged-goods clients including dow chemical co. 's <unk> wrap 
 but major packaged-goods players of the world such as procter & gamble colgate-palmolive and unilever have <unk> <unk> the agency 
 three of our favorite names mr. della femina calls that <unk> adding hopefully we 're a much more attractive agency to large <unk> today than we were yesterday 
 still the restructuring could create one of the most powerful alliances between advertising and <unk> firms that europe has seen 
 as part of the restructuring wcrs and eurocom said they will look for ways to combine their media buying across europe 
 what 's more both eurocom and brothers francis and <unk> gross who founded carat will acquire N N stakes in wcrs group creating a powerful link between eurocom and carat 
 carat will receive its wcrs stake as part of payment for the N N carat stake that wcrs is buying while eurocom said it expects to pay about # N million for its wcrs stake 
 mr. della femina says he plans to remain heavily involved in the creative product at the world-wide agency serving as a sort of creative <unk> 
 <unk> mcnamee della femina 's president will continue running the u.s. agency day-to-day 
 they and other top executives signed long-term employment contracts and mr. della femina will receive an additional multimillion-dollar sum which some industry executives pegged at about $ N million 
 wcrs group for its part will now be able to follow its longstanding plan of becoming a holding company for a series of <unk> businesses said peter scott the firm 's chief executive 
 in addition to carat wcrs will hold onto its public relations tv programming and other businesses 
 wcrs says its debt will be cut to # N million from # N million as a result of the transaction 
 for carat meanwhile the alliance with eurocom and wcrs is intended to strengthen its own push outside france 
 carat 's gross brothers invented the idea of large-scale buying of media space 
 by buying the space in bulk they obtain discounts as high as N N which they can pass on to customers 
 they thus have won the french <unk> business of such advertising giants as coca-cola co. fiat s.p a. gillette and kodak 
 but now other agencies are getting into the business with their own competing <unk> groups and carat wants to expand to the rest of europe 
 to help finance the carat purchase wcrs said it plans an issue of <unk> preferred shares once the market <unk> down 
 but wcrs added that in the light of the current uncertainty in the equity markets it has arranged <unk> debt financing which would be underwritten by samuel <unk> & co. ltd 
 earthquake 's damage

 honda motor co. the first japanese auto maker to ship cars to japan from the u.s. is now exporting more than N accord <unk> a year from its <unk> ohio factory 
 one of the most remarkable features of the forced <unk> of the ethnic <unk> out of <unk> over the past five months has been the lack of international attention 
 the <unk> of more than N men women and children by the <unk> regime adds up to one of the largest <unk> seen in the postwar years 
 yet some people are advancing a <unk> <unk> that what we are seeing is somehow the <unk> result of the historical <unk> committed by the <unk> in the <unk> century 
 today 's <unk> in <unk> in other words deserve what is coming to them four centuries later 
 as if this were n't enough the senate judiciary committee is getting into the act 
 on tuesday it approved senator bob dole 's proposed <unk> resolution <unk> april N N as the national day of <unk> of the <unk> anniversary of the <unk> <unk> of N suffered at the hands of the <unk> <unk> empire 
 there can be no <unk> that the <unk> <unk> terrible suffering but one has to wonder what possible good such a resolution will achieve 
 it puts great strain on a longstanding u.s. friendship with turkey a country that has been one of america 's strongest allies in nato 
 the resolution also comes at a time when turkey has been seeking help from the united states in <unk> its <unk> emigration controversy and pursuing democratic reforms that may lead to membership in the european community 
 turkey has been fighting its past for years and thus far has been only partially successful 
 must it now accept that one of its strongest allies blames it for the <unk> of another people 
 such sentiment only encourages the adverse feelings toward turkey that surfaced when turkey asked for assistance in dealing with its <unk> emigration crisis 
 mr. dole 's odd effort notwithstanding most of turkey 's political problems lie with the europeans 
 part of the problem some europeans have with turkey seems to stem from its location turkey is n't really part of europe 
 why they wonder should it belong to the ec 
 another <unk> hook is the <unk> faith of the majority of the <unk> people turkey we are told is not a christian nation its people simply wo n't fit in with the western european <unk> tradition 
 it 's when these <unk> fall on <unk> <unk> that the old <unk> of <unk> for treatment at the hands of the <unk> empire comes to the <unk> 
 no one has to accept the <unk> of the <unk> empire to reject that argument 
 turkey in any event is long past it 
 the country has in recent years accepted more than N refugees from at least four <unk> nations 
 <unk> suffering what many people consider to be a current <unk> campaign at the hands of <unk> iran and <unk> have <unk> eastern turkey 
 now it is their fellow <unk> <unk> as refugees from <unk> 
 the <unk> <unk> tragedy and the ongoing crisis can not be ignored and <unk> off to that notorious <unk> of history that has become so convenient recently 
 surely the past suffering of any people at any time can not be simply filed away and forgotten 
 but what the senate judiciary committee has done in supporting the strongly <unk> <unk> resolution <unk> no useful end it merely produces more controversy and <unk> memories 
 congress has enough difficulty dealing with the realities of the world as it currently exists 
 <unk> 's government has been <unk> beyond the pale for months and the u.s. does its values no credit by ignoring that while casting its votes into the past 
 many in washington say president bush will have to raise taxes to pay for his war on drugs 
 we have a better idea <unk> hud to pay for the war on drugs 
 housing and urban development 's budget is $ N billion 
 from what we and the nation have been reading the money is n't being spent very well 
 the single most important contribution the government could make now to help the poor is to get the specter of drugs out of their neighborhoods 
 if that takes money take it away from this <unk> federal department 
 but of course the democrats <unk> hud in hearings and in the press have no such solution in mind 
 instead they 're scrambling to protect the very programs at the heart of the hud scandal 
 this month hud secretary jack kemp unveiled a series of proposed reforms to improve management at hud 
 no doubt many of his ideas are worthy but ultimately he is proposing to make fundamentally flawed programs work slightly more fairly and efficiently 
 congress is unlikely to go even that far 
 last week secretary kemp ran into a <unk> of criticism from house banking committee members 
 they were <unk> for instance that he wanted to target more of the $ N billion community development block grant <unk> program to low-income projects and zero out the notorious discretionary funds that have allowed hud officials to steer contracts to political <unk> 
 these development grants mainly <unk> developers who want to put up shopping centers and parking <unk> 
 they also give those in congress political credit for bringing home the pork and so they are popular with such members as mary rose <unk> 
 rep. <unk> a democrat from cleveland wants a $ N million grant so cleveland can build an <unk> rock and roll hall of fame 
 she says it 'd create N jobs and bring cleveland tourist revenue 
 hud says the project does n't qualify and mr. kemp says that rock <unk> roll musicians and the music industry ought to put up the money 
 at the hearing rep. <unk> started <unk> about <unk> <unk> regulations that would stand between her and housing for downtown cleveland 
 rep. <unk> <unk> an ohio republican rallied to the cause i think the <unk> is making an important statement 
 the implication that if a congressman calls about a project in his district there 's something wrong i think is most unfortunate 
 we 're sure some <unk> can explain the difference between what the republican consultants have been doing with hud and what these <unk> and <unk> want to do with hud 
 our view is that given congress 's attitude toward hud the place probably is beyond reform 
 for more than N years the federal government has tried various ways to provide housing for the poor and revive cities 
 in the process hud has wasted <unk> billions created <unk> and invited corruption 
 much of hud 's spending actually is <unk> welfare for developers or the middle class 
 that includes the <unk> funds and the federal housing administration which loans out money for private home mortgages and has just been discovered to be $ N billion in the hole 
 selling the fha 's loan portfolio to the highest bidder would save the taxpayers <unk> billions in future losses 
 some hud money actually does <unk> down to the poor and <unk> out housing middlemen would free up more money for public housing tenants to manage and even own their units 
 the rest ought to be used to clean out drugs from the <unk> 
 rival gangs have turned cities into combat zones 
 even suburban prince george 's county md. reported last week there have been a record N killings there this year most of them drug-related 
 innocent <unk> often are the victims 
 a man in a <unk> was <unk> down in the <unk> of a miami drug battle 
 a <unk> brooklyn boy was used as a shield by a drug dealer 
 decent life in the inner cities wo n't be restored unless the government <unk> the streets from the drug gangs 
 until then the billions hud spends on inner-city housing simply is wasted 
 it 's still unclear whether secretary kemp wants to completely overhaul the engine room at hud or just tighten a few <unk> here and there 
 no doubt he believes the place can be <unk> 
 having seen the <unk> with which congress has addressed the hud scandals we disagree 
 it 's time to scrap the politically <unk> spending machine hud has become and channel the resources into the drug war

 natural <unk> and most particularly earthquakes are not only horrible realities in and of themselves but also <unk> through which the state of a society can be <unk> 
 the rubble after the <unk> earthquake a year ago disclosed quite literally a city whose larger structures had been built with sand 
 the extent of the disaster stemmed from years of <unk> and bureaucratic <unk> 
 the larger parallel after the earthquake centered south of san francisco is surely with the state of the u.s. economy

 the financial equivalent of the sand used by those <unk> contractors is junk bonds and the leveraged buy-outs associated with them 
 builders get away with using sand and financiers junk when society decides it 's <unk> necessary even to look the other way 
 and by the early 1980s u.s. capitalists had ample reason to welcome junk bonds to look the other way 
 by that time they found extremely low profit rates from <unk> corporate investment 
 government statistics in fact show that the profit rate net pretax profits divided by capital stock peaked in N at N N 
 that same <unk> saw profit rates fall to N N in the recession year N and the supposed <unk> that followed has seen the profit rate rise only to N N in N and N N in N 
 corresponding to the fall in profit rates was in the early 1980s the drop in the number arrived at if you divide the market value of firms by the replacement costs of their assets the famous <unk> ratio associated with prof. james <unk> 
 in theory the value attached to a firm by the market and the cost of replacing its assets should be the same 
 but of course the market could decide that the firm 's capital stock its assets means nothing if the firm is not producing profits 
 this is indeed what the market decided 
 by N the ratio was N N meaning that the market was <unk> every dollar 's worth of the average firm 's assets at N cents 
 from the history of capitalism we can take it as a sound bet that if it takes only N cents to buy a dollar 's worth of a firm 's capital stock an alert entrepreneur wo n't look the other way 
 his assumption is that the underlying profitability rate will go up and the capital assets he bought on the cheap will soon be producing profits thus restoring the market 's faith in them 
 hence the lbo craze 
 but here is where the entrepreneur made a very risky bet and where society was maybe <unk> to look the other way 
 the profit rate is still low and the <unk> ratio was only N N in N and N N in N 
 result a landscape <unk> with <unk> huge debt burdens <unk> down upon the <unk> and <unk> of corporate america 
 the mounting risks did not go <unk> even in the mid-1980s 
 but there were enough <unk> announcing the end of history in this case suspension of normal laws of economic <unk> for society to continue <unk> its eyes 
 mainstream economists and <unk> <unk> their <unk> up at the great <unk> of junk financing <unk> their heads to watch the <unk> of leveraged buy-outs claimed the end result would be a <unk> <unk> corporate america with soaring productivity and profits and the weaker gone to the wall 
 but this is not where the rewards of junk financing were found 
 the beneficiaries were those financiers whose <unk> was the topic figure of '80s capitalism michael <unk> 's $ N million salary in one year 
 <unk> economists i associate with <unk> in the union of radical political economists most particularly robert <unk> of the economics faculty at the university of california at <unk> were not <unk> in the manner of their <unk> colleagues 
 all along they have been noting the tremors and pointing out the underlying realities 
 profit rates after the great merger wave are no higher and now we have an extremely high-interest burden relative to cash flow 
 the consequences of building <unk> with sand are showing up 
 in contrast to previous estimates <unk> the default rate on junk bonds at N N or N N a harvard study published in april of this year and discussed in a lead story in the wall street journal for sept. N found the default rate on these junk bonds is N N 
 what is the consequence of a high-interest burden high default rates and continued low profitability 
 corporations need liquidity in the form of borrowed funds 
 without liquidity from the junk-bond market or cash flow from profits they look to the government which <unk> <unk> the natural <unk> of the capitalist economy with charity in the form of cuts in the capital-gains tax rate or <unk> 
 the consequence can be inflation brought on as the effect of a desperate bid to avoid the <unk> shock of a sudden crash 
 attacks on inflation come with another strategy of capital of a very traditional sort an assault on wages 
 mr. <unk> <unk> through <unk> at the end of history said in his <unk> that the class issue has actually been successfully resolved in the west 
 the <unk> of modern america represents the essential achievement of the <unk> society <unk> by <unk> 
 mr. <unk> might want to <unk> some american workers on the subject of class and <unk> 
 from its peak in N of $ N the average american weekly wage had fallen to $ N in N both figures being expressed in N dollars 
 in other words after the glory boom of the reagan years wages had <unk> from the post world war ii peak by N N as capitalists helped by the government turned down the <unk> or went offshore 
 but there are signs now the strikes by miners boeing workers telephone workers etc. that this attack on wages is being more fiercely resisted 
 these are long-term richter <unk> on american capitalism 
 the whole structure is extremely shaky 
 governments have become sophisticated in handling moments of panic a word the london times <unk> my father to use when he was reporting the wall street crash in N 
 but <unk> has its limits 
 the s&l bailout could cost $ N billion computing interest on the government 's loans 
 these are real costs 
 under what <unk> will the federal deposit insurance corporation <unk> 
 capitalism may now be engineered to withstand sudden shocks but there are fault lines the crisis in profits the assault on wages the structural <unk> of the system that make <unk> of those who claim that the future is here and that history is over

 japan air lines lufthansa german airlines and air france reportedly plan to form an international air-freight company this year a move that could further consolidate the industry 
 japanese newspaper <unk> <unk> <unk> reported that the three giants plan to integrate their cargo computers and <unk> and <unk> systems 
 they reportedly will invest a total of N billion yen $ N million in the venture whose headquarters would be in france or west germany 
 the action follows federal express corp. 's acquisition of flying tiger line inc. in august 
 after that it would make sense for airlines to talk about doing things jointly said cotton daly director of cargo services for new york consulting firm <unk> <unk> & <unk> inc 
 mr. daly said such discussions are motivated by the competitive threat posed by federal express united parcel service of america inc. and other fast-growing air-freight companies 
 many airlines are talking about cargo ventures and there have been rumors about such a tie between jal and european airlines 
 in tokyo a jal spokesman said he could n't confirm or deny the latest japanese report 
 but he said jal is talking to lufthansa and air france about some sort of cargo venture 
 it is just one of a number of strategies jal has <unk> upon to come to terms with the situation in europe after N the deadline for ending trade barriers in the ec he said 
 in frankfurt a lufthansa spokesman confirmed talks are under way but declined to comment 
 a lufthansa spokeswoman in tokyo said the head of lufthansa 's cargo operations had been in <unk> last week for talks with jal 
 in paris air france declined to comment 
 nothing is defined or signed at this point mr. daly said of the talks 
 whatever accord the three carriers reach he said he is skeptical it would create a separate airline 
 if the three companies pool their air-freight businesses their clout would be considerable 
 according to figures from the international air transport association they carried a combined N million tons of freight last year 
 federal express and flying tiger as separate companies carried a combined N million tons 
 air france and lufthansa last month concluded a far-reaching cooperation accord that includes air-freight activities 
 they plan to increase cooperation in freight <unk> and create a world-wide computer system to process cargo 
 other airlines would have access to the system they said and negotiations with partners were already under way 
 both european airlines operate extensive fleets of boeing N <unk> and N <unk> aircraft that carry both freight and passengers on the main deck 
 they currently have large orders for cargo planes 
 several airlines including lufthansa jal and cathay pacific airways are working on a so-called global cargo system and are trying to attract other carriers to join mr. daly said 
 jal also has signaled it is looking for <unk> in europe before the end of N 
 last month the carrier said it wanted to lease crews and planes from british airways so it could <unk> its passengers from london to other european <unk> 
 british airways said it has n't received a proposal from jal 
 but last week there were <unk> negotiations between the u.k. and japan a likely first step to any commercial agreement between jal and british airways or another u.k. carrier

 in a move to prevent any <unk> in the financial markets from the california earthquake the securities and exchange commission said it temporarily <unk> options listed on the pacific stock exchange to the american new york and philadelphia stock exchanges and to the chicago board options exchange 
 the decision which affects millions of dollars of trading positions was made late yesterday because the pacific exchange 's options floor was shut down as a result of tuesday 's earthquake 
 the sec faced with a major squeeze on options positions said it was necessary to ensure that options listed on the exchange could be traded today and tomorrow 
 sec chairman richard breeden said the cooperation by the exchanges would enable investors to buy and sell options listed solely on the pacific exchange <unk> the liquidity of the market 
 officials at the four exchanges said well over N traders from the pacific exchange were taking flights from san francisco late yesterday to the american new york and philadelphia exchanges and to the cboe where they would continue making markets in the <unk> options 
 the big board said <unk> quickly <unk> a new options floor to <unk> N traders from the pacific exchange 
 in addition specialists on the exchanges agreed to provide backup capital for <unk> in pacific exchange options traded on the exchanges 
 trading was light on the pacific stock exchange yesterday with workers at the exchange 's main floor in san francisco struggling to execute orders by <unk> as a result of a continuing power <unk> 
 the most pressing problem was the suspension of options trading 
 the pacific exchange has options for N underlying stock issues including highly active hilton hotels corp. which is listed on the big board 
 investors were concerned that they might be unable to exercise options that expire tomorrow 
 but professionals said throughout the day that the shutdown would n't be a cause for alarm even if it were to <unk> for several days 
 i 've told my staff and clients that they still have the ability to exercise their options because they are guaranteed by the options clearing corp. said michael schwartz a senior registered options strategist at oppenheimer & co 
 the sec <unk> trading in the options however to allow investors to do more than simply exercise the options 
 while the exchange 's equities floor in san francisco remained open on a limited basis orders were being <unk> and executed in los angeles 
 workers could dial out but they could n't receive telephone calls 
 it 's a very uncertain situation right now said <unk> <unk> administrative assistant of trading floor operations of the exchange which has daily volume of about N million shares 
 because the exchange 's computer was <unk> orders to the exchange 's trading operations in los angeles business is as usual mr. <unk> said 
 if one city is down the other can take over 
 meanwhile the brokerage firms in san francisco were trying to cope 
 charles <unk> chairman and chief executive officer of <unk> & co. said traders came to work at N a.m. <unk> many on foot because of uncertain road and traffic conditions but learned that they would have to await a required inspection by the city in order to turn the power back on at the company 's two main facilities there 
 that should happen by today he said 
 traders worked with the help of <unk> <unk> through windows despite large cracks in the walls and a lack of <unk> phone calls 
 also most of the telecommunications equipment was out 
 the traders were executing municipal bond mutual fund and other orders through a sister firm tucker anthony inc. which is also owned by john hancock freedom securities but is based in new york 
 we are having a regular day 
 volume is down out of san francisco but not out of the N <unk> offices mr. <unk> added 
 <unk> 's oakland office executed orders through the sacramento office which was n't affected by the quake 
 others like prudential-bache securities inc. which has eight offices in the san francisco area set up an N number yesterday morning for customers to obtain market commentary and other help 
 at kidder peabody & co. 's sacramento branch manager <unk> white received calls yesterday morning from workers in san francisco who offered to work in sacramento 
 then she discovered that quotron systems inc. 's sacramento lines were down because they are normally tied in through a system that goes through san francisco 
 so the kidder brokers had to call other company offices to get quotes on stocks 
 at quotron the company 's national <unk> center which swung into action for the first time last month for hurricane hugo assembled a tactical team at N a.m. yesterday to begin <unk> lines and restore service to brokers and traders 
 the company dispatched as many as N people in the san francisco area to do the work though most of the <unk> was done by computer 
 service appeared to be down throughout the financial district in downtown san francisco while just parts of oakland and san jose were knocked out 
 but dale irvine director of the emergency center said service was being restored to <unk> san francisco areas 
 in chicago yesterday options clearing confirmed that it guarantees the pacific exchange options 
 the firm also will permit its members and the public to exercise their put and call options contracts traded on the pacific exchange even if the exchange is closed said wayne <unk> chairman of options clearing 
 put options give holders the right but not the obligation to sell a financial instrument at a specified price while call options give holders the right but not the obligation to buy a financial instrument at a specified price 
 investors and traders in pacific exchange options are protected to the extent that they can convert their put and call options into the underlying instrument mr. <unk> said 
 we are seeing such exercises today in fact 
 international business machines corp. said its board approved the purchase of $ N billion of its common shares a move that should help support its battered stock 
 even as the stock market has generally done well this year ibm 's shares have slipped steadily from its 52-week high of $ N 
 yesterday 's closing price of $ N down N cents in composite trading on the new york stock exchange puts the stock at about N N times book value which is as low as it has <unk> over the past decade 
 the announcement came after the market 's close 
 the move by ibm was n't exactly a surprise 
 the company has spent some $ N billion over the past N N years to buy back N million common shares or roughly N N of those outstanding 
 in addition despite ibm 's <unk> recent problems the computer giant still generates enormous amounts of cash 
 as of the end of the second quarter it had $ N billion of cash and <unk> securities on hand 
 as a result some securities analysts had predicted in recent days that ibm would <unk> additional purchases 
 in armonk n.y. a spokesman said that although ibm did n't view its spending as necessarily a way to support the stock it thought the purchases were a good way to improve such financial measurements as per-share earnings and return on equity 
 we view it as a good long-term investment the spokesman said 
 in the short term the move is likely to have little effect 
 at yesterday 's closing price $ N billion would buy back about N million shares or less than N N of the roughly N million outstanding 
 in addition as of sept. N the company still had authorization to buy $ N million of stock under a prior repurchase program 
 over the long term however ibm 's stock <unk> along with its hefty $ <unk> annual dividend and generally loyal following among large institutional investors are providing a floor for the stock price 
 although ibm last year produced its first strong results in four years and was expected to continue to roll this year it began <unk> as early as january 
 first it had trouble manufacturing a chip for its mainframes ibm 's bread-and-butter business 
 then it had a series of smaller <unk> including problems manufacturing certain personal computers and the delay in the announcement of some important workstations 
 finally ibm had to delay the introduction of some high-end disk drives which account for N N of its $ N billion of annual revenue 
 none of the problems is necessarily fatal and they are n't all necessarily even related 
 there are also other factors at work that are outside ibm 's control such as currency exchange rates 
 the strong dollar which reduces the value of overseas earnings and revenue when they are translated into dollars is expected to knock N to N cents off ibm 's per-share earnings for the full year 
 without that problem ibm might have matched last year 's earnings of $ N billion or $ N a share 
 still investors will take some convincing before they get back into ibm 's stock in a big way 
 steve <unk> a securities analyst at first boston said that while investors were looking for an excuse to buy ibm shares a year ago even the big institutional investors are looking for a reason to avoid the stock these days 
 on wall street yesterday northern california 's killer earthquake was just another chance to make a buck 
 at the opening bell investors quickly began <unk> out shares of companies expected to profit or suffer in some way from the california disaster including insurers <unk> companies refiners and housing lenders 
 brokerage houses jumped in touting <unk> demand stocks and kidder peabody & co. set up a <unk> hot line for san <unk> who might need emergency investment advice and help in <unk> funds 
 wall street thinks of everything in terms of money says tom <unk> a senior oppenheimer & co. trader 
 however he added such <unk> trading moves typically last only a few hours and are often made without full information 
 the most popular plays of the day were insurance companies such as general <unk> corp. which rose $ N to $ N <unk> <unk> corp. up $ N to $ N american international group inc. up $ N to $ N and cigna corp. up N cents to $ N 
 yesterday the brokerage firm <unk> & co. said insurers will use the earthquake as an excuse to raise insurance rates ending their long price wars 
 before this bullish theory surfaced some insurance stocks initially fell indicating that investors thought the quake might cost insurers a lot of money 
 in fact fireman 's fund corp. which ended the day off N cents to $ N said earthquake damage would slightly hurt fourth-quarter profit 
 on the prospect for rebuilding northern california investors bid up <unk> <unk> co. up $ N to $ N and lone star industries inc. up $ N to $ N 
 bridge and road builders had a field day including <unk> corp. up $ N to $ N guy f. <unk> co. up N to $ N and morrison <unk> corp. which reported higher third-quarter earnings yesterday up $ N to $ N 
 fluor corp. a construction engineering firm gained N cents to $ N 
 but <unk> stocks were a mixed bag 
 <unk> stocks got a big boost 
 georgia pacific corp. up $ N to $ N and <unk> inc. up $ N to $ N both reported strong profits 
 merrill lynch & co. touted georgia-pacific louisiana pacific corp. and <unk> industries inc. as the best <unk> <unk> plays 
 other gainers were companies with one or more <unk> california refineries 
 <unk> corp. jumped $ N to $ N and chevron corp. despite a temporary pipeline shutdown rose $ N to $ N 
 meanwhile shares of some big housing lenders got hit on the likelihood that the lenders ' collateral people 's homes suffered physical damage and perhaps a loss in value 
 wells fargo & co. fell N cents to $ N and bankamerica corp. fell N cents to $ N 
 some california thrift stocks also fell including golden west financial corp. and h.f. ahmanson & co. which reported lower earnings yesterday 
 property values did n't go up in california yesterday says one money manager 
 pacific gas & electric co. fell N cents to $ N

 friday 's stock market plunge claimed its second victim among the scores of futures and options trading firms here 
 petco options an options trading firm owned by the family of the <unk> former chicago board of trade chairman ralph peters is getting out of the trade clearing or processing and <unk> business after <unk> a <unk> dollar loss friday options industry officials said 
 nearly N options traders on the chicago board options exchange who cleared trades through petco including a handful of traders who lost between $ N to $ N million themselves as a result of friday 's debacle are trying to transfer their business to other clearing firms cboe members said 
 timothy vincent petco chief executive officer confirmed that petco was <unk> from the clearing business 
 the owners of the company got a look at the potential risks in this business and after monday they felt they did n't want to be exposed any more he said 
 he added that petco remained in compliance with all industry capital requirements during the market 's rapid plunge friday and monday 's rebound 
 a cboe spokeswoman declined comment on petco 
 over the weekend fossett corp. another options trading firm transferred the clearing accounts of about N traders to first options of chicago a unit of continental bank corp. because it could n't meet regulatory capital requirements after friday 's market slide 
 the unprecedented transfer of accounts underscored the options industry 's desire not to have its credibility <unk> by potentially widespread trading defaults on monday 
 the cboe american stock exchange options clearing corp. and stephen fossett owner of fossett joined in putting up $ N million to guarantee the accounts at first options 
 the head of another small options clearing firm who asked not to be identified said that the heightened volatility in the financial markets in recent years makes it increasingly difficult for any but the largest financial trading firms to shoulder the risk inherent in the highly leveraged options and futures business 
 prior to the introduction of financial futures in the late 1970s most trading firms <unk> around the <unk> street financial district here were family operations handed down from one generation to the next 
 most also were relatively <unk> compared with the size of most wall street securities firms 
 mr. peters a <unk> street <unk> among the <unk> war ii generation of commodity traders was rumored to have <unk> a multimillion-dollar fortune from commodity trading and other activities by the time he died in may 
 part of a series 
 <unk> <unk> is a <unk> <unk> and <unk> in rural <unk> county n.j 
 but put her behind a shopping <unk> and she turns <unk> 
 if colgate <unk> offers a <unk> <unk> coupon she 'll cross crest off her shopping list without a second thought 
 never mind that her husband prefers crest 
 some weeks when her supermarket runs a <unk> promotion she boasts that she <unk> $ N off her bill 
 money is n't the only thing that makes her dump once favorite brands 
 after she heard about the <unk> hazards of <unk> oils in many <unk> she dropped <unk> farm and started buying brands free of such oils 
 i always thought <unk> farm was <unk> and high quality mrs. <unk> says 
 but i do n't want any of that oil for my <unk> 
 <unk> farm says it ca n't tell exactly how many customers it has lost but it hopes to remove the <unk> <unk> oil from all its products by year end 
 clearly people like mrs. <unk> are giving marketers fits 
 she represents a new breed of <unk> consumer who puts bargain prices nutritional and environmental concerns and other priorities ahead of old-fashioned brand loyalty 
 while brand loyalty is far from dead marketing experts say it has eroded during the 1980s 
 marketers themselves are partly to blame they 've increased spending for coupons and other short-term promotions at the expense of <unk> advertising 
 what 's more a flood of new products has given consumers a dizzying choice of brands many of which are virtually carbon copies of one other 
 marketers have brought this on themselves with their heavy use of promotions contends joe <unk> an executive vice president at the d'arcy <unk> benton & <unk> ad agency 
 without some real product improvements it 's going to be difficult to win that loyalty back 
 the wall street journal 's american way of buying survey this year found that most consumers switch brands for many of the products they use 
 for the survey peter d. hart research associates asked some N consumers including mrs. <unk> whether they usually buy one brand of a certain type of product or have no brand loyalty 
 more than half the users of N of the N products included in the survey said they 're brand <unk> 
 overall N N of consumers are n't brand loyal for any of the N product categories 
 about N N are loyal for one to five of the products 
 only N N are brand loyal in N to N of the categories and no one is loyal for more than N types of products 
 for such products as <unk> <unk> and athletic shoes <unk> to a single brand was quite low with fewer than N N saying they usually buy the same brand 
 only for cigarettes <unk> and <unk> did more than N N of users say they typically stick with the same brand 
 people tend to be most loyal to brands that have distinctive <unk> such as cigarettes and <unk> 
 <unk> <unk> a <unk> in the journal survey from <unk> wash. says her husband is <unk> about eating only hunt 's <unk> 
 he simply ca n't <unk> the taste of <unk> she says 
 the <unk> <unk> adds the only other thing i 'm really loyal to is my virginia <unk> cigarettes 
 coke and pepsi are all the same to me and i usually buy whichever brand of coffee happens to be on sale 
 brand <unk> plays a significant role in loyalty to such products as cigarettes <unk> and beer 
 people often stay with a particular brand because they want to be associated with the image its advertising <unk> whether that 's <unk> <unk> cigarettes or <unk> 's <unk> <unk> 
 loyalty <unk> most for <unk> products like trash bags and <unk> 
 only N N of <unk> users in the journal survey usually buy the same brand and just N N of battery buyers stick to one brand 
 underwear scored a <unk> N N in brand loyalty but consumer researchers say that 's actually quite high for such a mundane product 
 in the past you just wore fruit of the <unk> and did n't care says peter kim u.s. director of consumer behavior research for the j. walter thompson ad agency 
 the high score reflects the attempts to make underwear more of a fashion image business for both men and women 
 he believes there 's opportunity for a smart gasoline marketer to create a strong brand image and more consumer loyalty 
 what loyalty there is to gas brands he believes is a matter of <unk> at the most <unk> located service stations 
 brand loyalty was stronger among older consumers in the journal survey 
 nearly <unk> of participants age N and older claim brand loyalty for more than N of the N products in the survey only N N of those age N to N have such strong <unk> 
 <unk> people also tend to be more brand loyal these days the journal survey and other research studies indicate 
 marketers speculate that more affluent people tend to lead more pressured lives and do n't have time to research the products they buy for the highest quality and most reasonable price 
 an established brand name is insurance that at least the product will be of acceptable quality if not always the best value for the money 
 it 's sort of loyalty by default 
 meanwhile the bottom end of the market is becoming less loyal says laurel cutler vice chairman of the ad agency <unk> katz partners 
 they 're buying whatever 's cheaper 
 the biggest wild card in the brand loyalty game how those <unk> pursued but highly <unk> baby boomers will <unk> as they move into middle age 
 they grew up with more brand choices than any generation and have shown less <unk> so far 
 but now that they 're settling down and raising families might they also show more stability in their brand choices 
 mr. kim of j. walter thompson does n't think so 
 he believes baby boomers will continue to be selective in their brand <unk> 
 earlier generations were brand loyal across categories he says but boomers tend to be brand loyal in categories like running shoes and bottled water but less so in others like toilet paper and appliances 
 while not as brand loyal as in the past consumers today do n't buy products <unk> either 
 rather they tend to have a set of two or three <unk> 
 sometimes they 'll choose <unk> <unk> <unk> other times it will be <unk> 
 advertisers attribute this shared loyalty to the striking similarity among brands 
 if a more <unk> <unk> hits the market you can be sure a new and improved <unk> wo n't be far behind 
 the <unk> worldwide ad agency studied brand parity and found that consumers believe all brands are about the same in a number of categories particularly credit cards paper <unk> dry <unk> and <unk> chips 
 when there 's a clutter of brands consumers <unk> the <unk> by telling themselves all brands are the same so what difference does it make which i buy says karen <unk> a senior vice president at <unk> 
 too often advertising <unk> has n't done a good job of <unk> a special emotional bond between a brand and the consumer 
 but given such strong brand <unk> some marketers are putting renewed emphasis on image advertising 
 a small but growing number of companies are also trying to <unk> more <unk> brand loyalty through such <unk> <unk> <unk> as <unk> magazines and membership clubs for brand users 
 while discount promotions are essential for most brands some companies concede they went <unk> in shifting money from advertising to coupons refunds and other sales incentives 
 some people argue that strong brands can afford to stop advertising for a time because of the <unk> impact of hundreds of millions of dollars spent on advertising through the years 
 but most companies are too afraid to take that chance 
 and perhaps with good reason 
 says <unk> <unk> president of the d'arcy <unk> ad agency 's u.s. division every time N hours pass without any advertising reinforcement brand loyalty will <unk> ever so slightly even for a powerful brand like <unk> 
 consider for example what happened to maxwell house coffee 
 the kraft general foods brand stopped advertising for about a year in N and gave up several market share points and its leadership position in the coffee business 
 but since returning to advertising maxwell house has regained the lost share and is running neck and neck with archrival <unk> 
 now philip morris kraft general foods ' parent company is committed to the coffee business and to increased advertising for maxwell house says dick mayer president of the general foods usa division 
 even though brand loyalty is rather strong for coffee we need advertising to maintain and strengthen it 
 campbell soup co. for one has concluded that it makes good sense to focus more on its most loyal customers than on people who buy competitive brands 
 the probability of converting a <unk> to your brand is about three in N says tony adams the company 's vice president for marketing research 
 the best odds are with your core franchise 
 our heavy users consume two to three cans of soup a week and we 'd like to increase that 
 so campbell is talking to its brand enthusiasts probing their psychological <unk> to its soup 
 in one consumer focus group a fan declared that campbell 's soup is like getting a <unk> from a friend 
 that helped persuade the company to introduce a new advertising <unk> a warm <unk> from campbell 's 
 insurers face the prospect of paying out billions of dollars for damages caused by this week 's california earthquake 
 getting a grip on the extent of the damages is proving a far more difficult task than what insurers faced after hurricane hugo <unk> through the caribbean and the carolinas last month 
 the earthquake 's toll including possible deep structural damage goes far beyond the more easily observed damage from a hurricane says george <unk> a vice president in aetna life & casualty insurance co. 's claims division 
 but investors are betting that the financial and psychological impact of the earthquake coming so soon after the hurricane will help stem more than two years of intense <unk> wars among business insurers 
 reflecting that logic <unk> stocks posted strong gains 
 aetna and other insurers are hiring engineers and architects to help them assess structural damage 
 most insurers already have <unk> their catastrophe teams to begin processing claims from their policyholders in northern california 
 since commercial air travel is interrupted aetna based in hartford conn. chartered three planes to fly claims adjusters into sacramento and then planned for them to drive to the bay area 
 about N adjusters were dispatched yesterday afternoon along with laptop computers cellular phones and blank checks 
 some adjusters already in other parts of california drove to the disaster area with recreational vehicles and mobile homes that could be used as <unk> <unk> centers 
 insurers will be advertising N numbers probably on the radio that policyholders can call to get assistance on how to submit claims 
 state farm mutual automobile insurance co. the largest home and auto insurer in california believes the losses from the earthquake could be somewhat less than the $ N million in damages it expects to pay out for claims resulting from hurricane hugo 
 state farm based in <unk> ind. is also the largest writer of <unk> earthquake insurance in california 
 earthquake insurance is sold as a separate policy or a specific endorsement rider on a <unk> 's policy in california because of the area 's <unk> to earthquakes 
 state farm said about N N of its policyholders in california have also purchased earthquake insurance 
 <unk> insurance co. a unit of sears roebuck & co. said about N N of its personal property policyholders about N N in the san <unk> area also have earthquake coverage 
 the association of california insurance companies estimated damage to residential property could total $ N million but only $ N million to $ N million is insured it said 
 officials from the american insurance association 's <unk> service division which <unk> the efforts of the claims adjusters in an area after a natural disaster will be flying to san francisco today 
 they expect to have a preliminary estimate of the damages in a day or two 
 roads and bridges in the bay area appear to have suffered some of the most costly damage 
 highways such as the section of interstate N that collapsed in oakland generally do n't have insurance coverage 
 industry officials say the bay bridge unlike some bridges has no earthquake coverage either so the cost of <unk> it probably would have to be paid out of state general operating funds 
 however the bridge which charges a $ N toll each way does have loss of income insurance to replace lost revenue if the operation of the bridge is interrupted for more than seven days 
 that coverage is provided by a syndicate of insurance companies including fireman 's fund corp. based in <unk> calif. and cigna corp. based in philadelphia 
 earthquake-related claims are n't expected to cause significant financial problems for the insurance industry as a whole 
 instead even with the liabilities of two natural disasters in recent weeks analysts said the total capital of the industry is likely to be higher at year end than it was at midyear 
 indeed the earthquake could contribute to a turnaround in the insurance cycle in a couple of ways 
 for example insurers may seek to limit their future exposure to catastrophes by increasing the amount of reinsurance they buy 
 such increased demand for reinsurance along with the losses the <unk> will bear from these two disasters are likely to spur increases in reinsurance prices that will later be translated into an overall price rise 
 reinsurance is protection taken out by the insurance firms themselves 
 we are saying this is the breaking point this is the event that will change the psychology of the marketplace said william <unk> an analyst with <unk> & co. a hartford firm that specializes in the insurance industry 
 his firm along with some others issued new buy recommendations on insurer stocks yesterday 
 among the insurance stocks big gainers included american international group up $ N to $ N general <unk> corp. up $ N to $ N aetna up $ N to $ N and marsh & mclennan inc. up $ N to $ N 
 still a few individual companies most likely smaller ones could be <unk> 
 i think there is a <unk> good chance someone is going to hit the <unk> on this said oppenheimer & co. analyst <unk> <unk> 
 he suspects some insurers who had purchased reinsurance to limit their exposure to catastrophes will discover that reinsurance was used up by hurricane hugo 
 british west german <unk> and other overseas insurers are bracing for big claims from the san francisco earthquake disaster 
 although it 's unclear how much exposure the london market will face u.k. traditionally have a large reinsurance exposure to u.s. catastrophe coverage 
 jack <unk> chairman of fireman 's fund said this disaster will test the catastrophe reinsurance market causing these rates to soar 
 the catastrophe losses sustained by insurers this year will probably be the worst on an inflation-adjusted basis since N when another earthquake sparked the great san francisco fire 
 <unk> <unk> an insurance consultant in new york estimates that the N san francisco destruction on an inflation-adjusted basis included insured losses of $ N billion 
 he is estimating this week 's disaster will generate insured losses of $ N billion to $ N billion following about $ N billion in costs to insurers from hurricane hugo 
 silicon graphics inc. 's first-quarter profit rose sharply to $ N million or N cents a share from $ N million or six cents a share a year ago 
 the maker of computer workstations said a surge of government orders contributed to the increase 
 revenue rose N N to $ N million from $ N million the year earlier 
 in national over-the-counter trading the company closed yesterday at $ N a share down N cents 
 hunter environmental services inc. said it reached a preliminary accord on the sale of its environmental consulting and services business for about $ N million and assumption of related debt 
 the buyer was n't identified 
 the company said it also is making progress in negotiating the buy-out of its design division by management 
 in addition hunter said it will use proceeds from a private placement of $ N million of preferred shares to purchase an interest in a start-up company to underwrite environmental <unk> insurance 
 hunter wants to concentrate its resources on the insurance business and on a project to store hazardous <unk> in salt <unk> 
 jaguar plc 's chairman said he hopes to reach a friendly pact with general motors corp. within a month that may involve the british luxury-car maker 's producing a cheaper executive model 
 sir john <unk> told reporters at london 's <unk> yesterday he would be disappointed if we could n't do the deal within a month 
 he said the <unk> would mean jaguar could develop cars down range in price from where we are by offering access to gm 's <unk> parts production 
 besides creating joint manufacturing ventures the accord is expected to give gm about a N N stake that eventually would rise to about N N 
 jaguar figures a friendly alliance with gm will fend off unwelcome advances from ford motor co 
 but ford jaguar 's biggest shareholder since lifting its stake to N N this week is pressing harder for talks with sir john 
 we 're getting to the point where we are going to have to meet with him one ford official said yesterday 
 ford probably will renew its request for such a meeting soon he added 
 sir john has <unk> ford 's advances since the u.s. auto giant launched a surprise bid for as much as N N of jaguar last month 
 ford has signaled it might acquire a majority interest later 
 i 'm not obligated to sit down and talk to anybody the jaguar chairman asserted yesterday 
 he did n't rule out negotiations with ford however 
 the fiercely proud but financially strapped british company prefers to remain independent and publicly held despite ford 's promise of access to cash and technological know-how 
 sir john noted that gm a longtime jaguar supplier agrees we should remain an independent company 
 he said jaguar started negotiating with gm and several other car makers over a year ago but the rest dropped by the <unk> ever since the share price went above # N $ N a share 
 jaguar shares stood at N pence before ford 's initial announcement but the subsequent takeover frenzy has driven them up 
 the stock traded late yesterday on london 's stock exchange at N pence up N pence 
 developing an <unk> range would mark a major departure for britain 's leading luxury-car maker 
 a typical british executive car is mass produced and smaller than a luxury car 
 it generally <unk> no more than # N $ N roughly # N less than the <unk> <unk> which are all known for their <unk> leather work 
 we have designs for such executive cars but have never been able to develop them sir john said 
 gm 's help would make it possible for jaguar to build a wider range of cars 
 an executive model would significantly boost jaguar 's yearly output of N cars 
 you are talking about a couple hundred thousand a year said bob barber an <unk> analyst at u.k. brokerage james capel & co 
 a pact with gm may emerge in as little as two weeks according to sources close to the talks 
 the deal would require approval by a majority of jaguar shareholders 
 we have to make it attractive enough that holders would accept it sir john said 
 that may be difficult the jaguar chairman acknowledged when you have somebody else breathing down your neck 
 ford probably would try to kill the proposal by <unk> support from u.s. takeover-stock speculators and holding out the <unk> of a larger bid later said stephen reitman european auto analyst at london brokers <unk> phillips & drew 
 ford ca n't make a <unk> bid for jaguar until u.k. government restrictions expire 
 the anti-takeover measure prevents any outside investor from buying more than N N of jaguar shares without permission until dec. N N 
 but with its N N stake ford can <unk> a special jaguar shareholders ' meeting and urge them to drop the restrictions <unk> 
 it 's a very valuable weapon in their <unk> which could enable ford to bid sooner for jaguar observed mr. barber of james capel 
 otherwise jaguar may have to <unk> the two u.s. auto giants each owning a N N stake for more than a year 
 it would be difficult to see how a car company can be owned by a collective sir john said 
 it has never been done before but there 's always a first 
 although two baby bells showed strong growth in access lines usage and <unk> business revenue one reported a modest gain in third-quarter net while the other posted a small drop 
 <unk> corp. 's earnings increased N N after strong revenue gains were offset somewhat by refunds and rate reductions imposed by regulators in its midwest territory 
 bellsouth corp. 's third-quarter earnings dropped N N as a result of debt refinancing the recent acquisition of a cellular and <unk> property and rate reductions in its southeast territory

 total operating expenses increased N N to $ N billion from $ N billion 
 overall access minutes of use increased N N and toll messages jumped N N 
 bellsouth chairman and chief executive officer john l. <unk> said three factors accounted for the drop in third-quarter earnings 
 the refinancing of $ N million in long-term debt reduced net income by $ N million or five cents a share but in the long run will save more than $ N million in interest costs 
 the company previously said that the recent acquisition of mobile communications corp. of america would <unk> N earnings by about N N

 the wall street journal american way of buying survey consists of two separate <unk> nationwide polls conducted for the journal by peter d. hart research associates and the roper organization 
 the two surveys which asked different questions were conducted using national random probability samples 
 the poll conducted by peter d. hart research associates interviewed N adults age N and older from june N to june N N 
 the poll conducted by the roper organization interviewed N adults age N and older from july N to july N N 
 responses were weighted on the basis of age and <unk> to conform with u.s. census data 
 for each poll the odds are N out of N that if <unk> had sought to survey every household in the u.s. using the same <unk> the findings would differ from these poll results by no more than N N percentage points in either direction 
 the margin of error for <unk> for example married women with children at home would be larger 
 in addition in any survey there is always the chance that other factors such as question <unk> could introduce errors into the findings 
 program traders were buying and selling at full steam monday the first trading session after the stock market 's 190.58-point plunge friday 
 they accounted for a hefty N N of new york stock exchange volume monday the fourth busiest session ever 
 on friday N N of volume was in computer-guided program trades 
 in august by contrast program trading averaged N N of daily big board turnover 
 program traders were publicly <unk> following the <unk> crash oct. N N and a number of brokerage firms pulled back from using this strategy for a while 
 but as the outcry faded by the spring of N they resumed 
 some observers thought that after friday 's sharp drop the firms would rein in their program traders to avoid <unk> more controversy 
 but the statistics released yesterday show the firms did nothing of the sort 
 one reason they said was that the official reports on the N crash <unk> program trading as a cause 
 stock-index arbitrage is the most controversial form of program trading because it <unk> market moves if not actually causing them 
 in it traders buy or sell stocks and offset those positions in stock-index futures contracts to profit from fleeting price discrepancies 
 under the exchange 's <unk> program trading also describes a number of other strategies that in the opinion of some traders do n't cause big swings in the market 
 the big board 's disclosure of program trading activity on these two days was unusual 
 though it <unk> such data daily its monthly reports on program trading usually come out about three weeks after each month ends 
 the september figures are due to be released this week 
 the big board declined to name the wall street firms involved in the activity friday and monday or the type of strategies used 
 but traders on the exchange floor who can <unk> the computer-guided trading activity on monitor screens said most of the top program-trading firms were active both days 
 through august the top five program trading firms in volume were morgan stanley & co. kidder peabody & co. merrill lynch & co. painewebber group inc. and salomon brothers inc 
 though brokerage officials defended their use of program trading one sign of what an issue it remains was that few executives would comment on the record 
 besides <unk> the <unk> for program trading contained in the brady commission report they said stock-index arbitrage was actually needed monday to restore the markets ' <unk> 
 on friday the stock-index futures market was <unk> from the stock market when the chicago mercantile exchange halted trading in standard & poor 's N futures contract a circuit breaker procedure instituted after the N crash and implemented for the first time 
 futures trading resumed a half-hour later but the session ended shortly thereafter leaving the stock market set up for more sell programs traders said 
 by monday morning they said stock-index arbitrage sell programs helped <unk> the link between stocks and futures 
 but stunning volatility was produced in the process 
 the dow jones industrial average plunged a <unk> N points in the first N minutes of trading monday as stock-index arbitrage sell programs kicked in 
 at about N a.m. edt the market abruptly turned upward on stock-index arbitrage buy programs 
 by day 's end the dow industrials had rebounded N points or nearly half of friday 's drop 
 frederick 's of hollywood inc. los angeles said its board voted a N N increase in the specialty <unk> operator 's semiannual dividend to five cents a common share 
 the dividend is payable dec. N to stock of record nov. N 
 valley national corp. reported a third-quarter net loss of $ N million or $ N a share and suspended its quarterly dividend because of potential losses on its arizona real estate holdings 
 the <unk> holding company for arizona 's largest bank said it added $ N million to its allowance for losses on loans and for real estate owned 
 the company earned $ N million or N cents a share a year earlier 
 for the nine months valley national posted a net loss of $ N million or $ N a share 
 it had profit of $ N million or $ N a share in the N period 
 valley national had been paying a quarterly dividend of N cents a share 
 the arizona real estate market continues to be depressed and there is still uncertainty as to when values will recover james p. simmons chairman said 
 the decision to increase the loan-loss reserve and suspend the dividend is both prudent and in the best long-term interest of the shareholders he said 
 valley national said it made the decision on the basis of an overall assessment of the marketplace and the condition of its loan portfolio and after reviewing it with federal regulators 
 the addition to reserves comes on top of a provision of $ N million that was announced in june 
 in july moody 's downgraded $ N million of the company 's debt saying the bank holding company had n't taken adequate write-offs against potential losses on real estate loans despite its second-quarter write-down 
 richard m. <unk> valley national 's executive vice president said then that the company believed the write-downs were adequate and did n't plan to increase its reserves again 
 bruce <unk> a banking analyst with <unk> & co. a denver brokerage firm said valley national is n't out of the woods yet 
 the key will be whether arizona real estate turns around or at least <unk> he said 
 they 've stepped up to the plate to take the write-downs but when markets head down a company is always exposed to further negative surprises mr. <unk> said 
 valley national closed yesterday at $ N a share down $ N in national over-the-counter trading 
 two years of <unk> down the drain 
 that 's the way a lot of brokers feel today on the second anniversary of the N stock-market crash 
 ever since that fearful black monday they 've been <unk> wooing wary individual investors trying to convince them that oct. N N was a <unk> and that the stock market really is a safe place for average americans to put their <unk> dollars 
 and until last friday it seemed those efforts were starting to pay off 
 some of those folks were coming back says leslie quick jr. chairman of discount brokers quick & <unk> group inc 
 we had heard from people who had n't been active for a long time 
 then came the <unk> 190-point plunge in the dow jones industrial average and a new wave of stock-market volatility 
 all of a sudden it was back to square one 
 it 's going to set things back for a period because it <unk> the concern of volatility says jeffrey b. lane president of shearson lehman hutton inc 
 i think it will shake confidence one more time and a lot of this business is based on client confidence 
 brokers around the country say the reaction from individual investors this week has been almost <unk> 
 customers and potential customers are suddenly complaining about the stock market in the exact way they did in post-crash N 
 the kinds of questions you had before have <unk> says raymond a. chip mason chairman of regional brokerage firm legg mason inc. baltimore 
 i can just tell the questions are right back where they were what 's going on ca n't anything be done about program trading does n't the exchange understand where is the sec on this 
 mr. mason says he 's convinced the public still wants to invest in common stocks even though they believe the deck is <unk> against them 
 but these wide swings scare them to death 
 all of this is bad news for the big brokerage firms such as shearson and merrill lynch & co. that have big retail or <unk> businesses 
 after expanding rapidly during the <unk> years up to the N crash retail brokerage operations these days are getting barely enough business to pay the overhead 
 true the amount of money investors are willing to <unk> to their brokers has been growing lately 
 but those dollars have been going into such safe products as money market funds which do n't generate much in the way of commissions for the brokerage firms 
 at discount brokerage charles schwab & co. such <unk> investments recently accounted for a record $ N billion of the firm 's $ N billion of client 's assets 
 the brokers ' hope has been that they could soon <unk> investors into shifting some of their <unk> into the stock market 
 and before last friday they were actually making modest progress 
 a slightly higher percentage of new york stock exchange volume has been attributed to retail investors in recent months compared with post-crash N according to securities industry association data 
 in N an average N N of big board volume was retail business with the monthly level never more than N N 
 the retail participation dropped to an average N N in N and <unk> to barely N N some months during the year 
 yet in N retail participation has been more than N N in every month and was N N in august the latest month for which figures are available 
 jeffrey <unk> the <unk> 's research director says that all of his group 's <unk> statistics could be <unk> by as much as five percentage points because corporate <unk> are sometimes <unk> included in big board data 
 but there did seem to be a retail activity pickup 
 but friday did n't help things says mr. <unk> 
 with the gyrations of recent days says hugo <unk> senior vice president at charles schwab many small investors are absolutely convinced that they should n't play in the stock market 
 joseph <unk> president of retail sales and marketing at painewebber group inc. still thinks that individual investors will eventually go back into the stock market 
 investors will develop <unk> <unk> and their confidence will return he says 
 friday 's plunge he is telling painewebber brokers was nothing more than a tremendous reaction to leveraged buy-out stocks 
 meanwhile painewebber remains among the leaders in efforts to simply persuade investors to keep giving wall street their money 
 it 's more of an important issue to keep control of those assets rather than push the investor to move into specific products such as equities mr. <unk> says 
 the equity decision will come when the client is ready and when there 's a <unk> of confidence 
 it could be a long wait say some industry observers 
 some investors will <unk> back in says richard ross a market research director for <unk> & <unk> in chicago 
 then there 'll be another swing 
 given enough of these this will drive everyone out except the most <unk> he adds 
 mr. ross who has been studying retail investors ' perception of risks in the brokerage industry said a market plunge like friday 's <unk> investors ' confidence in their ability to make any judgments on the market 
 the long-term outlook for the retail brokerage business is <unk> mr. ross declares

 senate republicans have settled on a proposal that would cut the capital-gains tax for individuals and corporations 
 at the same time a small group of senate democrats are working on a similar plan and may introduce it soon 
 sen. bob packwood r. ore. the lead sponsor of the gop proposal said he intends to unveil the plan today and to offer it as an amendment to whatever legislation comes along particularly this month 's bill to raise the federal borrowing limit 
 he gave <unk> odds that a capital-gains tax cut of some sort would be approved this year though it probably wo n't be included in the pending deficit-reduction bill 
 he added that he expects to talk to the democrats who also wanted to cut the gains tax about <unk> a joint proposal 
 for individuals the packwood plan would exclude from income N N of the gain from the sale of a capital asset held for more than one year 
 the exclusion would rise five percentage points for each year the asset was held until it reached a maximum of N N 
 the exclusion would apply to assets sold after oct. N N 
 as an alternative he said taxpayers could chose to reduce their gains by an inflation index 
 for corporations the top tax rate on the sale of assets held for more than three years would be cut to N N from the current top rate of N N 
 that rate would gradually decline to as little as N N for corporate assets held for N years 
 the packwood plan would also include a proposal designed by sen. william roth r. del. that would expand and alter the deduction for individual retirement accounts 
 the roth plan would create a new <unk> ira from which money could be withdrawn tax-free not only for retirement but also for the purchase of a first home and to pay education and medical expenses 
 current iras could be rolled over into the new iras but would be subject to tax 
 for their part the group of democrats are working on a plan that like the packwood proposal would grant larger <unk> to assets the longer they were held by individuals and companies 
 newly acquired assets would get a bigger break than those currently held 
 an extra exclusion would be given to <unk> stock in small and <unk> corporations just starting up 
 no one in the senate is considering the capital-gains plan passed by the house 
 that plan would provide a N N exclusion to assets sold over a N 1\/2-year period ending dec. N N 
 after then the house measure would boost the tax rate to N N and exclude from tax the gain attributable to inflation 
 senators are focusing on making a capital-gains <unk> permanent 
 separately chairman dan <unk> d. ill of the house ways and means committee said he did n't want the capital-gains tax cut or any other amendments attached to the pending bill raising the federal borrowing limit 
 the current debt limit expires oct. N 
 he also urged house and senate negotiators to rid the deficit-reduction bill of all provisions that increase the budget deficit including the house-passed capital-gains provision

 but this quake was n't the big one the <unk> of N that has been feared for so many years 
 despite the <unk> loss of more than N lives and damage estimated in the billions most businesses and their plants and offices in the bay area were n't greatly affected 
 the economic life of the region is expected to revive in a day or two although some transportation problems may last weeks or months 
 a main factor <unk> more widespread damage was the location of the quake 's epicenter N miles from the heart of the silicon valley and more than N miles from downtown san francisco and oakland 
 also the region 's insistence on strict building codes helped prevent wider damage 
 the tremendous energy of the quake was <unk> by the distance so that most parts of the valley and the major cities suffered largely cosmetic damage broken windows falling brick and <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> 
 of course the quake was the worst since the emergence of the computer era turned silicon valley into the nation 's capital of high technology 
 like other major american cities the san francisco oakland area owes its current prosperity more to its infrastructure of <unk> <unk> linking thousands of computer terminals and telephones than to its location <unk> one of the world 's great natural harbors 
 when the tremors struck the region 's largely <unk> high-tech fabric held up surprisingly well despite the devastation visible from the air 
 michael l. <unk> vice president for network technology at pacific bell telephone co. says nearly all the network 's computer switches which move thousands of calls a minute from one location to another changed to battery power when the city lost power 
 the battery <unk> have enough power for only three hours but that gave emergency crews time to turn on an emergency system that runs primarily on diesel fuel 
 of some N switches in pacific bell 's network only four went down 
 one of those was in <unk> calif. near the earthquake 's epicenter 
 few telephone lines snapped 
 that 's because the widely used <unk> cable has been installed underground with N extra feet of cable between <unk> points 
 the slack <unk> the pulling strain generated by an earthquake 
 nevertheless phone service was sporadic many computer terminals remained dark and by late yesterday a third of san francisco remained without power 
 business in the nation 's <unk> metropolitan region was nearly <unk> an estimated one million members of the work force stayed at home 
 the economic <unk> was as abrupt as the earthquake itself as virtually all businesses shut down 
 the $ <unk> bay area economy represents <unk> of the economy of the nation 's most <unk> state and accounts for N N to N N of the nation 's total output of goods and services according to the center for continuing study of the california economy in palo alto 
 in high-tech the bay area accounts for N N to N N of the u.s. <unk> industry 
 this has been a major disruption for the bay area economy says <unk> <unk> the chief economist at the california department of finance 
 obviously things are going to have to go on hold for many companies 
 the damage to the bay area 's roadways could cause significant economic <unk> 
 a quarter of a million people cross the bay bridge every day far more than the N that use the bay area rapid transit system bart which was working but was n't <unk> in the city 's financial district yesterday afternoon because electricity was shut off and the area was being <unk> for gas leaks 
 california state transportation officials interviewed by telephone say they nevertheless do n't expect serious problems for commerce in and out of the bay area 
 all major roadways except interstate N known as the nimitz freeway and the bay bridge were open by N p.m. yesterday 
 officials expect difficulty <unk> traffic through downtown san francisco 
 the earthquake caused many streets to buckle and crack making them <unk> 
 other roads were <unk> by collapsed buildings and damaged water and power lines an emergency relief spokesman says 
 san francisco mayor art agnos estimated the damage to his city alone at $ N billion 
 but many predicted that the commercial disruption would be short-lived 
 of the scores of companies contacted by this newspaper few reported any damage that they did n't expect to have <unk> within a day or two 
 it is possible of course that some of the most seriously damaged companies could n't be reached particularly in areas <unk> the epicenter 
 typical perhaps was the situation at new united motor manufacturing inc. the general motors <unk> joint-venture auto plant in <unk> about N miles south of oakland 
 ten of the plant 's workers were injured when the quake hit about a half-hour into the afternoon shift seven were <unk> 
 metal <unk> on the plant floor fell over and water <unk> <unk> a spokeswoman says 
 the plant was <unk> and workers sent home 
 but the plant was able to resume limited production of its toyota <unk> and <unk> <unk> by N a.m. yesterday and <unk> was only N N of the work force about twice normal 
 computer maker hewlett-packard co. based in palo alto says one of its buildings sustained severe damage when it was knocked off its foundation 
 other buildings had broken glass <unk> light <unk> and broken pipes a <unk> says estimating the cost of <unk> in the millions 
 most banks were closed but were expected to reopen today with few problems anticipated 
 at the federal reserve bank of san francisco vice president robert <unk> says operations were <unk> along as usual yesterday afternoon 
 when the quake hit we turned on our emergency <unk> and brought our computers up he says 
 the fed serves as a <unk> for banks taking checks from one bank and sending them to another an operation that it handled smoothly tuesday night after the quake 
 the volume we received from the banks was a lot lower than usual he says 
 a <unk> plan in which the los angeles fed would come to san francisco 's aid was n't needed he adds 
 most of the telephone problems in the immediate aftermath stemmed from <unk> 
 the telephone network simply could n't handle the large number of people seeking to make a call at the same time 
 the volume resulted in <unk> delays that were as short as N seconds and as long as five minutes 
 mr. <unk> puts traffic volume at N to N times normal 
 american telephone & telegraph co. mci communications inc. and united telecommunications ' u s <unk> unit were blocking phone calls into the bay area to alleviate <unk> 
 the companies block traffic much as highway <unk> are blocked when traffic backs up 
 william e. <unk> pacific bell 's vice president of customer services for the bay area says most long-distance companies were blocking about N N of all calls 
 pacific telesis says its pacific bell unit also was blocking about N N of its calls locally 
 ironically the long-term effect of the earthquake may be to bolster the bay area 's economic fortunes and indeed the nation 's gross national product 
 it may also lead to new <unk> in major construction projects such as <unk> highways 
 it would in the near-term give a boost to the san francisco economy because there will be an influx of people to help says beth burnham <unk> a regional economist at <unk> hill a lexington mass. forecasting firm 
 the construction industry is sure to feel increased demand 
 there will be a big influx of federal dollars and gains in state federal and local employment ms. <unk> says 
 adds <unk> <unk> an economist at georgia state university there 's nothing positive about an earthquake but it will probably generate more construction activity 
 wall street reacted swiftly yesterday to the disaster by bidding up stocks of construction and related companies 
 shares of lone star industries inc. a cement maker rose sharply in anticipation of <unk> demand 
 in greenwich conn. lone star spokesman michael london says obviously with an earthquake of this size there are likely to be construction projects that would n't otherwise have been anticipated 
 but any increase is n't likely to be any kind of a surge 
 it 's something likely to be spread out over a long period of time 
 there will be a lot of repair work that wo n't require the quantities of cement or concrete that new <unk> would 
 lone star 's san francisco facilities were n't damaged in the quake 
 the earthquake is likely to reduce gnp <unk> in the near term and then could raise it a bit as rebuilding begins 
 the first effects are of course negative as work is disrupted and people lose income and cut spending 
 corporate profits may also dip initially 
 many of the lost tourism dollars wo n't be recovered many trips delayed never take place 
 subsequently however the ill effects are likely to be offset at least in economic terms as construction activity begins 
 because of the way the government keeps its books the damage to the bay bridge however costly wo n't be counted as a minus 
 the money spent on repairs will be counted as a plus 
 it 's very difficult to model the long-term impact of this says andrew goldberg who studies the <unk> and <unk> aspects of earthquakes at the center for strategic international studies in washington <unk> 
 you certainly can say it 's going to be extremely severe 
 we really are talking about <unk> down a major american city for a number of days maybe for a few weeks 
 mr. goldberg says the cost of the earthquake will definitely top $ N billion and could reach $ N billion 
 he <unk> that early damage estimates are often low the damage totals in hurricane hugo increased tenfold as more information was received 
 the earthquake damage of course would have been far greater if the epicenter had been in downtown san francisco 
 a direct hit on a major city mr. goldberg figures would cause $ N billion to $ N billion of damage 
 experts caution that it is far too soon for <unk> estimates of the quake 's total damage but it 's clear that insurers are likely to pay out enormous sums 
 jack <unk> the chairman of fireman 's fund corp. which is based in <unk> calif. estimates insured losses resulting the earthquake could total $ N billion 
 the impact on the insurance industry will be big and harsh but less than hurricane hugo says mr. <unk> who <unk> the bay area by car yesterday afternoon to get a sense of the company 's exposure to the earthquake 
 mr. <unk> says fireman 's fund will probably pay hundreds of millions in primary claims but after taxes and use of its reinsurance lines the company 's <unk> charge against earnings should n't top $ N million 
 the company was able to assess its damage liability quickly because it has computerized <unk> of northern california showing the exact locations of all the property it <unk> 
 fireman 's fund had claims adjusters on the streets of san francisco right after <unk> yesterday and was paying as many claims as it could right on the spot 
 fireman 's fund <unk> N homes and autos and N businesses in the bay area 
 in addition to paying for earthquake and fire damage the insurer must cover <unk> claims and also losses due to businesses being shut down by lack of power or phone service 
 but many californians may not have adequate insurance coverage to pay for damages to their property 
 the independent insurance agents of america says fewer than one of every five california homeowners has earthquake insurance 
 a somewhat higher percentage of people living in the bay area have bought the additional insurance protection but the great majority are n't covered 
 earthquake insurance typically runs $ N or more a year for a small house 
 whatever the long-term economic effect the scene from the helicopter above oakland is one of tragedy 
 <unk> sections of a <unk> freeway have been <unk> about like plastic building blocks 
 <unk> them sit cars and trucks abandoned in a <unk> scramble to safety the day before 
 in areas where the freeway made giant concrete <unk> of itself lie cars that police say have been <unk> into <unk> <unk> 
 on the <unk> rescue workers seem from the air to move in slow motion 
 they peck away at the N <unk> section of rubble searching for more of the N people thought to have died here 
 about N other deaths were also attributed to the earthquake 
 the heart of the earthquake N on the richter scale was N miles to the south near santa cruz but its terrible <unk> struck here on the nimitz freeway a major artery serving the bay bridge between oakland and san francisco 
 along the way the quake <unk> a mall in santa cruz knocked down buildings in san francisco 's fashionable marina district and sent a wall of bricks <unk> on <unk> in the city 's financial district 
 just a short span across the bay to the west the quake also showed its <unk> a <unk> area of the marina district lies <unk> under a steady stream of <unk> being pumped onto rubble to prevent it from <unk> <unk> 
 many of the buildings mostly <unk> and apartments were <unk> almost instantly as the underlying soil much of it landfill was literally turned to <unk> by the quake 's intensive shaking <unk> gas lines 
 <unk> say three persons died when one of the buildings exploded into a <unk> shortly after the quake struck 
 efforts to fight the <unk> were hampered because water <unk> were <unk> as well 
 from the air <unk> of yellow fire <unk> carry water from the bay to <unk> <unk> trained on the site

 dr. <unk> said searle is the only company i know that voluntarily will make consumer information available 
 according to federal officials and <unk> studies nearly half of the N billion <unk> filled each year are n't used properly meaning that money is wasted on some <unk> and patients are deprived of the benefits of medication

 bond prices <unk> yesterday as investors kept close watch on the stock market and worried about a wave of new supply 
 early yesterday bonds rose as investors rushed to buy treasury securities on the prospect that stocks would plummet in the aftermath of the massive california earthquake 
 for example some securities analysts warned that stocks of certain insurance companies which face massive damage claims would get hit hard 
 but when the dow jones industrial average rose instead bonds drifted lower 
 with stocks not a major focus we 're waiting for the next <unk> light said brian j. <unk> chief economist at midland <unk> securities inc 
 if the stock market tremors are behind us then the bond market will go back to looking at the next batch of economic numbers to determine where interest rates are heading

 the move had been widely expected 
 in the <unk> offering the company sold a portion of secured notes but <unk> all the unsecured notes 
 a continental spokeswoman said the notes may be offered at a later date 
 this was not a <unk> deal she said 
 i think this is a market that required some level of security 
 it did not make sense to offer unsecured paper in an <unk> market 
 investors have been <unk> for weeks about the market 's ability to place the $ N billion to $ N billion of new junk bonds scheduled to be sold by year end 
 supply troubles were also on the minds of treasury investors yesterday who worried about the flood of new government securities coming next week 
 we 're being <unk> by new treasury and agency debt offerings said william sullivan jr. director of money-market research at dean witter reynolds inc 
 the market is concerned about its ability to underwrite all this debt at current levels

 in the municipal market all eyes were on california debt as investors tried to gauge the financial <unk> of tuesday 's earthquake

 there are certain bonds traders refer to as earthquake bonds because the issuers are on top of the san andreas fault said <unk> <unk> editor of the california municipal bond <unk> a newsletter for investors 
 since those bonds already pay a slightly higher yield an extra premium for the earthquake risk they were n't <unk> affected

 the federal home loan mortgage corp. and federal national mortgage association two dominant issuers of mortgage securities have a sizable amount of california home loans in their <unk> pools 
 but their potential quake exposure is seen as small given that they require a financial cushion on all the loans they purchase 
 and because northern california home prices are so high loans from the region often are too large to be included in freddie mac and fannie mae pools

 the berlin wall still stands 
 but the man who built it has fallen 
 east germany yesterday removed erich honecker one of the <unk> <unk> against the reform <unk> through the communist world in an effort to win back the confidence of its increasingly <unk> citizens 
 but while it was a move that stunned the east bloc it hardly <unk> in an era of reform at least anytime soon 
 for the politburo replaced mr. honecker who had led east germany for N years and before that headed its security <unk> with a man cut of the same <unk> egon krenz the most recent <unk> chief and a longtime honecker <unk> 
 east germany it is clear is no poland where the communist party now shares power with the <unk> elected solidarity union 
 nor is it a hungary where yesterday the parliament approved constitutional changes meant to help turn the communist nation into a <unk> democracy 
 still any change in east germany has enormous implications for both east and west 
 it raises the <unk> hopes of many germans for reunification a prospect that almost equally <unk> political leaders in moscow washington and western europe 
 mr. krenz N was named the new party chief just minutes after the party 's <unk> central committee <unk> in east berlin 
 although the east german news agency <unk> claimed mr. honecker had asked to be relieved of his duties for health reasons west german government sources said the <unk> politburo had asked for his resignation at a separate meeting late tuesday 
 mr. honecker was twice <unk> this summer for a <unk> <unk> <unk> and his physical condition has been the subject of intense speculation in the western media 
 <unk> said mr. honecker a hard-line <unk> who in N <unk> the construction of the berlin wall also was relieved of his title as head of state and his position as chief of the military 
 mr. krenz is expected to be formally named to all three positions once the nation 's parliament <unk> later this week 
 mr. honecker 's <unk> fall <unk> nearly two decades of <unk> leadership during which mr. honecker now N years old built east germany into the most economically advanced nation in the soviet bloc 
 his grip on power unraveled this summer as thousands of his <unk> <unk> by the <unk> of his rule fled to the west 
 thousands more have taken to the streets in the last month in east germany 's largest wave of domestic unrest since a workers ' <unk> in N 
 in washington the bush administration took a <unk> cautious and skeptical view of the leadership change 
 the official line was to offer <unk> ties to mr. krenz provided he is willing to institute reforms 
 but u.s. officials have strong doubts that he is a <unk> 
 president bush told reporters whether that the leadership change reflects a change in <unk> relations i do n't think so 
 because mr. krenz has been very much in accord with the policies of honecker 
 one top u.s. expert on east germany added there is no <unk> champion of reform that we know of in the east german leadership 
 indeed mr. krenz said on east german television last night that there will be no sharing of power with pro-democracy groups 
 he said while dialogue is important enough <unk> already exist in which different interests can express themselves 
 the removal of mr. honecker was apparently the result of bitter <unk> within the top ranks of the communist party 
 according to west german government sources mr. honecker and several senior politburo members fought over the last week to delay any decisions about a leadership change 
 but with public demonstrations in the country growing in size and intensity mr. honecker and several key allies lost out in this battle officials say 
 those allies included politburo members <unk> <unk> who has long headed economic affairs and <unk> <unk> chief of information policy 
 both men were also relieved of their duties yesterday 
 although other resignations may follow it 's still not clear to what extent the change in party personnel will alter the government 's resistance to fundamental change 
 clearly the central figure in this process is egon krenz 
 born in N in a <unk> sea town now part of poland he was eight years old when world war ii ended 
 like west german chancellor helmut kohl he represents the postwar generation that has grown up during germany 's division 
 since joining the politburo in N as its youngest member mr. krenz had acquired the <unk> crown prince a reference to the widely held view that he was the <unk> successor to mr. honecker 
 in fact the two men have had <unk> similar career <unk> both having served as chief of internal security before their rise to the top party position 
 moreover both men have <unk> to a similar hard-line philosophy 
 notably one of mr. krenz 's few official visits overseas came a few months ago when he visited china after the massacre in beijing 
 he later defended the chinese government 's response during a separate visit to west germany 
 east german <unk> in particular fears mr. krenz in part because of an incident in january N when he was believed to have ordered the arrest of hundreds of <unk> who had sought refuge in the church 
 however mr. krenz also has a reputation for being politically <unk> 
 his <unk> ability to read the shifting popular mood in east germany is best illustrated by his apparent break with his old <unk> mr. honecker 
 indeed according to west german government sources he was one of the leaders in the power struggle that <unk> mr. honecker 
 in recent days mr. krenz has sought to project a <unk> image 
 according to a report widely circulating in east berlin it was mr. krenz who ordered police to stop using excessive force against demonstrators in leipzig 
 he does n't want to have the image of the gun man says fred <unk> an expert at the <unk> institute of east european and international studies in <unk> 
 he 's not a <unk> he wants to have the image of a <unk> 
 as part of his image <unk> mr. krenz is expected to take modest steps toward reform to rebuild confidence among the people and <unk> the party 's authority 
 besides <unk> other senior politburo officials who allied themselves with mr. honecker mr. krenz could loosen controls on the news media free up travel restrictions and establish a dialogue with various dissident groups 
 but will it be enough 
 west german government officials and western analysts are doubtful 
 he does n't <unk> what people want so the unrest will go on mr. <unk> predicts 
 at the same time the expectations of the east german people are great and will continue to grow 
 says one west german official what 's necessary now is the process of <unk> 
 not just that people are being heard but that their interests are being taken seriously 
 chancellor kohl meanwhile has invited mr. krenz to open discussions with bonn on a wide range of subjects 
 reports in the west german press citing sources in east germany suggest mr. krenz may serve only as a bridge between mr. honecker and a genuine reform leader 
 adding to that speculation is mr. krenz 's reputation as a heavy <unk> who is said to also suffer from <unk> 
 this is a dynamic process and we 're experiencing the first step the bonn official adds 
 the selection of mr. krenz may also <unk> moscow 
 soviet leader mikhail gorbachev has pressed hard for a change in east germany 's rigid stance 
 two <unk> party leaders favored by moscow as possible <unk> to mr. honecker <unk> party secretary <unk> <unk> and politburo member <unk> <unk> were passed over 
 if mr. krenz <unk> to rigid policies the pressure from the soviet union could intensify 
 in moscow mr. gorbachev sent mr. krenz a <unk> <unk> that appeared to urge the new leadership to <unk> growing calls for change 
 according to the soviet news agency tass gorbachev expressed the conviction that the leadership of the socialist unity party of east germany being sensitive to the demands of the time will find solutions to complicated problems the <unk> german democratic republic encountered 
 a force of younger <unk> members in the east german bureaucracy has for some time been pushing for <unk> within their country 
 the older generation has been torn between a fear of <unk> with the status <unk> and a fear of what might happen if they did n't 
 from the perspective of east germany 's old guard reforms that <unk> of capitalism and western-style democracy could eliminate their country 's reason for being 
 unlike the other nations of the bloc east germany is a <unk> of the cold war 
 <unk> the differences still <unk> europe and the vast international <unk> that implies wo n't endanger the <unk> of a poland or a hungary 
 but it could ultimately lead to german reunification and the disappearance of east germany from the <unk> 
 which is what the old guard fears 
 i 'm sure they 'll <unk> a reform that will be a <unk> for the <unk> 's future as a separately <unk> state says michael simmons a british journalist whose book on east germany entitled the <unk> country was published this month 
 up to now that <unk> has <unk> of a dogged effort by former leader walter <unk> to establish the country 's international legitimacy followed by mr. honecker 's campaign to build the east bloc 's only successful <unk> economy into a consumer <unk> 
 neither man achieved <unk> 
 early in N mr. honecker and his team stopped paying thin <unk> to mr. gorbachev and joined with <unk> in rejecting any necessity for adjustments in their systems 
 the <unk> <unk> and <unk> in contrast declared their intentions to reform while doing nothing concrete about it 
 the east german media soon began <unk> mr. gorbachev 's <unk> only as <unk> <unk> and giving space to his opponents 
 by late N they were banning soviet publications 
 the country abandoned its former <unk> to socialist unity and took to insisting instead that each country in the bloc ought to travel its own road 
 mr. honecker spoke of generally valid objective laws of socialism and left no room for debate 
 with this year 's <unk> in china and the soviet union and the drive to democracy in poland and hungary the east german leadership grew still more defensive 
 politburo member <unk> <unk> confessed to a grave concern over <unk> democracy 
 under the <unk> that <unk> the renewal of socialism he said forces are at work that are <unk> to eliminate socialism 
 some loyal voices in and out of the east german communist party saw the nation 's unrest coming 
 the first signs were economic 
 despite heavily subsidized consumer industries east germans have for years watched the west pull <unk> out ahead 
 in N for the first time economic growth came to a dead stop 
 <unk> some economists began to blame central planning 
 some writers in theoretical <unk> even raised the notion of introducing democracy at least in the workplace 
 by summer an independent reform movement was saying out loud what it had only <unk> before 
 but they are <unk> <unk> 
 their proclaimed purpose is to <unk> east germany of its <unk> <unk> not to merge with the west 
 one of their <unk> has <unk> a new <unk> of creative socialism 
 meanwhile the man mr. krenz <unk> has left an <unk> mark on east german society 
 <unk> by the <unk> during world war ii for his political <unk> mr. honecker <unk> the postwar generation of committed communist leaders in eastern europe who took their <unk> from moscow 
 he was a socialist <unk> who felt <unk> by west germany 's enormous postwar prosperity and the bonn government 's <unk> refusal to recognize the legitimacy of his state 
 finally during his first and only state visit to bonn two years ago he won some measure of the recognition he had long sought 
 but ultimately he was <unk> by forces <unk> by his own <unk> mr. gorbachev

 as the citizens of san francisco and surrounding communities began assessing the damage from tuesday 's devastating earthquake nbc news began assessing the damage from what some said was a failure to provide comprehensive coverage in the earthquake 's initial moments

 while rival abc news <unk> the competition in live coverage of the event by sheer luck the network was broadcasting the world series from candlestick park when the quake struck nbc news was unable to get its signal out of san francisco for the first hour after the quake 
 i have to attribute the lackluster performance to a natural disaster said mr. <unk> 
 so before i start to be really critical of nbc i would like to know more about what happened 
 there were no complaints from affiliates of cbs inc. and cable news network a unit of turner broadcasting system inc 
 but that was not the case at nbc news which has been dogged with the image of not being aggressive on major breaking stories 
 last summer the affiliates bitterly complained to network executives about the poor coverage of the student <unk> in china 
 i was not pleased with the slow start and neither was nbc news said guy <unk> general manager of nbc affiliate wave in louisville <unk> 
 a spokesman for national broadcasting co. a unit of general electric co. said the network was looking into what happened 
 the stations said they were pleased with the extended coverage yesterday including a special <unk> edition of today 
 don <unk> director of news at nbc news said in an interview that we could n't get a signal out of san francisco 
 we were out of the box 
 it was horrible 
 the comment we 're hearing is that we were slow out of the box but beat everyone else in the stretch

 pinnacle west capital corp. said it suspended indefinitely its common stock dividend and reported a N N plunge in third-quarter net income 
 the announcement made after the close of trading caught analysts by surprise 
 the company closed at $ N a share down N cents in composite trading on the new york stock exchange 
 pinnacle west slashed its quarterly dividend to N cents per share from N cents in december saying at the time that it believed the new lower dividend was <unk> 
 a company spokesman said the decision to eliminate the dividend resulted from a quarterly <unk> and that circumstances had changed since the december announcement 
 he declined to elaborate 
 edward j. <unk> jr. an analyst at shearson lehman hutton inc. speculated that the sudden dividend elimination <unk> an expensive agreement with thrift regulators over the company 's insolvent merabank savings and loan unit 
 analysts have estimated that pinnacle west may have to <unk> between $ N million and $ N million into the merabank unit before turning the thrift over to federal regulators 
 the latest financial results at the troubled utility and thrift holding company based in phoenix ariz. reflect continuing problems at merabank and losses in real-estate venture-capital and <unk> operations 
 third-quarter net income slid to $ N million or six cents a share from $ N million or N cents a year earlier 
 utility operations the only company unit operating in the black in the latest period had a N N drop in profit to $ N million largely as a result of <unk> at the company 's huge palo <unk> nuclear facility and the cost of purchased replacement power 
 in other operations losses at merabank totaled $ N million in the latest quarter compared with a $ N million profit a year earlier 
 the latest quarter includes a $ N million addition to loan-loss reserves

 with airline deals in a tailspin legendary wall street trader michael steinhardt could have trouble <unk> out of usair group traders say 
 only a week ago when airline buy-out fever was already <unk> down mr. steinhardt was engaged in a <unk> with usair 
 he was threatening to take over the carrier after spending an estimated $ N million to build an N N usair stake for his investment clients 
 the would-be raider even hired an investment banker to give teeth to his takeover threat which was widely interpreted as an effort to flush out an acquirer for usair or for his own stake 
 in fighting usair mr. steinhardt was <unk> against another investor <unk> warren buffett who bought into usair to help fend off mr. steinhardt 
 mr. buffett 's firm <unk> <unk> holds a much bigger stake in the carrier than mr. steinhardt 's firm steinhardt partners 
 now in the wake of ual 's troubles in financing its buy-out the airline <unk> game has been <unk> 
 instead of hoping to sell his usair stake at analysts ' estimated buy-out price of $ N a share mr. steinhardt is stuck with roughly N million usair shares that cost him $ N on average but yesterday closed at N N up N in new york stock exchange composite trading 
 it does n't make sense to <unk> out at this price mr. steinhardt says though he has stopped his takeover talk and now <unk> usair managers ' operating skills 
 at the current price the usair holding represents N N of all the assets that mr. steinhardt manages 
 a week ago usair stock briefly soared above N after a report in usa today that mr. steinhardt might launch a hostile bid for the carrier though takeover speculators say they were skeptical 
 if usair is worth N as a takeover and the stock went to N the market was saying steinhardt 's presence was n't worth anything in terms of getting a deal done says a veteran takeover <unk> 
 traders say this all goes to show that even the <unk> money manager can get infected with crowd <unk> 
 in trying to <unk> usair mr. steinhardt abandoned his usual role as a passive investor and ran into <unk> 
 moreover unlike mr. buffett who often holds big stakes in companies for years mr. steinhardt has n't in the past done much long-term investing 
 mr. steinhardt who runs about $ N billion for steinhardt partners made his name as a <unk> trader moving in and out of stocks with <unk> <unk> himself and his investment clients 
 meanwhile his big losses for instance in N 's crash generally have been trading losses 
 so some see a special irony in the fact that mr. steinhardt the trader now is <unk> with a massive <unk> airline holding 
 analysts say usair stock might lose four or five points if the steinhardt stake was dumped all at once 
 as a result mr. steinhardt must <unk> himself to selling usair at a loss or to holding the shares as an old-fashioned investment 
 long-term investing that 's not steinhardt 's style <unk> an investor who once worked at steinhardt partners 
 he does n't usually risk that much unless he thinks he has an <unk> in the hole adds another steinhardt partners <unk> 
 in recent days traders say usair has been buying its own shares as part of a program to retire about eight million usair shares though the carrier wo n't discuss its buy-back program 
 if usair stepped up its share purchases that might be a way for mr. steinhardt to get out says timothy <unk> a merrill lynch analyst 
 but usair might not want to help mr. steinhardt he adds 
 in N usair chairman edwin <unk> <unk> when trans world airlines chairman carl icahn threatened to take over the carrier 
 mr. icahn a much more practiced raider than mr. steinhardt eventually sold a big usair stake at a tiny profit through bear stearns 
 mr. steinhardt also could take that route 
 he <unk> big trading commissions on wall street firms 
 however with airline stocks <unk> he might not get a very good price for his shares traders say 
 especially <unk> for mr. steinhardt say people close to him is that usair 's mr. <unk> wo n't even take his telephone calls 
 while usair is n't considered absolutely <unk> its defenses including the sale in august of a N N stake in the company to mr. buffett 's <unk> <unk> are pretty strong 
 usair 's deal with mr. buffett was n't exactly a <unk> example of shareholder democracy mr. steinhardt says 
 since last april the investor has made seven so-called <unk> filings in usair as he bought and sold the company 's stock 
 such disclosures of big holdings often are used by raiders to try to scare a company 's managers and to stir interest in the stock 
 but of course it would be highly unusual for an investment fund such as steinhardt partners to take over a company 
 usair and mr. buffett wo n't talk about mr. steinhardt at all 
 analysts say usair has great promise 
 by the second half of N usair stock could hit N says <unk> <unk> of shearson lehman hutton 
 she thinks traders should buy the stock if it <unk> to N 
 but meanwhile usair is expected to show losses or lackluster profit for several quarters as it tries to digest <unk> airlines which it acquired 
 moreover some investors think a recession or renewed <unk> wars will <unk> airline stocks in coming months 
 however mr. steinhardt says he 's comfortable holding usair as an investment 
 while he has bought and sold some usair shares in recent days he says that contrary to rumors he has n't tried to unload his holding 
 mr. steinhardt adds that he bought usair stock earlier this year as part of a fundamental investment in the airline group 
 in N mr. steinhardt says he made money trading in texas air amr and ual 
 overall his investments so far this year are showing gains of about N N he adds 
 does mr. steinhardt regret his <unk> into the <unk> game 
 people close to the investor say that was an experiment he is unlikely to repeat 
 i do n't think you 'll find i 'm making a radical change in my traditional investment style mr. steinhardt says 
 <unk> resources inc. said it called for redemption on nov. N its $ N million outstanding of N N convertible subordinated debentures due N 
 the debentures were issued in the face amount of $ N million on july N N the ashland ky. coal mining water transportation and construction company said 
 the company said the redemption is permitted because the price of <unk> 's stock has <unk> or exceeded $ N for N consecutive trading days a condition set in the terms of the debentures 
 debenture holders are expected to convert most of the debentures into common because the value of the stock received in a conversion would exceed the $ N redemption price 
 commodore international ltd. said it will report a loss for the first quarter ended sept. N because sales of personal computers for the home market remained weak in some major countries 
 that will mark the second consecutive quarterly loss for commodore and will raise additional questions about whether it can sustain the turnaround it had seemed to be engineering 
 commodore west <unk> pa. had said in august that it was consolidating manufacturing to cut costs and expected to be profitable in the fiscal first quarter 
 commodore said that its announcement is based on preliminary information and that the situation could look different by the time final results are announced early next month 
 in fact commodore 's fiscal fourth-quarter loss was $ N million narrower than commodore had expected a few weeks after the quarter closed 
 still even results approaching break-even would mark a sharp weakening compared with fiscal N first-quarter earnings of $ N million or N cents a share on sales of $ N million 
 reflecting concerns about commodore 's outlook its stock has plunged more than N N since may closing yesterday unchanged at $ N a share in composite trading on the new york stock exchange 
 the price can be expected to erode further because the loss estimate came after the market closed 
 commodore has seemed to be setting the stage recently for progress in the u.s. where its personal-computer sales have been so dismal for years that commodore is close to dropping off research firms ' market-share charts 
 commodore has assembled an experienced management team it has persuaded many more dealers to carry its products and it has <unk> a <unk> advertising campaign 
 but those represent long-term strategies that probably wo n't succeed quickly even if they turn out to be the right ones 
 in the meantime the strategies will increase expenses 
 commodore had been counting on its consumer business to stay sufficiently healthy to support its efforts in other areas mainly in getting schools and businesses to use its <unk> which has <unk> graphics yet has been slow to catch on because it is n't compatible with apple computer inc. or international business machines corp. hardware 
 but sales to consumers have become difficult during the past several months even in west germany which has been by far commodore 's strongest market 
 the commodore N and N mainly used for children 's educational software and games had surprised market researchers by continuing to produce strong sales even though other <unk> personal computers now operate several times as fast and have much more memory 
 commodore has said it expects sales to rebound but market researchers have said that sales of the <unk> products may finally be <unk> off

 dale lang who this week completed the acquisition of the publisher of ms. and sassy is <unk> about the challenge he is taking on 
 mr. lang admits that ms. is in dire <unk> and that sassy needs big promotional dollars to keep it alive 
 but the <unk> publisher has moved quickly and <unk> to deal with the magazines ' problems 
 last friday he told the staff of ms. that the magazine in january would begin publishing without advertising 
 mr. lang will do away with expensive circulation drives not to mention sales staff and attempt to publish the <unk> magazine supported by circulation revenue alone 
 any fool can publish a money-losing magazine 
 i want to publish one that succeeds said mr. lang 
 for ms. it 's time to publish for the reader not the advertiser 
 as for sassy which competes directly with news corp. 's <unk> magazine mr. lang says that in the next two years he will spend $ N million promoting and improving the magazine 
 though sassy has grown quickly since its debut in march N it has been the target of conservative lobbyists and <unk> advertisers who <unk> at its frank editorial matter on <unk> problems 
 mr. lang said the former australian owners of sassy were <unk> by the moral majority 
 their reaction was to do nothing and ride it out 
 he said sassy will keep its <unk> tone but added we will keep a close watch on the editorial content of the magazine 
 sassy already has recovered circulation has quickly passed the N mark and advertising pages have stabilized this year at more than N 
 what 's more mr. lang says he has what all publishers wish for a <unk> <unk> niche 
 <unk> is written more for mothers not their daughters said mr. lang 
 but sassy has a different spirit 
 it gets more mail in a month than mccall 's got in a year and it 's not from mothers 
 i feel about sassy like i did about working woman N years ago 
 mr. lang took on ms. and sassy with the acquisition of <unk> publications inc. by his newly formed lang communications 
 lang owns N N of <unk> while citicorp owns the rest through its citicorp venture capital partners 
 two weeks ago citicorp and mr. lang pumped $ N into <unk> just to keep the doors open 
 industry observers have <unk> mr. lang on what some call his <unk> handling of ms. but his track record in magazine publishing in general has gotten mixed reviews 
 besides ms. and sassy closely held lang communications includes success a magazine for entrepreneurs and small businesses and working woman and working mother two monthly magazines 
 working woman with circulation near one million and working mother with N circulation are legitimate magazine success stories 
 the magazine success however was for years lackluster and <unk> 
 only recently has it been <unk> <unk> and its editorial product improved 
 success is expected to gain at least because of the recent <unk> of rival venture another magazine for growing companies 
 working woman and working mother have operated as part of working <unk> 's group a <unk> joint venture between mr. lang and time warner inc 
 the joint venture is being <unk> with mccall 's magazine being sold last summer to the new york times co. 's magazine group for about $ N million and time warner agreeing to sell back its N N interest in working woman and working mother to mr. lang 
 executives at time inc magazine co. a subsidiary of time warner have said the joint venture with mr. lang was n't a good one 
 the venture formed in N was supposed to be time 's low-cost safe entry into women 's magazines 
 mr. lang surprised time soon after joining forces when he said he would negotiate rates <unk> with advertisers a practice common in broadcasting but considered <unk> by magazine publishers 
 in addition mccall 's put in a less than <unk> performance 
 until a recent comeback it saw steep losses in ad pages and circulation 
 time executives complained about the <unk> editorial quality and in the end one time executive who asked not to be identified said frankly mccall 's and the joint venture were an embarrassment 
 mr. lang feels that time 's priorities changed 
 their management changed right after the venture was formed and i do n't think they were comfortable getting into the competitive wars of women 's service magazines 
 today mr. lang believes his magazines will offer what many women 's magazines do n't 
 we write straight for women on their level he said 
 we do n't have passive readers 
 mr. lang points out that even success in part fits the company 's image since about N N of its <unk> is female 
 mr. lang has named carol <unk> N as group publisher of new york-based lang communications 
 she will oversee working woman working mother and success magazines and retain her post as publisher of working woman 
 the sale price of mccall 's twice what mr. lang originally paid for it will finance lang communications ' buy-back of time warner 's N N interest in working woman and working mother 
 mr. lang says he is n't <unk> new acquisitions at least for now 
 we would have to go outside to banks to get the money and i am not ready to do that he said 
 besides we have enough on our plate 
 there is plenty of work to be done on what we have

 could the collapse of <unk> have been prevented 
 that was the question structural engineers and california transportation officials were asking themselves yesterday as rescue workers began the <unk> task of trying to extract as many as N victims from beneath the concrete <unk> of the <unk> nimitz freeway in oakland that <unk> in during tuesday 's temblor 
 after <unk> the area california gov. george deukmejian late yesterday called for an inquiry into the freeway 's collapse blaming the disaster on <unk> construction the associated press reported 
 the impact of the destruction of this <unk> stretch of highway was <unk> measured in lost lives 
 but there are other long-term effects that raise serious questions about the ability of california 's infrastructure to withstand a major temblor 
 it could easily be two years before the <unk> artery that helps <unk> oakland with san francisco is reopened and the cost to build a new stretch of highway could soar to more than $ N million said charles j. o'connell deputy district director in los angeles of the california department of transportation <unk> caltrans 
 caltrans in sacramento said total damage from the collapsed highway is estimated at around $ N million 
 the aftershocks of the highway tragedy are <unk> in los angeles as well as local politicians spoke yesterday against plans to bring <unk> to los angeles freeways by N 
 caltrans plans to add a second deck for buses and car pools above the median of a <unk> stretch of the harbor freeway just south of los angeles near the <unk> <unk> 
 los angeles county supervisor kenneth hahn yesterday vowed to fight the introduction of <unk> in the area 
 caltrans abandoned <unk> in the early 1970s following the N <unk> earthquake that destroyed freeway sections just north of los angeles mr. o'connell explained 
 that temblor measured N on the richter scale tuesday 's was 
 so why even consider <unk> freeways now 
 we 've run out of places to build freeways in l.a. and the only place to go is up mr. o'connell said although he acknowledges there are many obstacles including cost 
 but as for safety he says <unk> freeways built today with the heavily reinforced concrete and <unk> columns required after the <unk> quake should withstand a <unk> temblor of N to N on the richter scale 
 reasons for the collapse of the nimitz freeway were <unk> yesterday 
 but most structural engineers attributed the destruction to improper reinforcement of the columns that supported the <unk> and the fact that the ground beneath the highway is largely landfill and can become unstable or <unk> in a major quake 
 the <unk> roadway designed in the <unk> and completed in N was supported by columns that apparently lacked the kind of steel reinforcement used in highways today 
 while the <unk> did have long metal bars running <unk> through them for reinforcement they apparently lacked an adequate number of metal ties that run <unk> through the column said leo parker a structural engineer in los angeles 
 caltrans today uses a <unk> of the design mr. parker describes with <unk> steel <unk> inside 
 but in the case of the nimitz freeway the lack of such support caused the core of the columns to <unk> and buckle under the weight of the second deck <unk> <unk> who were lined up in <unk> <unk> traffic on the lower deck nearly N feet below 
 officials of the state agency did n't have any immediate explanation why the reinforcement did n't hold up 
 caltrans reinforced the highway in N as part of a $ N million statewide project using steel <unk> to tie the <unk> of the freeway to the columns and prevent the structure from <unk> in a quake 
 caltrans spokesman jim <unk> in sacramento declined to identify the engineering firm that did the reinforcement work 
 liability in the bridge and road <unk> will <unk> around whether government took reasonable care to build and maintain the structures says john <unk> a <unk> wash. personal-injury attorney who specializes in highway design and maintenance cases 
 the firm brought in to strengthen the structure could be liable as well 
 the results of the quake certainly raise questions about whether reasonable care was taken mr. <unk> says 
 given the seismic history of the bay area it seems to me that a N earthquake is a foreseeable event 
 caltrans ' mr. <unk> defended the agency 's work on the nimitz freeway 
 the work was done properly he said 
 basically we had a severe earthquake of significant <unk> and it was just something the structure could n't withstand 
 ironically caltrans this year began working on a second round of seismic <unk> of freeways around the state this time <unk> freeway columns in steel <unk> to reinforce them 
 but only bridges supported with single rows of columns were top priority and the nimitz freeway supported by double rows was left out mr. <unk> explained 
 the reason is that the technology is such that we 're not able to <unk> <unk> structures he said

 the white house is making sure nobody will accuse it of taking this crisis <unk> 
 in the aftermath of the california earthquake president bush and his aides flew into a <unk> of earthquake-related activity yesterday morning 
 some of it was necessary to get federal help flowing to victims but some seemed designed mostly to project an image of a white house in action 
 mr. bush and his aides were accused of responding too slowly after the exxon <unk> oil tanker split open in alaskan waters and hurricane hugo struck the carolina coast and they clearly do n't want a repeat of those charges now 
 so the white house announced that mr. bush got his first earthquake briefing of the day at N a.m. from chief of staff john <unk> 
 by noon mr. bush had taken two phone calls from vice president dan quayle who was in california made a televised statement of concern signed a disaster <unk> received a written report from the federal emergency management agency and visited fema headquarters 
 mr. bush himself essentially acknowledged that he and his aides were trying to head off criticism 
 on his fema visit mr. bush said that he hoped there would be less <unk> about the emergency office 's performance this time adding that the agency took a hit for its reaction to hurricane hugo 
 the white house already is talking of mr. bush visiting the california earthquake site this weekend 
 he visited the hugo devastation but not until after local leaders urged him to do so

 the <unk> <unk> that <unk> the san francisco bay area rated a N on the richter scale did n't match the great earthquake of N rated at N 
 the difference of just N points on the scale designed by charles richter of <unk> in the 1930s means the older quake was N to N times stronger says lane johnson director of the university of california berkeley <unk> station 
 the ground <unk> along a <unk> stretch of the san andreas fault on tuesday mr. johnson added 
 in N the <unk> was N miles long and a couple feet wide 
 though the epicenter of tuesday 's temblor was located N miles north of the town of santa cruz and N miles south of san francisco its havoc <unk> up the coast in seemingly random fashion 
 but the greatest damage was visited on buildings and roadways <unk> upon landfill as were the marina district of san francisco and the bay bridge two areas of maximum devastation 
 landfill loose and unconsolidated earth may feel like rock but it <unk> like liquid when you shake it said douglas <unk> professor of <unk> at san francisco state university in a televised interview 
 it <unk> in a <unk> <unk> pattern 
 our quake behaved much like the mexico city earthquake where great damage was miles from the epicenter 
 mr. johnson of the berkeley <unk> station said landfill can be done if it 's properly <unk> 
 you can drive <unk> on it and build on it 
 he cited the example of san francisco 's financial district where many new glass towers survived almost <unk> 
 but the public policy issues raised by earthquake damage will be difficult to address mr. johnson predicted 
 the attention span of the public is short he said 
 we 've known for years and years we 've got lots of old <unk> <unk> brick and <unk> buildings 
 one old building the golden state bank building on front street had its yellow brick <unk> <unk> off by the shock of the quake leaving a wedge of its third floor open to the air while <unk> of dusty bricks tumbled to the street below narrowly missing <unk> <unk> and cars 
 reinforcing such old building stock mr. johnson said comes down to money 
 it 's a danger 
 we know it 's there 
 and sooner or later we have to do something about it 
 the urgency is heightened because this week 's earthquake while major and followed by hundreds of aftershocks did n't release enough <unk> energy tension along the <unk> to preclude more and bigger <unk> soon

 but now the soft-drink giant appears willing to take the risk 
 the name classic coke has tremendous value and they have n't <unk> that name before says <unk> <unk> publisher of the trade journal beverage digest 
 the coke spokesman said a caffeine-free classic should help increase volume of the original brand

 dow closed at $ N a share up N cents in new york stock exchange composite trading

 but that signal on full-year profit <unk> doubt on whether dow will improve on its year-ago fourth-quarter net of $ N a share or $ N million 
 dow would earn $ N a share for the year if it <unk> that year-ago fourth-quarter performance 
 dow officials were <unk> that the company would earn less than $ N a share this year even before they announced in july a plan to acquire N N of <unk> laboratories inc 
 that acquisition could further <unk> earnings per share this year the company spokeswoman said 
 dow has n't said exactly what impact the <unk> acquisition will have on N earnings 
 dow blamed the third-quarter earnings drop on several factors including softer prices for polyethylene and other basic chemicals a slower u.s. economy and a stronger dollar which made dow 's exports from the u.s. more expensive to overseas customers 
 another problem was a N N increase in operating costs at a time when revenue was rising by only N N

 whether or not great cases make <unk> as justice holmes asserted who can doubt that when great confirmation hearings turn on the <unk> 's response to these great cases they make bad judicial history 
 <unk> bronner 's battle for justice how the bork nomination shook america norton N pages $ N is a <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of these hearings done with <unk> <unk> but with a flawed legal philosophy 
 while the book <unk> justifies its <unk> the title itself is dubious 
 what shook america was not a battle for justice but for naked power in which an army of judicial activists rolled over a judge they had <unk> 
 in its basic structure and style the book is <unk> with <unk> character portrayal <unk> action and <unk> <unk> of the sort more likely to be encountered in a washington <unk> than in a constitutional history 
 mr. bronner seems to believe that the hearings could have gone either way 
 i doubt that 
 given democratic frustration with the reagan victories and court appointments the <unk> plans in place and mr. bork 's paper trail of vulnerable <unk> it was pretty clear that judge bork never stood much chance of being confirmed 
 as mr. bronner himself says the <unk> of raw meat was in the air 
 perhaps because they won mr. bork 's <unk> come through more <unk> than his defenders 
 ralph <unk> was the organizing <unk> <unk> a conglomerate of pressure groups into an <unk> attacking force 
 harvard 's laurence tribe was the constitutional heavy laying out legal strategies for the senators and witnesses to follow 
 but it was ted kennedy who scored most effectively with his <unk> portrayal of robert bork 's america the parade of <unk> <unk> that would follow <unk> he claimed from the positions mr. bork had taken over the space of two decades 
 sen. kennedy never mind his dubious credentials for the moral high ground <unk> <unk> 
 i add two others 
 republican sen. <unk> specter of pennsylvania engaged the <unk> in a <unk> contest aimed at showing that mr. bork was willing to stretch the constitution in one area free speech while remaining rigid in all the others 
 it achieved a good media play and enabled sen. specter and others to vote against mr. bork out of <unk> 
 further <unk> came from left legal <unk> ronald <unk> who in the new york review of books painted a picture of a constitutional <unk> <unk> reading his personal <unk> into the constitution particularly in the area of original intent 
 the charge of being outside the mainstream of legal thought <unk> undercut mr. bork 's <unk> standing leaving him bleeding on the platform 
 the nomination still might have been <unk> if a number of democratic <unk> in the south and southwest had broken party lines 
 but democratic sen. bennett johnson of louisiana reminded the little band that <unk> blacks and women could <unk> the margin to punish them in their next senate elections 
 <unk> <unk> with mainstream and <unk> to seal robert bork 's fate 
 the <unk> 
 mr. bork 's opponents chose the <unk> held it and kept it 
 yet with the smooth confirmation of anthony kennedy an N <unk> only slightly less supportive of judicial restraint than mr. bork the democrats may have won the battle but lost the war 
 another <unk> however was the <unk> message the bork hearings sent into the judicial culture from which the supreme court draws its talent 
 the word went forth to every law school that those with federal court ambitions must travel a safe constitutional <unk> with no paper trail and no <unk> to their <unk> or <unk> 
 unfortunately the author simply does n't supply the <unk> frame to sustain his <unk> <unk> 
 he has too readily <unk> the case for the activist law school culture 
 probing more deeply into the doctrine of judicial restraint he would have found a long history going back to the great decisions of justice holmes 
 he would discover it also in alexander <unk> a <unk> constitutional scholar mr. bork 's <unk> friend at yale whose influence on the judge goes well beyond mr. bronner 's reporting 
 still the long view of robert bork as constitutional <unk> must be a <unk> one 
 his strength lies in his <unk> doctrine which keeps the court clear of <unk> group pressures and leaves most decisions in a democracy to elected legislatures and executives 
 unfortunately mr. bork failed to <unk> between such pressures and the emergence of great issues critical to a society that must be settled <unk> if it is to <unk> 
 the question of <unk> schools in brown vs. board of education was such an issue 
 in our time abortion has become another best left to a line of supreme court decisions rather than to the chaos of N state legislatures 
 a <unk> and growing consensus of americans clearly wishes to apply the right to privacy in contraceptive matters decided in the <unk> case to abortion as well 
 one can understand mr. bork 's fear that the new right to privacy will become <unk> stretched though a supreme court composed of men and women with <unk> <unk> and a sense of limits should be able to manage it 
 what is certain is that if americans allow another happening like the <unk> bork confirmation circus it will be at their <unk>

 sotheby 's inc. the world 's biggest auction house is taking a huge wall <unk> risk on the outcome of the sale of art from the estate of john t. dorrance jr. the campbell soup co. heir 
 the financial services division has guaranteed the dorrance family that it will receive a minimum of $ N million for the collection regardless of what the bids for the art works total people close to the transaction say 
 the collection which includes two early <unk> a van <unk> a <unk> other paintings furniture and <unk> went on sale last night in the first of six auctions 
 what sotheby 's is doing closely resembles an underwriting by an investment bank 
 a corporation that wants to sell stock or bonds goes to a wall street firm which purchases the securities outright accepting the financial risk of finding buyers 
 if the investment bank can sell the securities at a higher price than it paid the issuer it makes a profit 
 at the initial sale last night for example the sale featuring the <unk> masters bids totaled $ N million 
 that was slightly above sotheby 's <unk> estimate of $ N million 
 normally sotheby 's would have earned N N of the total in commissions 
 instead people familiar with the transaction said the auction house opted to <unk> that percentage in order to obtain the collection and in exchange for taking a bigger chunk of proceeds exceeding $ N million 
 art dealers say that while auction houses occasionally guarantee the seller of a highly desirable work of art a minimum price a financial commitment of this size is unprecedented 
 <unk> d. brooks president of sotheby 's north america division <unk> denies it offered the dorrance <unk> a <unk> guarantee calling such reports inaccurate 
 buried in the glossy <unk> catalog for the sale however appears the statement sotheby 's has an interest in the property in this catalog 
 explains a sotheby 's spokeswoman the statement means exactly what it says 
 we have some level of financial interest in the collection 
 we do n't disclose <unk> 
 frank <unk> a lawyer for the dorrance estate with the philadelphia law firm of morgan lewis & <unk> declines to comment on the financial arrangements 
 sotheby 's made the $ N million guarantee to keep the dorrance collection away from its archrival auction house christie 's international plc christie 's has handled smaller sales for the dorrance family over the years 
 when christie 's officials asked why the firm was n't picked to sell the dorrance collection representatives of the dorrance family told us it was a question of financial considerations said michael <unk> christie 's head of <unk> and modern paintings 
 collectors who have made their money on wall street have become an increasingly important part of the art business and their money has helped fuel the art boom but recently it appears sotheby 's has been returning the <unk> 
 in november N sotheby 's essentially offered a wall <unk> bridge loan of about $ N million to australian businessman alan bond to enable him to purchase vincent van <unk> 's <unk> for $ N million 
 it was the highest bid in history for a work of art 
 but two weeks ago sotheby 's said that it has the painting under lock and key because the loan had not been fully repaid 
 sotheby 's is offering such deals because it 's an art sellers ' market at least where the best works are concerned says ralph <unk> an attorney and author of the book art law 
 there seems to be a lot of art for sale but there 's more competition 
 the competition gives the seller the ability to cut a better deal he says 
 the dorrance family will still receive a substantial portion of the auction proceeds above $ N million people familiar with the transaction said 
 but it 's likely that sotheby 's will take a higher than usual commission called an override on the amount exceeding the guarantee 
 sotheby 's has been aggressively promoting the dorrance sale 
 at a news conference last may announcing plans for the auction sotheby 's estimated its value in excess of $ N million 
 more recently sotheby 's has predicted the collection will fetch $ N million 
 that 's the highest estimate for a single collection in auction history 
 the decision to put the entire collection on the block stunned many since mr. dorrance had served as chairman of the philadelphia museum of art and it had been assumed many of the works would be donated to the institution 
 at last night 's sale N of N works that sold were purchased by <unk> international gallery the <unk> unit of aichi financial a japanese conglomerate that owns N N of christie 's 
 meanwhile sotheby 's guarantee is raising <unk> in the art world 
 the consumer has to throw out the idea that the auction house is a <unk> <unk> says new york art dealer david <unk> 
 while he adds that he has no problem with auction houses who sell works in which they have a financial interest it ought not to be hidden in some small print 
 in such situations he says the house is going to put the best light on things 
 for example an auction house 's comments on the condition of a work of art that is up for sale should be looked at with very open eyes he says 
 there 's more and more of this <unk> going on at every level says bruce miller president of art funding corp. an art lender 
 dealers and auction houses know if they do n't lay out a half a million for this another one will it 's that competitive 
 in january two small new york <unk> the <unk> <unk> gallery and <unk> fine arts <unk> a major art collection owned by the <unk> family away from rival <unk> bidders with an <unk> payment of about $ N million 
 a christie 's spokeswoman said that while the auction house sometimes <unk> its seller 's commission to attract art works it still gets a commission from the buyer christie 's wo n't offer financial guarantees because christie 's believes its primary role is as an auction house and therefore as an agent for buyer and seller not as a bank 
 egon krenz the man tapped yesterday to become east germany 's new leader faces the same task that has fallen to neighboring socialist colleagues <unk> a country in crisis 
 but unlike the other new leaders in the east bloc mr. krenz will face an immediate threat to his nation 's very existence german reunification 
 mr. krenz age N is known as an <unk> <unk> one likely to continue the method of running a country that the berlin wall made famous 
 even if he were to change his <unk> and become another milton <unk> however he would still stand a good chance of losing a country 
 mr. krenz almost certainly will be a younger version of erich honecker his rigid predecessor as dictator 
 mr. krenz has followed much the same career path as mr. honecker both spent years overseeing the <unk> deutsche <unk> the youth group that is the communist regime 's principal tool for <unk> young germans into socialist citizens 
 more recently mr. krenz has been in charge of east german security and is the youngest member of the ruling politburo 
 faced with another mr. honecker so many <unk> east germans are likely to <unk> that the two german peoples will get their reunification de <unk> on west german ground 
 but if east germany 's <unk> politburo does loosen up enough to permit mr. krenz to make serious efforts at reform he will face a challenge just as fundamental 
 abandoning socialism means abandoning the east german state 's reason for existence and with it the <unk> for its <unk> and its wall 
 in this scenario it 's hard to imagine that a pale <unk> of the federal republic could avoid being pulled into some kind of tie economic federal or stronger with west germany 
 mr. krenz may need a bit of time to consolidate his empire which would do a lot to promote reunification scenario one 
 <unk> in west germany have already <unk> the exodus by <unk> an <unk> placed by mr. honecker wanted one people 
 the west german <unk> in <unk> <unk> and warsaw are continuing to find refugees at their gates 
 of course east germany true to its tradition could tighten its borders yet further 
 two of the last gestures of the honecker regime were to close the border to czechoslovakia and install <unk> lights in some spots along the <unk> 
 but with world-wide opinion even apparently in moscow against east germany the country would have to turn itself into an <unk> to <unk> down further on refugees 
 there have been some reports that mr. krenz is moving to soften his reputation notably rumors that it was he who kept east germany 's state police off protesters ' backs at the country 's dismal <unk> anniversary <unk> earlier this month 
 but even if he effects a <unk> <unk> he will face a serious ideological crisis and reunification scenario two 
 the problem is one that east germany shares with other <unk> such as north korea but one it must shoulder alone in the east bloc 
 when poland moves to reform it can at least lean on its past however flawed and short-lived joseph <unk> 's <unk> republic it was a <unk> democracy 
 <unk> reformers can recall the <unk> <unk> of the same period in their country 
 even the soviet union has peter the great to <unk> should it choose to 
 but east germany is merely the land of truly existing socialism 
 beyond that it has to compete with west germany for a claim to the german identity 
 up to now the main weapon of the worker and peasant state has been the <unk> of socialism 
 with talk today of a second economic <unk> in west germany east germany no longer can content itself with being the economic star in a loser league 
 without moscow 's military and party behind it east germany runs the risk of <unk> 
 if it goes capitalist and increases trade with west germany it will convert itself <unk> into an economic <unk> of the federal republic 
 there 's a certain <unk> logic at work here it 's particularly appropriate and <unk> that the land that produced <unk> <unk> should prove socialism 's failure in an experiment that uses its own people as controls 
 there may be forces that would delay this scenario

 some analysts note that after last week 's stock market tailspin and tuesday 's california earthquake it 's hard to gauge where the central bank wants the key federal funds rate 
 they say that the earthquake by preventing many banks from operating at full capacity has given the fed an additional reason to keep liquidity at a high level 
 the fed did in fact execute $ N billion of <unk> customer repurchase agreements the third set of repurchase orders in three days

 crude prices <unk> upward in brisk trading on the assumption that heavy earthquake damage occurred to san francisco area refinery <unk> but the rise quickly <unk> when it became apparent that oil operations were n't severely curtailed 
 trading on little specific information market players overnight in tokyo began bidding up oil prices 
 the rally spread into european markets where traders were still betting that the earthquake disrupted the san francisco area 's large oil refining plants 
 by yesterday morning much of the world was still unable to reach san francisco by telephone 
 west texas intermediate was bid up more than N cents a barrel in many overseas markets 
 at the opening of the new york mercantile exchange west texas intermediate for november delivery shot up N cents a barrel to $ N still on the belief that the refineries were damaged 
 in the san francisco area roughly N barrels a day of crude about a third of all the refining capacity in california is processed daily according to industry data 
 for more than the past year even the rumor of a major west coast refinery shutdown has been enough to spark a futures rally because the gasoline market is so tight 
 but yesterday as the morning wore on some major west coast refinery operators including chevron corp. exxon corp. and the shell oil co. unit of royal <unk> group said their refineries were n't damaged and were continuing to operate normally 
 most said they shut down their petroleum pipeline operations as a <unk> but did n't see any immediate damage 
 gasoline terminals were also largely <unk> they said 
 it 's hard to imagine how the markets were <unk> given that nobody could get through to san francisco said one <unk> oil company executive 
 as the news spread that the refineries were intact crude prices plunged ending the day at $ N a barrel down N cents 
 gasoline for november delivery was off N cents a <unk> to N cents 
 heating oil finished at N cents down N cent 
 the market was basically acting on two <unk> forces said <unk> <unk> of shearson lehman hutton inc 
 one is the panic the earthquake in san francisco which is positive 
 but once that factor was eliminated traders took profits and focused on crude oil inventories mr. <unk> said 
 after the market closed tuesday the american petroleum institute had reported that crude stocks increased by N million barrels in the week ended friday which traders viewed as bearish 
 but some market players still think earthquake speculation could have more impact on the oil markets 
 the problem is that while on the surface everything is all right the question is said mr. <unk> was there any structural damage to the pipelines or anything else

 copper 
 futures prices eased on indications of improvement in the industry 's labor situation 
 the december contract declined N cents a pound to $ N 
 according to one analyst workers at the cananea copper mine in mexico which has n't been operating since it was declared bankrupt by the mexican government in late august are set to return to work 
 the analyst said it will take about two to three months before the mine begins to produce copper in significant quantities 
 he added that while there has n't been any official announcement as yet the highland valley mine strike in british columbia which has lasted more than three months is regarded as settled 
 another analyst said the cananea return to operation may not be as near as some expect 
 there are still negotiations taking place on whether there will be a loss of jobs which has been a critical issue all along he said 
 nevertheless the increasing likelihood that these two major supply disruptions will be resolved weighed on the market the analysts agreed 
 both of these mines are normally major suppliers of copper to japan which has been buying copper on the world market 
 the first analyst said that the japanese as well as the chinese bought copper earlier in the week in london but that this purchasing has since <unk> as the supply situation at least over the long term appears to have improved 
 the focus for some time has been on the copper supply and good demand has been taken for granted he said 
 now that the supply situation seems to be improving it would be best for traders to switch their concentration to the demand side 
 he noted the commerce department report yesterday that housing starts in september dropped N N from august to N million units on an annualized basis the lowest level in seven years 
 along with these factors other economic reports suggest a slowing of the economy which could mean reduced copper usage he said 
 sugar 
 futures prices extended tuesday 's gains 
 the march delivery ended with an advance of N cent a pound to N cents for a two-day gain of N cent 
 according to one dealer japan said it has only N tons of sugar remaining to be shipped to it this year by cuba under current commitments 
 the announcement was made because of reports tuesday that cuba would delay shipments to japan scheduled for later this year into early next year 
 the dealer said the quantity mentioned in the japanese announcement is so small that it 's <unk> 
 one analyst said he thought the market continued to be supported to some degree by a delay in the cuban sugar harvest caused by adverse weather 
 the dealer said india might be the real factor that is keeping futures prices firm 
 that country recently bought N tons of sugar and had been expected to seek a like quantity last week but did n't 
 it 's known they need the sugar and the expectation that they will come in is apparently giving the market its principal support the dealer said

 the drug which is still in the experimental phase has n't been approved yet by the food and drug <unk> and its long-term effects are unknown 
 but researchers say the drug called fk-506 could <unk> the <unk> field by reducing harmful side effects and by lowering rejection rates 
 rejection has been the major obstacle in the approximately N <unk> transplants performed world-wide each year 
 researchers began using the drug in february on patients who had received kidney <unk> heart and <unk> transplants 
 only two of N transplants have been rejected 
 the drug discovered in N is <unk> from soil <unk> found in japan 
 the pittsburgh patients are the first humans to be given the drug which is made by fujisawa pharmaceutical co 
 we 're shocked by it because it 's worked so fast said dr. thomas e. <unk> director of the university of pittsburgh <unk> program at a news conference here yesterday 
 we consider it a <unk> drug like one for aids said dr. john <unk> an <unk> at the university of pittsburgh 
 researchers say they believe fk-506 is N times more effective than the traditional <unk> drug <unk> made by swiss pharmaceutical giant <unk> ltd 
 they are also encouraged by the relatively mild side effects of fk-506 compared with <unk> which can cause <unk> failure <unk> <unk> and other problems 
 the side effects of <unk> have made the penalty for its success rather high dr. <unk> said 
 dr. <unk> said that fk-506 would not be available in the market for at least a year and that the fda approval process usually takes three years to five years 
 there are no firm plans to expand the experimental program beyond the university of pittsburgh whose hospital <unk> the most transplants in the world 
 researchers could n't estimate the cost of the drug when it reaches the market but they said fk-506 will enable patients to cut hospital stays by N N and reduce the number of blood tests used to monitor the <unk> of <unk> and other drugs among transplant recipients 
 dr. <unk> said the research has been largely financed by the national institute of health and by university funds and that fujisawa did n't give the hospital any grants 
 he said that the research team had no financial stake in the drug 
 we 've known for six months the effect of this drug and our advice to our people has been not to buy the company 's stock dr. <unk> said adding that <unk> from fk-506 would n't be ethical

 according to mr. laband <unk> for price controls occurs when income <unk> threatens to hit home 
 to be sure the threat has hit home down here 
 yet in mr. laband 's <unk> of free-market logic human greed and <unk> are the only permissible psychological reactions 
 allowing <unk> prices for <unk> would indeed <unk> the lines at stores as he contends 
 but not because resources are going to their most efficient use leaving scarce goods allocated to those buyers who place the highest value on them 
 rather lines would <unk> because at higher prices many victims could not afford <unk> such as food and medical supplies 
 it is <unk> to <unk> that a poor <unk> woman can not receive immediate relief for her family at fair prices because she does not have as much to protect as a rich family 
 moreover essential relief supplies such as ice must be distributed throughout the population because of potential health problems from <unk> food and possible <unk> of disease 
 such <unk> effects give the state a right to intervene in the marketplace and temporarily coordinate allocation of resources 
 fortunately <unk> and charities are not motivated by <unk> but by <unk> 
 why should they have to <unk> with <unk> rushing in to turn a quick profit 
 these <unk> <unk> would be <unk> to take advantage of the situation if they ever expect to face the people of south carolina again

 mr. laband gives us an idea why economists ' predictions are usually wrong 
 they set up absurd situations <unk> from reality and then try to reason from them 
 i 'm surprised he did n't advocate letting people <unk> since that behavior can also be <unk> in a disaster and every individual has an incentive to alter the distribution of income in his favor 
 price controls were so <unk> embraced by charleston because price <unk> in this situation is equivalent to <unk>

 they <unk> law-enforcement resources at a time they are most needed for protecting lives and property

 though the cubs ' championship season ended with the national league playoffs a revival of the organic theater 's production of <unk> <unk> a play in nine <unk> set in the <unk> field <unk> continues within <unk> distance of the <unk> 
 <unk> of a different sort also are being offered by our two major theater <unk> the goodman and steppenwolf 
 each is more <unk> than an unexpected <unk> baseball championship but both help explain why chicago remains a vital center of this country 's regional theater movement 
 the goodman is offering a <unk> version of <unk> 's the <unk> through nov. N 
 the original is a comedy about <unk> a man who sees <unk> and <unk> in everyone except himself 
 he is the <unk> friend of <unk> and the <unk> <unk> of <unk> 
 the play is filled with <unk> dishonesty and <unk> 
 <unk> years ago the <unk> richard wilbur <unk> this <unk> comedy merely by avoiding the <unk> sort of thing as he wrote in his introduction 
 otherwise the scene remained <unk> 's house in N 
 assuming modern audiences readily understand that <unk> 's social indictment covers their world as well as <unk> paris mr. wilbur concentrated his <unk> <unk> on <unk> the <unk> french <unk> into <unk> and theatrical english <unk> <unk> 
 the wilbur translation is remarkable well worth a read and even better seen in the theater if you ever have the opportunity 
 but if you happen to be coming to chicago in the next few weeks do n't fail to have a look at robert falls 's the <unk> at the goodman 
 if mr. wilbur 's translation is a <unk> ground lens through which we see the <unk> and corruption of <unk> paris mr. falls 's production is a mirror in which we see ourselves 
 mr. falls the goodman 's artistic director took a recent <unk> by neil bartlett and significantly adapted it 
 mr. bartlett had <unk> <unk> 's cast of characters to six and set them in the london media world of <unk> britain 
 mr. falls transfers the setting to hollywood and <unk> the characters into what passes for <unk> there agents producers actors writers and <unk> 
 it works 
 mr. bartlett managed to more or less maintain <unk> 's <unk> <unk> form N <unk> lines in <unk> <unk> 
 mr. falls kept the form but <unk> it with mr. bartlett 's further help 
 with a <unk> cast led by david <unk> as <unk> <unk> <unk> as <unk> and especially william brown as a <unk> who plays the hollywood game but harbors <unk> values and feelings the goodman production barrels through an <unk> hollywood party with <unk> and <unk> 
 if this version with its <unk> to steven <unk> <unk> and <unk> attracts younger audiences who might stay away from the classical version then messrs. bartlett and falls are justified in abandoning mr. wilbur

 back then mr. <unk> was not only the angry young british playwright but also the first to use <unk> and sentence <unk> and <unk> <unk> almost to the exclusion of what we previously understood to be theatrical dialogue 
 when the <unk> was first produced on this side of the atlantic actors and directors were <unk> 
 <unk> were lengthy nobody moved or <unk> 
 nobody <unk> <unk> and nobody in the audience was encouraged to <unk> 
 this kind of theater was new to us 
 also it was not a funny time over here what with the vietnam war the <unk> democratic convention assassinations and <unk> 
 but under jerry <unk> 's direction the current steppenwolf production scheduled to play through nov. N breaks through the flat and boring <unk> that the <unk> had become 
 led by a <unk> performance by alan wilder as max the father the play is at once an <unk> and <unk> <unk> of a family 's rage <unk> fear and <unk> 
 encouraged by mr. wilder 's <unk> <unk> embarrassed <unk> and <unk> <unk> the audience gets the joke and begins to <unk> before the end of the first act

 sam max 's brother has escaped the <unk> by working as a <unk> <unk> and never seeking a wife 
 teddy the <unk> of max 's sons has made the most dramatic escape by becoming a professor of philosophy at an american university 
 though it 's clearly max 's wife who held <unk> here until her death now none of the other male residents of this <unk> household can challenge max 
 the play concerns teddy 's <unk> with his wife of six years ruth 
 <unk> <unk> <unk> as teddy seems the only cast member unable to get beyond the <unk> approach to a <unk> character 
 as ruth <unk> harris a large and beautiful woman who may be our next <unk> <unk> begins almost immediately to <unk> each of the men 
 in the end teddy returns alone to america leaving ruth in max 's chair

 if we wanted to stage death of a salesman mr. sagan says <unk> <unk> would have to live in a ranch house because of the low ceiling 
 steppenwolf needs the extra seats even more than the fly space 
 it 's currently forced to turn away many potential subscribers beyond the N who can be <unk> in its present digs 
 for all the attention that chicago theater has received during the past decade not one new building has been devoted to it 
 mr. sagan a former publisher and real estate developer has put together an $ N million financial package that includes approximately $ N million of tax exempt bonds issued by the state of illinois the first time that a state has used its educational facilities authority to support construction of a theater and approximately $ N million in grants from the national <unk> for the arts the <unk> foundation and a few other deep pockets 
 the rest he is confident can be raised 
 his board members alone have pledged $ N and he is just beginning to massage local foundations and corporations 
 mr. sagan compares the importance of steppenwolf with <unk> <unk> 's mercury theater in the <unk> 
 but <unk> 's theater company turned out to have a brief one might say a <unk> existence

 many investors expected damage from the hurricane to be the catalyst for higher rates in the industry which has been depressed because of low rates arising from intense competition

 <unk> merieux 's bid for toronto-based connaught has run into problems with the canadian government which told merieux last week that it was n't convinced that the proposed acquisition would be of net benefit to canada 
 merieux officials are expected to meet with federal officials in <unk> today to discuss the decision 
 within minutes after the stock market closed friday i called sen. bill bradley of new jersey advised him that the dow jones industrial average had declined by N points late that afternoon and <unk> informed him that he and his fellow democrats were to blame 
 they had dealt a major setback that afternoon to president bush 's capital-gains tax cut proposal which had seemed in the bag after it passed the house <unk> earlier in the month 
 sen. bradley has it in his mind that such a tax cut would <unk> the tax reform he helped engineer in N 
 but he knows that as many as N of his fellow democrats are <unk> to vote for the cut popular among their constituents 
 as a result he took the lead in arguing that the cut should be blocked on procedural grounds 
 he helped persuade N of these senators to support him and majority leader george mitchell on these grounds 
 the budget reconciliation had to be dealt with by the oct. N deadline and these senate democrats refused to agree to allow a vote to <unk> capital gains to the budget bill knowing it would pass 
 denied a vote on substance the gop leadership in the senate on friday morning was confronted with a hard choice 
 it could throw in the towel and hope to win on capital gains late this month or it could follow the white house strategy to veto reconciliation unless capital gains was <unk> 
 the u.s. chamber of commerce has been in the <unk> in supporting the bush proposal 
 it endorsed the white house strategy <unk> it to be the <unk> way to victory 
 at noon friday a senior white house official advised richard <unk> the chamber 's chief economist that the white house would not agree to a budget reconciliation bill unless it had firm assurances that a vote on substance would be permitted in the senate 
 two hours later the first word emerged on capitol hill that the administration had agreed to reconciliation with no such assurances from senate democrats 
 mr. <unk> was shocked <unk> the office of richard darman director of the office of management and budget and the administration 's chief strategist on this issue 
 he left a message <unk> mr. darman of selling out 
 it was the senate republicans though who had edged away from the veto strategy 
 the stock market reacted as mr. <unk> did crumbling as it absorbed the news that mr. darman 's strategy had been abandoned 
 the stock market after all represents the collective expectations about the value of the future income stream of the nation 's capital stock discounted to present value 
 why should it be so surprising that a N N cut in the capital-gains tax would have such an enormous impact on the value of the nation 's capital stock 
 the total value of privately held assets is easily more than $ N trillion 
 the value traded on the exchanges is close to $ N trillion 
 if the tax on any gain to those assets was doubled would n't the value fall to the owners of the assets 
 is n't it reasonable to assume that the asset you own would be worth more if the government suddenly announced that if you sold it you would be able to keep N N more of its gain than you previously believed 
 indeed the stock market 's steady advance this year tracked with president bush 's success in advancing his capital-gains proposal 
 a N N cut in this year 's capital gains alone amounts to roughly $ N billion 
 we 're talking real money 
 when richard <unk> advised the financial press that the market crash was caused by the setback to capital gains he was generally ignored and mildly <unk> 
 instead the press corps readily accepted the notion that a <unk> in the takeover financing of united airlines instantly knocked N N off the value of the nation 's capital stock and caused <unk> around the world 
 mr. <unk> was pointing out an elephant <unk> through wall street while conventional wisdom had <unk> on the ual <unk> 
 why is this happening 
 for one thing quite a number of the leading spokesmen on wall street are not portfolio managers who understand that the value of assets is greatly affected by how government taxes those assets 
 they are economists and financial reporters who <unk> with the view that a capital-gains tax cut benefits the rich 
 yet they somehow think that wall street is <unk> to losing the tax cut that seemed so close friday morning and is now <unk> 
 the market rebound monday followed weekend assurances from mr. darman that the administration has other plans to win the cut which is alive and well 
 sen. bradley 's argument is that a capital-gains tax cut would be bad for the economy in the longer run 
 it would inevitably lead to an increase in marginal income-tax rates in N he thinks when the white house is forced to ask for higher taxes to meet budget targets 
 that is with capital gains cut the <unk> of the N accord will be gone and political realities will push up income-tax rates 
 the <unk> which he has heard is that if he and his fellow democrats are successful in killing the president 's proposal the revenue gap will open up <unk> in N because of the weakened economy 
 in this atmosphere there would be no serious consideration of tax increases 
 if sen. bradley would permit a vote on capital gains though it would pass christmas retail sales would be strong instead of <unk> by a falling stock market the N economy would be robust and the revenue gains at every level of government including new jersey 's would be surprisingly high 
 no tax increases would be necessary 
 the struggle over capital gains is the most important game in town 
 in washington and on wall street

 but the offering almost did n't happen 
 the tva in fact decided to proceed with the bond offering following an agreement last week with the financing bank which allows tva to keep borrowing short term from the bank for two years after it goes to the public market

 the beebes alleged that toxic <unk> from the carpets made them sick 
 as a result of their illness the beebes said they lost $ N million in wages and earnings 
 in addition they said that months of exposure to the chemicals has left them sensitive to a wide range of commonly used <unk> 
 the case had been closely watched because attorneys anticipate increasing litigation nationally over the so-called <unk> syndrome 
 plaintiffs ' lawyers say that buildings become sick when inadequate fresh air and poor <unk> systems lead <unk> to build up inside 
 anthony j. <unk> a lawyer for burlington said the company believes the beebes ' symptoms were not related to the carpeting 
 he said that ill effects from new carpets <unk> themselves immediately but that the beebes ' symptoms appeared months later 
 <unk> adams the beebes ' lawyer said the verdict would not discourage other plaintiffs from filing such suits 
 scientists are only beginning to understand what causes <unk> syndrome and much of that research was unavailable when the beebes filed the case she said 
 the beebes now believe that a prime <unk> for their injuries was <unk> from an <unk> used in the carpeting 
 but the beebes did n't come to that conclusion until time limits had <unk> for adding the <unk> maker as a defendant in the case ms. adams said 
 the beebes have not yet decided whether to appeal

 early in october six arab nations in the persian gulf <unk> up prices sharply 
 on oct. N led by saudi arabia the world 's largest exporter they <unk> oil shipments to the u.s. and to the netherlands israel 's <unk> european ally 
 the timing was perfect 
 the arabs had tried <unk> before 
 in N when britain france and israel <unk> egypt to seize the suez <unk> arab producers cut off supplies to europe 
 texas simply pumped harder 
 u.s. oil supplies however had peaked in N and N and by N were declining 
 imports then six million barrels a day came primarily from venezuela and canada 
 but middle east supplies were growing in importance 
 by N the u.s. was bringing in two million barrels of arab oil a day more than N N of the N million barrels consumed daily 
 politics and economics conspired 
 japan and europe far more dependent on mideast oil than the u.s. would n't <unk> the arabs or trade off their precious supplies 
 the u.s. did manage to supply the dutch with oil by <unk> supplies once oil is shipped no one can tell its source

 the figures do n't include substantial dividends on holdings of bear stearns stock 
 mr. greenberg himself was paid $ N million before an estimated $ N million in dividends up from $ N million the year before 
 the increase is noted in the brokerage firm 's latest proxy statement filed with the securities and exchange commission 
 because it operates on a fiscal year bear stearns 's yearly filings are available much earlier than those of other firms 
 the latest period includes N months instead of N because bear stearns changed to a fiscal year ending in june instead of april 
 meanwhile bear stearns 's N stock and bond salesmen saw <unk> <unk> over the past year which the company says reflected lower commission revenue caused by a decline in investor activity in the markets 
 however bear stearns on monday reported improved earnings for its first quarter ended sept. N partly because of a N N increase in commissions during the quarter 
 william j. <unk> chief financial officer defended the <unk> salaries at bear stearns 
 all of us are on a base salary of $ N if the firm makes nothing and that 's pretty low as far as wall street goes mr. <unk> said 
 however bear stearns has never had an unprofitable year since its founding N years ago 
 four bear stearns executives besides the <unk> mr. greenberg were paid $ N million or more before dividends for the N months ended in june

 mr. <unk> will remain a member of the merchant bank 's board 
 mr. craven is widely credited with <unk> morgan grenfell 's <unk> on its core corporate finance fund management and banking activities over the past year 
 last year morgan grenfell shut down its ailing u.k. securities operations 
 mr. craven said his move to the <unk> means he will take a less active role in the day-to-day management of the group but he added that the merchant bank 's strategic focus remains unchanged 
 mr. craven joined morgan grenfell as group chief executive in may N a few months after the resignations of former chief executive christopher <unk> and other top officials because of the merchant bank 's role in guinness plc 's controversial takeover of <unk> 's co. in N 
 morgan grenfell had advised guinness on the bid which was surrounded by allegations that guinness used <unk> means to support the bid 's value

 the merchant bank also announced that finance director david <unk> is taking early retirement for personal reasons 
 his duties will be taken over by anthony <unk> who has been elected deputy chairman

 mr. craven said both messrs. <unk> and whittington had planned to leave the bank earlier but mr. craven had persuaded them to remain until the bank was in a healthy position 
 if there 's any <unk> about the departures it 's that they are leaving at a time when the business is in reasonably good shape and going forward very well

 par also said it was advised by the u.s. attorney for maryland that it is one of a number of companies being investigated by a federal grand jury for alleged violations of the federal food drug and cosmetic act 
 par a <unk> maker that has been plagued by management problems was already the subject of a federal criminal inquiry into the <unk> process and a food and drug administration investigation 
 a par spokesman said he understood the criminal investigation in maryland <unk> to matters par disclosed in july when par said it filed false drug information with the fda 
 at the time the company said it was <unk> one of its drugs and had stopped selling two others 
 the spokesman said he also understood that the inquiry related to the existence of an <unk> production book 
 the book noted changes made at the manufacturing level that were n't disclosed to the fda 
 par said it is <unk> in the investigation

 <unk> levine chairman said mr. <unk> had taken significant steps to restore the company 's credibility and sense of <unk> and integrity 
 just after midnight monday federal spending started to drop by $ N billion 
 what do you say we all close down the <unk> game go home and bank the $ N billion 
 that 's essentially what budget director richard darman is suggesting and we think he deserves as much support as he can get 
 if human beings ca n't cut federal spending <unk> and they ca n't let the computers do it 
 congress with a measure of white house <unk> has been <unk> the spending accounts for years under the cover of omnibus appropriations bills 
 indeed without earlier <unk> the current sequester of $ N billion would have been even larger 
 we suspect voters are fed up with the <unk> 
 consider for instance that even yesterday 's widely publicized sequester is likely to be <unk> if business as usual is allowed to prevail 
 under the law gramm-rudman 's <unk> in federal programs are supposed to be permanent 
 social security and spending for poor people are <unk> 
 however the associated press 's account of the monday sequester order signed by president bush neatly captured the <unk> congress shows toward the notion of a legally <unk> commitment 
 lawmakers have been saying for weeks that they plan to roll back the cuts as soon as they agree to a compromise on a <unk> bill 
 mr. darman 's <unk> to save the sequester was backed up yesterday by white house press secretary marlin fitzwater 
 there is some feeling here that the cuts are the way to go 
 it will reduce spending in a very effective fashion 
 this attitude is being <unk> away by <unk> around washington as little more than tough talk 
 it looks to us like a golden opportunity for george bush to <unk> off at the <unk> all this talk about a <unk> <unk> presidency 
 mr. bush would be acting in the public interest if he let the washington <unk> who manipulate these budgets the bureaucrats the lobbyists the congressional staffers live for just one year on a restricted diet 
 ask <unk> <unk> thin is in 
 senator phil <unk> pointed out monday that in the N years before gramm-rudman was enacted in N federal spending grew by about N N a year since the law it 's grown at under N N annually 
 another major factor in this positive trend was ronald reagan 's decision early in his presidency to fight the budget war on the expenditure side rather than raising taxes 
 george bush 's continued support of the tax dam <unk> this strategy of <unk> congress to make choices among competing priorities rather than just saying yes to all the <unk> special-interest <unk> that fill the <unk> trough 
 if washington 's <unk> ever succeed in <unk> the tax dam americans will be <unk> in a red sea of new spending programs such as <unk> child care 
 child care was one of the many <unk> bills pulled out of the senate 's reconciliation bill last friday

 the stock market 's dizzying gyrations during the past few days have made a lot of individual investors wish they could buy some sort of insurance 
 after all they wo n't soon forget the stock bargains that became available after the october N crash 
 but while they want to be on the alert for similar buying opportunities now they 're afraid of being <unk> by another <unk> plunge 
 the solution at least for some investors may be a hedging technique that 's well known to players in the <unk> market 
 called a married put the technique is carried out by purchasing a stock and simultaneously buying a put option on that stock 
 it 's like fire insurance says harrison roth the senior options strategist at <unk> & co 
 because a put option gives its owner the right but not the obligation to sell a fixed number of shares of the stock at a stated price on or before the option 's expiration date the investor is protected against a sudden drop in the stock 's price 
 but most investment advisers do n't recommend using married puts all the time 
 that 's because the cost of buying put options <unk> into an investor 's profit when stock prices rise 
 this is the type of fire insurance you only buy when the nearby woods are on fire says mr. roth 
 you always want your house insured but you do n't always feel the need for your investments to be insured 
 in addition to hedging new stock purchases the <unk> technique can be used to protect stocks that an investor already owns 
 in either case the investor faces three possible <unk> 
 if the stock goes up in price between now and the put 's expiration date the put will probably expire <unk> 
 the investor will be out the cost of the put which is called the premium and this loss will reduce the stock-market profit 
 if the stock stays at the same price between now and the put 's expiration date the investor 's loss will be limited to the cost of the put less any amount realized from a closing sale of the put 
 the <unk> scenario would be if the put expires <unk> 
 if the price of the stock declines the put will increase in value 
 once the stock price is less than the exercise price or strike price of the put the gain will match the loss on the stock dollar for dollar 
 the put <unk> a minimum selling price for the stock during its life 
 when a stock falls below the put 's strike price the investor simply sells the stock at a loss and simultaneously sells the put at a profit 
 or the investor can exercise the put by <unk> the stock to his or her broker in return for payment from another investor who has sold a put on the same stock 
 brokers handle such transactions through the options clearing corp. which guarantees all option trades 
 the accompanying table shows how this strategy would work for three stocks 
 though not reflected in the table an investor should know that the cost of the option insurance can be partially offset by any dividends that the stock pays 
 for example tenneco inc. pays a quarterly dividend of N cents which would be received before the february option expires and thus reduce the cost of using the technique by that amount 
 in this case the investor 's risk would n't exceed N N of the total investment 
 to <unk> the calculations commissions on the option and underlying stock are n't included in the table 
 there are more than N stocks on which options may be bought and sold including some over-the-counter stocks 
 but some investors might prefer a simpler strategy then hedging their individual holdings 
 they can do this by purchasing index puts which are simply put options on indexes that match broad baskets of stocks 
 for instance the most popular index option is the s&p N option commonly called the <unk> 
 it is based on the stocks that make up standard & poor 's <unk> index 
 unlike options on individual issues index options are settled only in cash and no stock is ever tendered 
 but while index options are convenient they have several <unk> 
 for one thing an investor 's portfolio might not closely match the s&p N 
 as a result the <unk> insurance may or may not fully protect an investor 's holdings in the event of a market decline 
 in addition <unk> options were suspended from trading last friday afternoon after the stock-market sell-off got under way and trading in the <unk> futures contract was halted 
 so an investor who wanted to realize a profit on <unk> puts after the trading suspension would have been out of luck 
 on the other hand only a handful of individual issues were suspended from trading on friday 
 normally once the underlying investment is suspended from trading the options on those investments also do n't trade 
 ultimately whether the insurance provided by purchasing puts is <unk> depends on the cost of the options 
 that cost rises in times of high market volatility 
 but it still might be cheaper than taking a major hit 
 the protection from using married puts is clearly superior to that <unk> by another options strategy some investors consider using during troubled times selling call options on stocks the investor owns 
 a call option is similar to a put except that it gives its owner the right to buy shares at a stated price until expiration 
 selling a call option gives an investor a small buffer against a stock-market decline 
 that 's because it reduces the cost of the stock by the amount of premium received from the sale of the call 
 but if the price of the stock rises above the strike price of the option the stock is almost certain to be called away 
 and in that case the investor misses out on any major upside gain 
 these calculations exclude the effect of commissions paid and dividends received from the stock 
 all prices are as of monday 's close 
 hopes for quick enactment of pending deficit-reduction legislation faded as efforts to streamline the house version in advance of a house-senate conference broke down 
 house leaders had hoped to follow the senate 's lead by getting an agreement from house committee chairmen under which they would drop items that would n't reduce the fiscal N budget deficit from the house-passed bill before the negotiations with the senate began 
 but the effort became <unk> on the question of what would become of other issues ranging from cutting the capital-gains tax to child care to repeal of <unk> insurance 
 many members feel there are important features of the house bill that should be enacted speaker thomas foley d. wash said 
 if there is any support for reducing the bill it is <unk> on their desire to see them passed in another form 
 now those items will be discussed in a house-senate conference which could begin as soon as today with the expectation that they could either be resolved there or placed into other legislation 
 you 've got to give these chairmen the opportunity to see if they can work things out said house budget committee chairman leon <unk> d. calif 
 this is a democratic process you ca n't <unk> anything around here 
 white house budget director richard darman has said he would continue to press to keep the capital-gains provision in the final version of the bill unless the house drops many of its costly provisions 
 senate leaders had hoped to be able to send a compromise version of the measure to president bush by the end of the week but speaker foley said that was n't likely 
 failure to pass the bill meant that $ N billion in across-the-board spending cuts took effect monday under the gramm-rudman budget law

 a surprising surge in the u.s. trade deficit raised fears that the nation 's export drive has stalled and caused new turmoil in financial markets 
 the merchandise trade deficit widened in august to $ N billion the commerce department reported a sharp deterioration from july 's $ N billion and the largest deficit of any month this year 
 exports fell for the second month in a row while imports rose to a record 
 this is one of the worst trade releases we 've had since the dollar <unk> out in N said <unk> dennis chief international economist at james capel inc 
 like most analysts mr. dennis was <unk> to read too much into one month 's numbers but he said it indicates perhaps that the balance in the u.s. economy is not as good as we 've been led to believe 
 the number had a troubling effect on wall street suggesting that more fundamental economic problems may <unk> last friday 's stock market slide 
 the dow jones industrial average tumbled more than N points after the report 's release before recovering to close N points lower at N 
 this bad trade number raises some deeper issues about the market decline said norman robertson chief economist for mellon bank 
 it raises questions about more <unk> problems the budget deficit and the trade deficit and the <unk> lack of ability to come to <unk> with them 
 the trade report drew yet another <unk> parallel to october N 
 on oct. N of that year the announcement of an unusually large august trade deficit helped trigger a steep market decline 
 the slide continued until the record <unk> market drop on oct. N 
 in N however the news was the latest in a string of disappointments on trade while the current report comes after a period of improvement 
 the bleak trade report was played down by the bush administration 
 commerce secretary robert mosbacher called the worsening trade figures disappointing after two very good months 
 and white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the deficit was an unwelcome increase adding that we 're hopeful that it simply is a <unk> situation and will turn around 
 but the figures reinforced the view of many private analysts that the improvement in the u.s. trade deficit has run out of steam 
 the figures today add further evidence to support the view that the improvement in the u.s. trade deficit has essentially stalled out at a level of about a $ N billion annual rate said jeffrey scott a research fellow at the institute for international economics here 
 that 's still an improvement over last year but it leads one to conclude that basically we 've gotten all the <unk> we can out of past dollar depreciation and past marginal cuts in the federal budget deficit 
 exports declined for the second consecutive month in august slipping N N to $ N billion the commerce department reported 
 imports on the other hand leaped N N to a record $ N billion 
 not only was august 's deficit far worse than july 's but the government revised the july figure substantially from the $ N billion deficit it had initially reported last month 
 many economists contend that deep cuts in the u.s. budget deficit are needed before further trade improvement can occur 
 that 's because the budget deficit feeds an enormous appetite in this country for both foreign goods and foreign capital overwhelming the nation 's capacity to export 
 people are sick and tired of hearing about these deficits but the imbalances are still there and they are still a problem said mr. robertson 
 in addition the rise in the value of the dollar against foreign currencies over the past several months has increased the price of u.s. products in overseas markets and hurt the country 's competitiveness 
 since march exports have been virtually flat 
 at the same time william t. <unk> international vice president at the u.s. chamber of commerce notes clearly the stronger dollar has made imports more attractive by causing their prices to decline 
 most economists expect the slowing u.s. economy to curb demand for imports 
 but they <unk> little substantial progress in exports unless the dollar and the federal budget deficit come down 
 the best result we could get from these numbers would be to see the administration and congress get serious about putting the u.s. on an internationally competitive economic footing said howard lewis vice president of international economic affairs at the national association of manufacturers 
 that must start with cutting the federal budget deficit 
 august 's decline in exports reflected <unk> in sales of industrial supplies capital goods and food abroad and increases in sales of motor vehicles parts and engines 
 the jump in imports stemmed from across-the-board increases in purchases of foreign goods 
 the numbers were adjusted for usual seasonal fluctuations

 steve jobs took a step back from the <unk> of personal-computer technology in an effort to spur sales of next inc. 's new machine 
 mr. jobs moved to remedy a couple of his computer 's <unk> yesterday by lowering the <unk> price for a next machine by $ N or N N if the buyer chooses a hard-disk drive as an alternative to next 's <unk> device 
 the hard drive which is the storage device of choice for virtually every desktop computer user also now will supplement next 's <unk> optical device if buyers pay full price 
 mr. jobs <unk> of apple computer inc. founded next four years ago in the hopes of <unk> a revolution in the way desktop computers are designed and used 
 his next computer introduced about a year ago and aimed primarily at university computer users sports <unk> graphics digital sound <unk> <unk> and a <unk> black design 
 but the computer was proving a hard sell because of its high price a lack of software and an optical <unk> device that was too slow 
 the machine began shipping at the end of last year 
 the closely held company has n't disclosed sales 
 however most universities that have bought the machines say they are buying small numbers for evaluation purposes 
 universities can now buy a next computer without an optical storage device for $ N 
 a computer with the optical device will still cost $ N but from now on next will outfit every computer with a hard drive and supply one at no cost to those who have already bought next machines 
 commercial customers can purchase the same system through businessland inc. a computer retailer based in san jose calif. for roughly $ N more 
 mr. jobs said the changes were prompted by requests from customers who are frustrated with the performance of the optical device which is n't offered as standard equipment by any rivals 
 another factor was that customers were asking why do n't you give us a cheaper system mr. jobs said at a conference on university computing here 
 <unk> devices can handle very large amounts of data and make it far easier to <unk> film <unk> or audio <unk> with a computer 
 but the technology while <unk> is far slower than the widely used hard drives 
 to get around the delays caused by the optical device businessland which is next 's exclusive dealer to corporations has for months been advising customers to purchase hard drives with the machines 
 next 's decision to rely on the <unk> hard drive in every next computer does n't signal a retreat from optical storage said mr. jobs who for years has said this technology will play a crucial role in the next decade 
 we 're extremely committed to optical storage technology he said 
 we think everything will go this way in a few years 
 he said that the next generation of optical drives will be as fast as hard drives but he depends on outside suppliers for the devices 
 but university computer specialists who welcomed the move called it a necessary retreat from the cutting edge of technology and one that 's likely to increase next 's sales on <unk> 
 from the standpoint of being on the <unk> of technology this is a step <unk> said jerry w. <unk> a senior computing manager for the california state university system 
 but it will definitely boost next 's sales 
 universities however say next 's prices must go even lower before large numbers of students purchase the machine 
 we 'd still like to see a student model priced at about $ N said ronald johnson director of academic computing at minnesota 's <unk> <unk> college which has bought eight next machines 
 broad acceptance of next 's computer also is <unk> by difficulty in distributing software for it 
 most software is distributed on cheap <unk> disks but the next computer does n't come with a device that reads them 
 next 's computer also needs more software applications but mr. jobs said he expects more soon 
 he said he expects lotus development corp. to introduce a next version of its popular N <unk> program in N 
 educators added that next needs to soon offer a color version of its computer 
 every major maker offers computers with color displays 
 next wo n't comment on when it will do the same but is believed to have a color model under development

 he said the company was encouraged by <unk> it received from selected customers now testing version N 
 the red ink came as no surprise to wall street but analysts said they saw <unk> hints of a further delay in volume shipments of version N a <unk> of continued losses in the fourth quarter 
 the loss is in line with our expectations said john c. maxwell iii an analyst with dillon read & co. in new york 
 he added gross margins and operating profit eroded quite dramatically from the prior quarter along with sales of existing software product lines like <unk> and <unk> 
 the success of a new product in the <unk> line is needed 
 and while the company has n't made a <unk> statement it now looks like that 's not going to be anytime soon mr. maxwell said 
 the company said in a statement that it expects to ship new products during the next two quarters 
 it now looks like <unk> <unk> version N is n't going to be widely available until the first quarter of N said david <unk> an analyst with montgomery securities in san francisco 
 this is the second delay now in getting the product out the door 
 it does <unk> the pain somewhat 
 mr. maxwell said unless the company can start shipments of the new product sometime this quarter the fourth-quarter loss is likely to be comparable to the third quarter 's 
 if the company can start to ship during this quarter it could stem some if not all of the red ink he said

 these two new crowd families lived in the same apartment building with the <unk> <unk> <unk> on top of the gutfreund <unk> 
 the <unk> <unk> started up from the gutfreund landing and susan gutfreund used to turn off its light to give the impression that there was no higher floor 
 eventually mr. <unk> broke his <unk> in the dark 
 then the <unk> determined to put up a <unk> christmas tree weighing a quarter of a ton to <unk> their holiday guests 
 for this a crane needed to be mounted on the <unk> ' <unk> 
 the <unk> did not give permission 
 but the gutfreund workers went ahead anyway only to be captured in <unk> by joan <unk> who called the police 
 before the <unk> finally left this unfriendly environment for a <unk> <unk> on fifth avenue and an <unk> mansion with a specially <unk> $ N million garage in paris the <unk> had obtained an injunction to prevent any future <unk> of trees and in a <unk> spirit hit both the <unk> and the building with a $ N million lawsuit 
 nothing less it seemed could <unk> them for their <unk> 
 where had all the money come from 
 the young john gutfreund had been discovered by <unk> salomon of salomon bros. when he was still a <unk> liberal and put to work as a trader and then as a <unk> <unk> 
 get off your he would <unk> say the authors 
 rising in the firm he became powerful and <unk> though his new wife susan made him <unk> in the <unk> columns with her <unk> spending habits and flamboyant <unk> 
 after he had been head of the company for N N years he and his partners sold it to <unk> a powerful commodity trading outfit for $ N million in <unk> stock 
 limited partner <unk> salomon whose family name had been on the firm 's door for N years and who had hoped it would be there forever was not <unk> 
 mr. gutfreund collected $ N million while <unk> salomon got $ N million much less than if he had conducted the sale 
 i felt <unk> he later said 
 worse salomon 's timing had been off 
 its profits unlike <unk> 's soared over the next two years and had it held out salomon could have gotten an even bigger <unk> 
 the book also <unk> the not <unk> <unk> surrounding the changing of the guard at lehman bros. and other grand old firms 
 often the <unk> conservative <unk> investment bankers were <unk> by crude traders when angered he <unk> so <unk> that his face <unk> and his <unk> eyes narrowed into tiny <unk> the authors say of lehman 's lewis <unk> 
 the earlier generation of our crowd bankers <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> had stressed above all <unk> tradition <unk> and reputation 
 they were old-fashioned elegant <unk> who happened to be of german jewish <unk> 
 but in the harsh world of today 's wall street they have lost out to more aggressive and sometimes less <unk> <unk> 
 the <unk> prefers the <unk> of other birds and <unk> out their eggs 
 but the old guard hired the new crowd people it brought in its own <unk> 
 so as the old crowd <unk> from the branch it should n't have been too surprised 
 the old guard had every right however to <unk> the newcomers ' new ways of making money such as <unk> 
 a fortune article on saul steinberg was entitled fear and <unk> in the corporate <unk> 
 their other <unk> has been corporate takeovers often hostile and financed by junk bonds 
 hostile takeovers are quite a new phenomenon 
 sometimes they are <unk> but often not 
 first by making management focus on short-term results they inhibit building for the future just the opposite of japan 
 second a long-term shareholder of a good company need n't worry too much when the stock price drops temporarily it will bounce back 
 but if a raider takes over when the stock is weak the shareholder never gets his recovery 
 the raiders meanwhile have <unk> their own pattern for spending their new millions 
 as described in the new crowd they take on ambitious new wives move to greenwich conn. or <unk> n.y. buy ok pictures and let their wives share the wealth with <unk> 
 having donated heavily to <unk> they demand a place on their boards 
 the book is <unk> about this <unk> <unk> struggle for respectability which has its <unk> aspects 
 however on balance the charity game helps america 
 if those who have the money do n't get involved with the <unk> and the charities then city hall will do it badly 
 it has been <unk> observed that the main thing wrong with tainted money is <unk> ai <unk> enough of it 
 a handful of the new crowd operators have crossed the line from the <unk> to the illegal and have ended up in the <unk> or paying huge fines 
 ivan boesky dennis levine martin <unk> victor and steven posner and now michael <unk> and perhaps <unk> helmsley 
 the <unk> office that ivan boesky vacated for a prison cell had previously contained commodity operators marc rich and <unk> green today <unk> from a potential century apiece of jail sentences 
 the old crowd is deeply concerned by the backlash from all this 
 however the phenomenon is not specifically jewish 
 it has always been true that those outside the club want to climb in and that a few will cut corners in the process 
 some pretty <unk> stuff built the <unk> families ' fifth avenue and newport <unk> and <unk> their daughters ' <unk> to foreign <unk> 
 mr. boesky was a <unk> compared to jay gould and jim <unk> and commodore <unk> thought nothing of <unk> judges and legislators 
 so who knows 
 in a generation or two some of the new crowd may <unk> true respectability perhaps to be <unk> in turn by a later <unk> of unscrupulous <unk> 
 or perhaps wall street when it has suffered enough will realize that finance is a service industry and change its <unk>

 in august soon after wang laboratories inc. reported a staggering $ N million loss and replaced its president two boston sales representatives sent customers a letter saying we fully expect that you will soon be reading stories in the press reporting the amazing comeback at wang 
 how soon wang will stage a comeback or if it will at all are still matters of debate 
 but wang salespeople are trying to cope with the biggest challenge any marketer can face selling the products of a company that is on the ropes 
 if your prospect is feeling risk the whole time and you 're not feeling as if you 're backed up by a stable company you 've lost it before you 've begun says mary ann <unk> a <unk> mass. sales <unk> and consultant who works with high technology companies 
 it can happen in any industry 
 consider the difficulties faced by <unk> salespeople when the car was tainted by false charges of sudden acceleration or exxon dealers ' problems in the wake of the <unk> oil spill 
 like thousands of salespeople before them wang 's are finding ways to combat the bad news 
 it 's very important that we <unk> confidence even though within the family we know there 's a lot of hard work ahead said richard miller the <unk> mass. computer concern 's new president in a video message to salespeople a month after he took over 
 wang got into financial trouble because of bloated overhead and overly optimistic sales forecasts 
 its <unk> minicomputers and word processors have lost ground to cheaper personal computers 
 last year it funded its high employment by heavy borrowing and it suffered huge losses when sales turned down instead of rising 
 after the company reported red ink for the fiscal third quarter wang 's marketing department provided the sales force answers to questions such as how could you not have known you were going to lose $ N million and is wang still a viable company 
 salespeople try to push their products and avoid discussions of finances 
 responding to such questions is defensive says kenneth <unk> wang 's vice president marketing 
 that 's <unk> to the art of selling 
 moreover he notes that analyzing financial results <unk> a problem for a salesman who is n't particularly familiar with a balance sheet 
 at one sales strategy meeting an executive suggested ordering salespeople to become experts on the annual report 
 mr. miller vetoed that even i ca n't understand all the <unk> he says 
 instead he says if the salespeople can get the customers to consider wang 's products on their merits he or a top financial officer will try to <unk> the fears about finances 
 mike <unk> a salesman in wang 's austin texas office has a <unk> method we tell them $ N billion companies do n't go out of business 
 we tell them all the major companies are having financial difficulties 
 numerous computer companies are having sales <unk> and earnings declines but very few have had losses comparable to wang 's or are carrying such a large debt load 
 mr. miller says that after a sharp sales slump in july and august sales stabilized in september 
 although wang will report a loss for the first quarter ended sept. N and the full fiscal year mr. miller says he expects the company will return to profitability by the fourth quarter 
 experts on sales technique say anyone representing a troubled company must walk a fine line 
 if a salesman <unk> his credibility in this time of trouble it will be a problem for the long run says george <unk> a <unk> nev. sales consultant and author of the marketing edge 
 still says john sullivan a management <unk> with daniel roberts inc. of boston who has held senior sales positions at polaroid and <unk> the customer will react to strength 
 ignore the present condition 
 show it 's business as usual 
 that is n't easy 
 wang 's customers are data processing managers who want to be sure that their suppliers are stable <unk> companies that will be around to fix bugs and upgrade computers for years to come 
 for buyers these are <unk> decisions says jean <unk> who <unk> a network of wang computers in the <unk> department at boston university 
 the university is considering <unk> a $ N system to store applications electronically 
 before the really bad news we were looking at wang fairly seriously she says 
 but their present financial condition means i 'd have a hard time convincing the vice president in charge of purchasing 
 ms. <unk> adds at some point we 'd have to ask how do we know that in three years you wo n't be in chapter N 
 during the past year wang has developed new products and a new strategy and hired a new president 
 wang 's overall product line is still not as good as other vendors but they 've come a long way says steven <unk> a consultant with market researcher gartner group stamford conn 
 they were on the road to recovery in terms of customer attitudes until this bad quarter happened 
 the first priority for wang 's sales force is to make sure it holds on to existing customers 
 wang 's installed base is one of its greatest assets and many of those customers remain extremely loyal 
 but even before wang 's latest financial troubles surfaced some customers were trying to wall off their wang installations so other departments would n't add wang says chris <unk> a former wang marketer who is now a market analyst with <unk> group a market research firm in stamford conn 
 one wang salesman who left the company in july recalls that when he tried to sell products to eastman kodak he worked to <unk> support from internal allies but those allies became skeptical as they saw the <unk> 
 the more recent losses were really devastating 
 new customers the source of higher commissions for salespeople and the key to wang 's long-term viability are even tougher 
 rick lynch a former top salesman in wang 's boston office referring to wang 's mainstay computer line says you ca n't sell a <unk> to a new customer 
 mr. lynch left wang this summer for <unk> systems inc. a software vendor 
 the financial problems are particularly frustrating for salespeople pushing wang 's image systems which convert paper forms to electronic documents 
 consultants say that wang 's technology is among the best available in the image market 
 but salespeople often found that news of wang 's problems <unk> their sales efforts 
 william <unk> a former sales manager in indianapolis says that his office had all but sold a $ N million image system to pharmaceutical maker eli lilly & co 
 when they were making the decision all hell broke loose with the finances 
 he says the lilly executives told him they could n't take the risk with wang 
 mr. <unk> say he does n't blame lilly 
 buyers have to rely on a supplier continually upgrading and replacing the product he says 
 when a company <unk> that it 's hard to go with wang 
 for mr. <unk> who says he used to earn as much as $ N a year at wang it was one more reason to quit 
 he is now president of <unk> homes inc. an indianapolis contractor 
 it can be hard for a <unk> to fight off feelings of <unk> 
 brian <unk> a former wang salesman in <unk> new york says you have pride in your job 
 you think you can go out and turn things around 
 it 's a tough thing when you ca n't

 <unk> merck 's new <unk> drug had higher sales than any other prescription medicine has ever achieved in the u.s. in the year following introduction the company said

 lilly attributed record third-quarter and nine-month results to world-wide gains for pharmaceuticals medical instruments and <unk> products despite poor exchange rates for the dollar that slowed sales abroad

 that compares with per-share earnings from continuing operations of N cents the year earlier including discontinued operations per-share was N cents a year ago 
 the per-share estimates mean the consumer-products company 's net income increased to between $ N million and $ N million from $ N million the <unk> period 
 analysts estimate colgate 's world-wide third-quarter sales rose about N N to $ N billion 
 mr. mark attributed the earnings growth to strong sales in latin america asia and europe 
 results were also bolstered by a very meaningful increase in operating profit by colgate 's u.s. business mr. mark said 
 operating profit at colgate 's u.s. household products and <unk> businesses jumped N N in the quarter mr. mark added 
 he said the improvement was a result of cost savings achieved by consolidating manufacturing operations <unk> two sales organizations and focusing more carefully the company 's promotional activities 
 the estimated improvement in colgate 's u.s. operations took some analysts by surprise 
 colgate 's household products business which includes such brands as <unk> <unk> detergent and <unk> <unk> has been a weak performer 
 analysts estimate colgate 's sales of household products in the u.s. were flat for the quarter and they estimated operating margins at only N N to N N 
 if you could say their business in the u.s. was <unk> but great everywhere else that would be fine says <unk> austin an analyst with wertheim schroder & co

 mr. mark conceded that colgate 's domestic business apart from its highly profitable hill 's pet products unit has lagged 
 we 've done a lot to improve u.s. results and a lot more will be done mr. mark said

 deeply <unk> in both the book review <unk> nature <unk> by stephen macdonald leisure & arts sept. N and the books reviewed is the assumption that global warming is entirely a result of human activity

 in the absence of humans would the earth enjoy a constant climate over the long term 
 clearly not 
 about N years ago the last ice age ended 
 enormous ice sheets retreated from the face of north america northern europe and asia 
 this global warming must have been entirely natural nobody would blame it on a few hundred thousand <unk> hunting <unk> and <unk> around in <unk> 
 furthermore no bell has yet <unk> to announce the end of this <unk> episode of natural global warming 
 it is probably continuing and may well account for most of or all of <unk> global warming 
 i <unk> to no one in my regard for our <unk> heritage but if we are serious about global warming we must look at the big picture and not allow the dominant culture to lock us into the <unk> warming scenario as the sole model for discussion 
 <unk> <unk> <unk> department university of 
 the internal revenue service plans to restructure itself more like a private corporation 
 in addition the <unk> agency says that it will take the unusual step of looking to the private sector to fill two new <unk> positions to guide the <unk> agency a comptroller to oversee daily finances and a chief information officer to update the information system which includes probably the largest computer data base in the world 
 the irs also said that it would create the position of chief financial officer who will be hired from within the agency 
 irs commissioner fred t. goldberg said the changes are intended to bring accountability to the agency which has an annual budget of more than $ N billion and <unk> about $ N trillion a year 
 my assessment and everyone 's assessment is that we do not have the kinds of information that let us <unk> and effectively <unk> and execute our budget mr. goldberg said 
 and we do n't have internal controls and discipline that we need to have to spend $ N billion properly 
 mr. goldberg who took over as head of the irs in july has been <unk> by what he considers the <unk> waste and lack of coordination among the branches of the vast federal agency 
 the irs operates on a computer system designed in N which it has been trying to modernize for years 
 and the agency which operated throughout fiscal N with a $ N million budget <unk> has been under a hiring freeze since last fall 
 the new commissioner says that closer scrutiny of how the agency uses its resources will go a long way toward <unk> its ability to collect more tax revenue 
 i think that you will see a significant improvement in the budget <unk> and execution process which in turn i believe will result in a significant increase in revenue he said 
 the irs hopes to fill the new positions soon 
 <unk> it would <unk> career civil <unk> from within the agency but mr. goldberg said he plans to <unk> the world for the chief information officer and the comptroller 
 although the jobs will probably pay between $ N and $ N a year irs officials are confident that they can attract <unk> candidates from the private sector 
 you 're telling someone they can spend the next three or four or five or six years of their life bringing about the most difficult and costly modernization of an information system on the civil side ever mr. goldberg said 
 on the comptroller side you 're developing and making work financial controls governing a $ N billion budget 
 when <unk> <unk> <unk> the leader of the <unk> coup in panama was buried his body <unk> several <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> and broken <unk> and <unk> 
 they were the signature of his adversary panamanian leader manuel antonio noriega 
 the rebel officer 's slow and painful death at the headquarters of panama 's <unk> <unk> was personally <unk> by gen. noriega says a u.s. official with access to intelligence reports 
 leaping into <unk> sinking into <unk> of <unk> and <unk> mr. noriega has put to death some N of his troops involved in the coup according to u.s. officials monitoring <unk> and <unk> <unk> in panama city 
 he is now changing the place he <unk> every night sometimes more than once a night 
 his meals are most often prepared by women he trusts his full-time <unk> <unk> <unk> and her mother <unk> 
 and he is collecting the names of those who <unk> the <unk> to <unk> them during their brief time in control of his headquarters 
 more enemies to be dealt with 
 in the two weeks since the <unk> which the u.s. <unk> backed mr. noriega has been at his most <unk> and efficient in maintaining power 
 yet while the failed coup is a major u.s. foreign policy embarrassment it is merely the latest chapter in a <unk> relationship between mr. noriega and washington that <unk> back three decades 
 america 's war on the dictator over the past two years following his indictment on drug charges in february N is the <unk> of that relationship 
 before american foreign policy set out to destroy noriega it helped create him out of the <unk> of panama 's long history of <unk> and <unk> 
 for most of the past N years the marriage was one of convenience 
 in N for example when mr. noriega was both a <unk> at an elite military academy in peru and a <unk> for the u.s. defense intelligence agency he was <unk> by <unk> authorities for allegedly <unk> and <unk> beating a <unk> according to a u.s. embassy cable from that period 
 the woman had nearly died 
 but u.s. intelligence rather than rein in or cut loose its new spy merely filed the report away 
 mr. noriega 's tips on emerging <unk> at his school were deemed more important to u.s. interests 
 from that point on the u.s. would make a practice of <unk> the panamanian 's <unk> 
 the u.s. has <unk> and later turned against many <unk> but none quite so <unk> 
 the <unk> mr. noriega is n't as smooth as the shah of iran as <unk> as nicaragua 's <unk> <unk> as imperial as ferdinand marcos of the philippines or as bloody as <unk> 's baby <unk> <unk> 
 yet he has proved more <unk> than any of them 
 and out of necessity the u.s. can make mistakes and still hope to remove him from power but a single error on his part could cost him his life 
 the u.s. underestimated noriega all along says <unk> moss a former ambassador to panama 
 he has <unk> the art of survival 
 in keeping with america 's long history of <unk> up mr. noriega recent u.s. actions have extended rather than <unk> his survival 
 mr. noriega might have fallen of his own weight in N because of panama 's dire economic situation says mr. moss but increasing external pressure has only given him additional <unk> for repression and a <unk> for his own <unk> 
 if the u.s. had sat back and done nothing he might not have made it through N mr. moss contends 
 perhaps most important mr. noriega 's allies have intervened to encourage in some cases to demand that the dictator maintain his grip of the <unk> 
 one colombian drug boss upon hearing in N that gen. noriega was negotiating with the u.s. to abandon his command for a comfortable <unk> sent him a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with his name 
 he is <unk> says the rev. fernando <unk> who has led catholic church opposition against noriega 
 the americans have left him without a way out 
 it is easy to fight when you do n't have any other option 
 his chief advantage in the fight his intimate knowledge of american ways and weaknesses 
 mr. noriega often tells friends that patience is the best weapon against the <unk> who have a short attention span and little <unk> for lasting confrontation 
 the u.s. discovered the young tony noriega in late N when he was in his second year at the <unk> military academy in <unk> according to former u.s. intelligence officials 
 the contact occurred through mr. noriega 's <unk> a panamanian diplomat based in peru named luis carlos noriega <unk> 
 luis carlos knowing that helping the americans could advance the career of any panamanian officer <unk> tony 's reports on the leftist <unk> he observed among his fellow students and more important among his officers and <unk> 
 a spy was born 
 it was a <unk> experience for the <unk> and slightly built mr. noriega who was known to his friends as cara la <unk> <unk> face 
 born the <unk> son of his father 's <unk> he was raised on the mean streets of the central market district of panama city 
 tony was four years older than most of his fellow <unk> and gained admission to the academy because his brother had <unk> his birth certificate 
 he considered himself <unk> superior to his <unk> <unk> many of whom were <unk> sons sent by their <unk> families to the highly disciplined <unk> academy as a sort of reform school 
 in his peaked military cap and neatly pressed <unk> uniform noriega felt more respected and powerful than ever in his <unk> life friends from the period say 
 he had an elegant uniform with gold <unk> in a country where there was a <unk> of <unk> where officers were the elite with special privileges recalls <unk> <unk> a fellow student in peru and a <unk> friend 
 mr. noriega 's relationship to american intelligence agencies became <unk> in either N or N intelligence officials say 
 his commanding officer at the <unk> province garrison major <unk> torrijos gave him an intriguing <unk> mr. noriega would <unk> the province 's first intelligence service 
 the spy network would serve two clients the panamanian government by monitoring political opponents in the region and the u.s. by tracking the growing communist influence in the unions organized at united fruit co. 's <unk> <unk> in <unk> del <unk> and puerto <unk> 
 united fruit was one of the two largest <unk> to panama 's national income 
 satisfying its interests was a priority for any panamanian leader 
 mr. noriega 's initial <unk> was only $ N to $ N a month plus <unk> gifts of liquor or <unk> from the american <unk> a former intelligence official says 
 it was modest pay by american standards but a healthy boost to his small military salary which fellow officers remember as having been $ N to $ N monthly 
 he did it very well recalls <unk> <unk> a former panamanian <unk> who managed mr. noriega and his operation 
 he started building the files that helped him gain power 
 a national guard job assumed by <unk> noriega in N as chief of the transit police in david city capital of the <unk> province was <unk> for an <unk> <unk> 
 by <unk> taxi and bus drivers who needed licenses he gained a ready <unk> of information 
 he knew which local <unk> had been caught driving drunk which had been found with their <unk> 
 this proved particularly valuable to the panamanian government in N when union leaders were planning a may day march that the government feared could turn violent 
 mr. noriega had learned that a local union leader was sleeping with the wife of his deputy 
 so he <unk> the information on <unk> that he distributed throughout the <unk> city of puerto <unk> which was ruled by united fruit co 
 the campaign so divided union leaders that the government found them far easier to control 
 it was like a play on broadway recalls mr. <unk> 
 noriega managed the whole thing 
 he was <unk> 
 noriega was an expert at <unk> and <unk> people 
 during his years in <unk> however mr. noriega also revealed himself as an officer as <unk> as he was <unk> 
 <unk> <unk> a local lawyer and human-rights monitor recalls an <unk> noriega visiting <unk> in their cells at the <unk> zone garrison headquarters in david where he had his offices 
 mr. noriega would order them all to take off their clothes and run around the <unk> naked laughing at them and then retreating to his office 
 people started wondering if something was wrong with him mr. <unk> recalls 
 but through this period so far as the u.s. military was concerned mr. noriega was a model recruit 
 he signed up for intelligence and <unk> training under american officers at fort <unk> in panama in july N according to a copy of a N resume with details mr. noriega has since classified as secret 
 he flew to fort <unk> n.c. in september of that year for a course in psychological operations returning to the school of the <unk> in panama for a <unk> course called military intelligence for officers 
 some american officers interpreted his eagerness and <unk> as a sign of loyalty but they did so <unk> 
 he rose to chief of intelligence in panama 's <unk> <unk> in N after providing <unk> dictator torrijos the critical support to defeat a coup attempt against him a year earlier 
 he became gen. torrijos 's <unk> shadow and the holder of all panama 's secrets 
 mr. noriega by now a <unk> <unk> expanded his contacts to include the cubans not to mention the <unk> the taiwanese and any other intelligence service that came knocking 
 when u.s. diplomats complained to the cia of col. noriega 's <unk> intelligence experts always insisted that his <unk> was first to the americans 
 early on in the state department we took to calling him the <unk> in <unk> to his ability to simultaneously milk the <unk> intelligence services of cuba and the united states recalls francis j. <unk> who as deputy assistant secretary of state for <unk> affairs first ran across reports about mr. noriega in N 
 some of us <unk> how our intelligence people could put so much stock in his information when he was just as close to the cubans 
 even at this early stage drugs caused additional concerns 
 during the nixon administration the drug enforcement administration became <unk> at the extent of the <unk> 's connections to arrested drug traffickers 
 one <unk> agent drew up a list of five options for dealing with col. noriega one of which was assassination 
 the head of the <unk> at the time john ingersoll <unk> the assassination plan 
 but he did fly to panama to <unk> dictator torrijos on the drug ties of panamanian officials including mr. noriega 
 mr. ingersoll later recalled that gen. torrijos seemed afraid to act on the concerns of the u.s. 
 everybody was afraid of him mr. ingersoll says 
 mr. noriega became an even greater threat in N when u.s. intelligence services discovered that he had been buying <unk> of electronically monitored conversations from three <unk> working for the u.s. army 's <unk> military intelligence group 
 the tapes included <unk> of gen. torrijos 's own phone according to american intelligence officials 
 we caught him with his hands on our <unk> <unk> says former cia director <unk> turner 
 for the first time the u.s. considered cutting mr. noriega from its intelligence payroll and the deliberations were intense mr. turner says 
 in the world of intelligence if you want to get information you get it from <unk> characters 
 the question is how much you get tied in with <unk> characters so they can <unk> you 
 intelligence officials to this day worry whether mr. noriega sold sensitive information on the <unk> to the cubans or others 
 mr. turner was troubled enough to cancel the u.s. contract with the <unk> at the beginning of the carter administration 
 the u.s. soon found new cause for concern <unk> 
 prosecutors in southern florida indicted five <unk> on charges of illegally running arms to sandinista rebels trying to <unk> the nicaraguan government of mr. <unk> 
 they included one of mr. noriega 's <unk> friends and business partners carlos <unk> 
 and the investigators were quickly closing in on mr. noriega himself 
 at the time though in N the u.s. was once again <unk> with its longtime latin american spy 
 mr. noriega made plans to fly to washington for a meeting with his counterpart at the pentagon 
 <unk> county and federal authorities learning that he intended to fly through miami made plans to arrest him on the <unk> charges as soon as he hit u.s. soil 
 it was a friday in june 
 the pentagon <unk> the plan 
 according to military officers at the time word was passed to mr. noriega by his american hosts that the police would be waiting 
 on monday u.s. officials received a routine <unk> message from the military group <unk> in panama 
 due to health reasons <unk> col. noriega has elected to postpone his visit to washington it read 
 prosecutors in miami received yet another setback 
 their original indictment against mr. <unk> the friend of mr. noriega and the other four was dismissed on a <unk> 
 but now along with <unk> mr. noriega 's <unk> they intended to charge mr. noriega himself on allegations that he was involved in the illegal trading of some $ N million in arms 
 in january N jerome sanford as assistant u.s. attorney was summoned to a meeting with a federal bureau of investigation agent assigned to the bureau of alcohol tobacco and <unk> in miami 
 panamanian dictator torrijos he was told had granted the shah of iran <unk> in panama as a favor to washington 
 mr. sanford was told mr. noriega 's friend mr. <unk> would be handling the shah 's security 
 it would n't be a good idea to <unk> him much less mr. noriega the prosecutor was told 
 after <unk> from mr. sanford u.s. attorney jack <unk> pleaded with justice department officials in washington to let the indictment proceed 
 unfortunately mr. <unk> wrote in a letter those of us in law enforcement in miami find ourselves frequently attempting to enforce the laws of the united states but simultaneously being caught between foreign policy considerations over which we have no control 
 the letter along with a detailed prosecution memo sat on the desks of justice officials for months before the case died a quiet death 
 i think if we had been allowed to go ahead then we would n't have the problems we have now mr. sanford says 
 if he had been found guilty we could have stopped him 
 in august N mr. noriega took over as general and <unk> dictator of panama having <unk> his way to the top only two years after the <unk> death in a plane crash of his old boss <unk> torrijos 
 soon the military became a <unk> mafia controlling legal and illegal businesses 
 the reagan administration also put mr. noriega 's <unk> back on the u.s. payroll 
 payments averaged nearly $ N a year from the u.s. defense intelligence agency and the cia 
 although working for u.s. intelligence mr. noriega was hardly helping the u.s. exclusively 
 during the reagan years he expanded his business and intelligence contacts with the cubans and the sandinistas 
 he allegedly entered into panama 's first formal business arrangement with colombian drug bosses according to <unk> <unk> a pilot who once worked for mr. noriega and who testified before the u.s. grand jury in miami that would ultimately <unk> the panamanian on drug charges 
 but mr. noriega was convinced the reagan white house would n't act against him recalls his close ally jose <unk> because he had an insurance policy his involvement with the contra rebels in nicaragua 
 mr. <unk> says the general allowed the contras to set up a secret training center in panama 
 mr. noriega also <unk> intelligence from his spy operation inside the nicaraguan capital of managua 
 and on at least one occasion in the spring of N he helped arrange a sabotage attack on a sandinista <unk> in nicaragua 
 although his help for the contra cause was limited it was enough to win him important <unk> in the reagan administration says sen. patrick <unk> a vermont democrat who then served on the senate intelligence committee 
 noriega played u.s. intelligence agencies and the u.s. government like a violin he says 
 an incident in N suggested one additional means by which mr. noriega might have maintained such influence with washington by <unk> u.s. officials 
 <unk> windsor then the ambassador to costa rica recalls being invited to panama by mr. noriega 's brother luis carlos for a weekend of deep sea fishing and quiet serious conversation on the <unk> peninsula 
 mr. windsor notified <unk> e. briggs the u.s. ambassador to panama of the invitation 
 briggs <unk> mr. windsor recalls 
 he says mr. briggs told him he was being set up for a <unk> trap in which mr. noriega would try to involve him in an <unk> and then record the event with sound and video 
 mr. briggs on vacation after resigning his position at the national security council could n't be reached for comment 
 as mr. noriega 's political troubles grew so did his offers of assistance to the contras an apparent attempt to curry more favor in washington 
 for instance he helped steal the may N panamanian elections for the ruling party 
 but just one month later he also contributed $ N to a contra leader according to documents released for oliver north 's criminal trial in washington <unk> 
 yet his political setbacks mounted 
 mr. noriega was accused of ordering in N the <unk> of hugo <unk> his most outspoken political opponent and the first man to publicly finger mr. noriega on drug trafficking charges 
 he then ousted president nicholas <unk> <unk> a former world bank official with close ties to the u.s. after mr. <unk> tried to create a commission to investigate the murder 
 and all the while panama 's debt problems continued to grow 
 mr. noriega was growing desperate 
 in late N he made an offer he thought the u.s. could n't refuse 
 as <unk> in a <unk> that <unk> government documents released for the north trial mr. noriega offered to <unk> the sandinista leadership in exchange for a promise to help clean up noriega 's image and a commitment to lift the u.s. ban on military sales to the panamanian defense forces 
 north the document went on referring to oliver north has told noriega 's representative that u.s. law <unk> such actions 
 the representative responded that noriega had numerous assets in place in nicaragua and could accomplish many essential things just as noriega had helped the u.s. the previous year in <unk> up a sandinista <unk> 
 col. north <unk> the request to his <unk> and to assistant secretary of state <unk> abrams who <unk> it to secretary of state george <unk> 
 mr. noriega 's proposal was turned down 
 and mr. <unk> <unk> told mr. abrams that the general should be told that only he could repair his <unk> image 
 the end of the marriage was at hand 
 within weeks the <unk> iran-contra scandal took away mr. noriega 's insurance policy 
 the death of cia director william <unk> and resignation of oliver north allowed <unk> political forces to gain influence 
 public protests against him were triggered in june N due to charges by <unk> <unk> his former chief of staff that mr. noriega had stolen the N election and had ordered the killing of messrs. <unk> and torrijos 
 few american officials were willing any longer to defend him 
 lawyers in miami this time working virtually without <unk> prepared to have him indicted on drug charges in february N 
 during negotiations with american officials in may N over proposals to drop the u.s. <unk> in exchange for his resignation mr. noriega often asked almost <unk> how the americans whom he had helped for so many years could turn against him 
 now neither side the u.s. nor mr. noriega has an easy out 
 president bush has sworn to bring him to justice 
 mr. noriega believes he has n't any alternative but to continue <unk> to power 
 it is a <unk> battle perhaps to the death 
 in the end is mr. noriega the political equivalent of <unk> 's monster created by a <unk> but <unk> foreign power 
 not quite sen. <unk> contends 
 for short-term gains people were willing to put up with him 
 that allowed him to get stronger and stronger he says 
 i do n't think we created him as much as we fed him <unk> him and let him grow up to be big and strong

 yesterday 's edition provided analysts ' estimates for the company when actual earnings were available 
 industrial production declined N N in september reinforcing other signs that the manufacturing sector continues its slowing trend 
 the federal reserve board said output of the nation 's factories mines and utilities expanded at an annual rate of N N in the third quarter substantially slower than the N N annual rate in the second quarter 
 capital spending and exports which have been the driving force in this expansion are showing clear signs of having the steam taken out of them said robert <unk> economist for northern trust co. in chicago 
 the new reports of <unk> which were <unk> by an earlier labor department report that manufacturing <unk> dropped by N in september give the fed another reason to further ease its grip on credit and lower interest rates 
 they need to do something about this said <unk> harris economist at painewebber group inc 
 the fed also said u.s. industry operated at N N of capacity last month down from N N in august 
 measures of manufacturing activity fell more than the overall measures 
 factory output dropped N N its first decline since february after having been unchanged in october 
 factories operated at N N of capacity the lowest rate in more than a year and down from N N in september 
 the declines mainly reflected widespread weakness in durable goods those intended to last more than three years 
 the biggest drop was recorded by primary metals producers a category that includes the steel industry 
 output of business equipment was unchanged in september 
 production of factory equipment one indication of the strength of manufacturers ' investment spending fell N N 
 some economists expect further declines in investment spending 
 whenever corporate profits are weak that means capital spending is going to soften subsequently mr. harris said 
 you have n't seen the full effect of that yet 
 a decline in truck production more than offset a sharp rise in auto <unk> the fed noted

 lung-cancer mortality rates for people under N years of age have begun to decline federal researchers report 
 the drop is particularly large for white males although black males and white and black women also show lower mortality rates 
 a report in this week 's issue of the journal of the national cancer institute also projects that overall u.s. mortality rates from lung cancer the leading cause of cancer death should begin to drop in several years if cigarette smoking continues to <unk> 
 the report which comes N years after the u.s. surgeon general issued a report warning against the dangers of smoking is the strongest indication to date that the reduction in smoking is leading to lower death rates from lung cancer 
 what this is saying is that the surgeon general 's message is having an impact said <unk> <unk> an <unk> at the johns hopkins school of <unk> and public health in baltimore 
 the national cancer institute report compares mortality rates of two groups of people between the ages of N and N a decade apart 
 the death rate from lung cancer of white males aged N to N in the mid-1970s was N per N but the mortality rate of the same age group in the mid-1980s was N a decline of N N 
 measured the same way the decline for black males was N N 
 the drop in mortality rates for women was less steep N N for blacks and N N for whites 
 the study by susan <unk> william <unk> and joseph <unk> of the institute 's staff also shows that the <unk> of lung cancer as well as the death rate declined over the decade for all groups in the N age <unk> except black men 
 although lung-cancer mortality rates are increasing for the nation as a whole the report projects that death rates will begin to decline in the 1990s for men and after the year N for women 
 lung-cancer mortality rates increase with age and are continuing to rise for all age groups over N with sharp increases for everybody but white men 
 but dr. <unk> one of the authors of the report said the declining rates we 're seeing for younger people we believe may be a <unk> of declining mortality in the future 
 however he stressed that the improvement depends on a continued reduction in smoking 
 even though these favorable trends in lung-cancer mortality affect all sex and race groups they ca n't be taken for granted the report says 
 smoking prevention programs should reach larger segments of the population especially children <unk> and minorities 
 an editorial in the <unk> journal says the report of declining lung-cancer mortality among young men and women in the u.s. indicates that we finally may be winning the battle this even in a country where the tobacco industry spends over $ N billion a year for promotion of the <unk> habit of smoking 
 but the editorial by jan <unk> of the world health organization notes that tobacco consumption and lung-cancer mortality rates are rising in developing countries 
 <unk> should be established as the <unk> of social behavior around the world the editorial says through the enactment of laws that limit advertising boost tobacco prices and promote <unk> education 
 asked for comment walker <unk> a vice president of the tobacco institute said new efforts to restrict tobacco advertising in the u.s. could violate the first amendment protection of free speech 
 according to the american cancer society smoking is responsible for N N of the lung-cancer cases among men and N N among women 
 the <unk> report attributes the differences in mortality rates by race to different smoking patterns 
 a higher proportion of black men smoke than white men 
 while nearly equal <unk> of black and white women currently smoke in both <unk> more whites have given up smoking than blacks

 this is written to correct a <unk> in your oct. N article deaths from advanced colon cancer can be reduced by using two drugs 
 in this article i was alleged to have said any patient with high-risk colon cancer is really getting short <unk> if he 's not getting this therapy 
 i did n't say this and i 'm totally opposed to the philosophy expressed by the quote 
 i have not offered and will not offer routine therapy with the two drugs <unk> and <unk> to any of my <unk> patients 
 with this treatment we have reduced deaths in high-risk colon cancer by one-third but this leaves the two-thirds who are dying of cancer 
 this is not nearly good enough 
 i believe any physician who truly <unk> about cancer patients both today and tomorrow should offer the hope of something better than that 
 my statement read <unk> from a printed text available to all reporters attending the national cancer institute news conference was the following new clinical trials are already in operation seeking to improve these results 
 these research <unk> offer to the patient not only the very best therapy which we have established today but also the hope of something still better 
 i feel any patient with high-risk cancer is getting short <unk> if he is not offered this opportunity 
 we have very exciting prospects for far more impressive advances in the treatment of colon cancer during the years immediately ahead 
 this hope however will never be realized if we use <unk> and <unk> as a <unk> point

 the oil and auto industries united in their dislike of president bush 's proposal for cars that run on alternative fuels announced a joint research program that could turn up a <unk> gasoline 
 officials of the big three auto makers and N petroleum companies said they are setting out to find the most <unk> fuel for reducing cities ' <unk> problems with no bias toward any fuel in particular 
 however their search notably wo n't include natural gas or pure <unk> the two <unk> alternative fuels in tests to be completed by next summer 
 instead the tests will focus heavily on new <unk> of gasoline which are still undeveloped but which the petroleum industry has been touting as a solution for automobile pollution that is <unk> urban areas 
 environmentalists criticized the program as merely a public-relations attempt to head off a white house proposal to require a million cars a year that run on <unk> fuels by N 
 while major oil companies have been <unk> with <unk> gasoline <unk> for years only atlantic richfield co. is now marketing a <unk> gasoline for older cars currently running on <unk> fuel

 william seidman chairman of the federal deposit insurance corp. said lincoln savings & loan association should have been seized by the government in N to contain losses that he estimated will cost taxpayers as much as $ N billion 
 mr. seidman who has been the nation 's top bank regulator inherited the problems of lincoln based in irvine calif. after his regulatory role was expanded by the new savings-and-loan bailout law 
 he made his comments before house banking committee hearings to investigate what appears to be the biggest thrift disaster in a <unk> industry 
 the inquiry also will cover the actions of charles keating jr. who is chairman of american continental corp. lincoln 's parent and who contributed heavily to several u.s. senators 
 mr. seidman told the committee that the resolution trust corp. the agency created to sell sick thrifts has studied lincoln 's examination reports by former regulators dating back to N 
 my staff indicated that had we made such findings in one of our own institutions we would have sought an immediate <unk> order to stop the hazardous operations mr. seidman said 
 when lincoln was seized by the government for example N N of its loans or $ N million were to borrowers who were buying real estate from one of american continental 's N other subsidiaries according to mr. seidman 
 but the government did n't step in until six months ago when thrift officials put lincoln into conservatorship the day after american continental filed for chapter N bankruptcy protection from creditors 
 the bankruptcy filing the government has charged in a $ N billion civil lawsuit was part of a pattern to shift insured deposits to the parent company which used the deposits as a <unk> for real-estate deals 
 the deposits that have been transferred to other subsidiaries are now under the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court 
 i think it 's fairly clear mr. keating knew that regulators were set to seize lincoln mr. seidman said 
 further investigation he said may result in further actions against lincoln 's executives said mr. seidman including fraud actions 
 mr. keating for his part has filed suit alleging that regulators <unk> seized the thrift 
 leonard <unk> an attorney in washington for mr. keating declined to comment on the hearings except to say we will be responding <unk> in several <unk> to each of these allegations at the appropriate time 
 lincoln 's treatment by former thrift regulators in an agency <unk> by the new law has proved embarrassing for five senators who received thousands of dollars in campaign contributions from mr. keating 
 mr. seidman said yesterday for example that sen. dennis <unk> d. ariz. who received $ N in contributions from mr. keating <unk> mr. seidman to request that he push for a sale of lincoln before it would be seized 
 after the government lawsuit was filed against lincoln sen. <unk> returned the campaign contributions 
 the senator 's spokesman said yesterday that he pushed for the sale of lincoln because hundreds of arizona jobs at lincoln were on the line 
 senate banking committee chairman donald <unk> d. mich has also returned contributions he received from mr. keating a year ago 
 sens. john glenn d. ohio john <unk> r. ariz. and alan cranston d. calif. also received substantial contributions from mr. keating and sought to intervene on behalf of lincoln 
 house banking committee chairman henry gonzalez d. texas said sen. cranston <unk> to appear before the house committee if necessary 
 but a committee staff member said the panel is unlikely to pursue closely the role of the senators 
 at the hearing mr. seidman said the rtc has already pumped $ N million into lincoln for liquidity 
 he also held out little hope of <unk> for purchasers of $ N million in american continental subordinated debt 
 some of those <unk> have filed a suit saying they believed they were buying <unk> certificates of deposit 
 we have no plans at this time to pay off those notes he said 
 eastern airlines ' creditors committee unhappy with the carrier 's plans for emerging from bankruptcy-law proceedings asked its own experts to devise <unk> approaches to a reorganization 
 representatives of the accounting firm of ernst & young and the securities firm of goldman sachs & co. hired by creditors to <unk> on eastern 's financial plans told the committee in a private meeting yesterday that eastern 's latest plan to emerge from bankruptcy-law protection is far riskier than an earlier one which won the creditors ' approval 
 according to one person present at the meeting eastern 's new plan is financially overly optimistic 
 asked about the consultants ' reports an eastern spokeswoman said we totally disagree 
 she said they have <unk> and made some <unk> assumptions that make their analysis completely <unk> 
 at a later news conference here frank lorenzo chairman of eastern 's parent texas air corp. said eastern was exceeding its goals for getting back into operation and predicted it would emerge from chapter N protection from creditors early next year operating with more service than it originally had scheduled 
 he insisted as he has before that creditors would be paid in full under the plan 
 mr. lorenzo made no mention of creditors ' negative response to his plan 
 we 're in the process of discussing an amended plan with the creditors and anticipate filing that amended plan shortly mr. lorenzo told reporters 
 we 're meeting and <unk> our goals he added 
 in july eastern and its creditors agreed on a reorganization plan that called for eastern to sell $ N billion in assets and to emerge from bankruptcy-law protection at two-thirds its former size 
 but after selling off pieces such as its east coast shuttle its philadelphia hub and various planes eastern hit a <unk> block 
 it could n't sell its south american routes one of the major assets marked for disposal 
 those routes valued by the creditors ' professionals at about $ N million were to be sold to amr corp. 's american airlines 
 a last-minute <unk> in negotiations with amr over an unrelated lawsuit between american and another texas air unit caused the deal to collapse 
 eastern ultimately decided it would have to keep and operate the routes itself which would leave it with less cash for its reorganization 
 it also would leave eastern a bigger carrier than the <unk> one proposed under the initial plan 
 those changes in its condition meant the reorganization plan previously presented to creditors would have to be revamped 
 since then eastern has been negotiating with creditors over revisions but the creditors committee has been having problems with the revisions 
 the committee has two groups of experts it calls on to analyze eastern 's plans 
 both said the new plan would n't work 
 ernst & young said eastern 's plans will miss its projections of earnings before interest tax and depreciation by $ N million and that eastern 's plan presented no comfort level according to a source present at yesterday 's session 
 experts from goldman sachs estimated eastern would miss the same mark by $ N million to $ N million the source said 
 the experts said they expected eastern would have to issue new debt to cover its costs and that it would generate far less cash than anticipated 
 other costs also would increase including maintenance because eastern has an older fleet 
 at the news conference mr. lorenzo and eastern president phil <unk> presented a far <unk> assessment 
 <unk> by flight attendants pilots and gate agents dressed in <unk> new blue <unk> they said eastern has exceeded its operational goals and is filling its seats 
 starting next month eastern will begin flying N flights daily instead of the previously announced N they said 
 mr. <unk> declined to give out eastern 's daily losses but said he did n't expect eastern would have to dip into the cash from asset sales currently held in escrow 
 these accounts hold several hundred million dollars primarily from asset sales 
 the plan eastern hopes to pursue he said calls for eastern to have $ N million in cash by year 's end 
 both he and mr. lorenzo predicted that plan might be confirmed in january 
 as to negotiations with creditors mr. lorenzo said in remarks after the conference we 'll have to see how they talks come along 
 however he added it 's not a requirement that the plan be accepted by creditors 
 it must be accepted by the court 
 under bankruptcy law eastern has exclusive rights for a certain period to develop its own reorganization plan 
 that deadline has been extended once and could be extended again 
 if eastern can get creditor support court confirmation of its plan could be relatively swift 
 but creditors are free to press for court approval of their own plan or the court could ignore both sides and draw its own 
 in any event some people familiar with the case question whether the court will act by january as forecast by mr. lorenzo and mr. <unk> 
 eastern sought bankruptcy-law protection a few days after a <unk> strike began march N 
 mr. lorenzo told reporters the reorganization eastern is pursuing would create a carrier N N to N N of the size of the <unk> eastern 
 he projected it would be operating about N flights a day by late spring only slightly fewer than the carrier 's old volume of N a day 
 hopes of <unk> the corporate minimum tax before N are weakening

 this summer speeding bikers were blamed for an accident in the <unk> county park in which a horse spooked on a trail that was closed to bikers broke its leg 
 the animal had to be destroyed the bikers fled and were never found 
 in numerous parks near san francisco <unk> have been forced to close trails set up speed <unk> and use radar guns to curb fast and reckless riding 
 they have even sent <unk> in pursuit of bikers after <unk> and <unk> complained they were being driven from trails 
 we were being <unk> says steve <unk> trails coordinator of the east bay regional park district 
 two years ago the district decided to limit the bikes to fire roads in its N <unk> acres 
 from about N six years ago the number of mountain bikes in the u.s. is expected to grow to N million in N 
 at least half that growth will have come in the past three years alone 
 the controversy kicked up by the proliferation of these <unk> <unk> is one of the most divisive <unk> to blow through the national conservation movement in recent memory 
 bikers many of them <unk> environmentalists <unk> their sport an efficient safe <unk> way to get back to nature while <unk> a right as taxpayers to <unk> on public <unk> 
 but the bikes ' <unk> numbers safety concerns and fear that they damage fragile <unk> have prompted <unk> from the <unk> to the eastern <unk> to ban them from the back country 
 key to the issue is that the bikes in <unk> hands can go virtually anywhere and in reckless hands can become vehicles of <unk> 
 an <unk> <unk> can leap from a dead stop to the top of a <unk> table without losing balance 
 such skills allow riders to fly down <unk> mountain grades at speeds of up to N miles an hour a <unk> for the <unk> but a nightmare for <unk> <unk> or <unk> 
 for <unk> <unk> managers across the nation the response is increasingly to shut the gates 
 the state of california following the lead of some regional parks recently adopted regulations that closed nearly all <unk> <unk> in state parks to mountain <unk> 
 the move largely <unk> them to roads used by <unk> vehicles 
 most other states have enacted similar bans 
 the bikes are unwelcome on trails in national parks 
 even the u.s. forest service whose <unk> <unk> philosophy permits <unk> vehicles on thousands of miles of its trails across the u.s. has begun to close some <unk> to the bikes including major portions of the popular pacific crest trail which <unk> from california to canada 
 often these closings come after vigorous <unk> lobbying by conservation organizations the politically potent sierra club among them 
 sierra has been instrumental in <unk> a number of the california bans 
 it has been <unk> an <unk> campaign to beat back a proposal pushed by utah bike groups to allow the cycles in federally designated <unk> areas where they are now prohibited 
 yet sierra 's hard-line stance has created something of a <unk> in the organization which estimates that N N of its N members own mountain bikes 
 pressure from these members prompted the club recently to soften its <unk> rhetoric it no longer for example <unk> the bikes into the same category as <unk> and other <unk> <unk> vehicles 
 but the club still insists that public <unk> ought to be closed to the bikes unless studies indicate the bikes wo n't <unk> the environment or other users

 he says fellow bikers show the same concern for the land that they demonstrated as <unk> many are <unk> that the conservation community would suddenly consider them the enemy 
 to fight back activists such as mr. <unk> are forming groups to lobby land managers over access issues and <unk> education programs to show that the bikes can <unk> share trails

 <unk> groups in <unk> idaho michigan and massachusetts have won similar concessions says tim <unk> mountain bike editor of <unk> magazine 
 these groups have been trying to improve the mountain <unk> 's image in the san <unk> park district where a <unk> was clobbered by a <unk> this summer bikers have formed a volunteer <unk> to help <unk> enforce regulations and to school riders in proper trail <unk> 
 even <unk> <unk> sierra members concede that N N of all riders cause most of the problems 
 while some are <unk> riders who simply <unk> regulations much bad riding simply reflects ignorance that can be corrected through education and <unk> pressure says jim <unk> a director of the international mountain <unk> association

 some competing forest-products firms have recently reported improved results due to strong pulp and paper business

 the bank also said it expects to report a $ N billion loss for the third quarter and a loss for the full year 
 the new reserves bring the company 's provision for loans to third world countries to $ N billion or N N of bankers trust 's medium and long-term loans to these countries 
 step up to the plate and take the big swing 
 get the problem behind you and do n't look back said james j. <unk> analyst at <unk> <unk> & woods in <unk> of the move 
 bankers trust has had the capacity to do this for some time the analyst said 
 he expects citicorp to take a similar step this year 
 citicorp yesterday reported a N N third-quarter earnings drop which analysts called a bit disappointing while manufacturers hanover corp. posted a $ N million loss for the quarter after adding $ N million to its reserve for loans to less-developed countries 
 three other major u.s. banks posted earnings increases 
 wells fargo & co. of san francisco posted a N N jump 
 <unk> financial corp. the parent of pittsburgh national bank reported net income climbed N N while net for banc one corp. of columbus ohio grew N N

 the cross-border loan portfolio reflected adjustment problems and <unk> payment patterns the bank said no interest payments from argentina in the nine months and none from brazil in the third quarter while venezuela brought itself substantially current 
 overall the portfolio narrowed its quarterly loss to $ N million from $ N million a year earlier 
 people were waiting to see if we would take an additional provision for <unk> and long-term loans to less-developed countries a citicorp spokesman said 
 but he reiterated the bank 's position that it is comfortable with the current level of $ N billion covering about N N of the $ N billion of such loans outstanding 
 ronald i. <unk> analyst at sanford c. bernstein & co. called citicorp 's venture-capital gains of $ N million before taxes strong 
 a concerning item the analyst cited was the N N jump in expenses which the bank attributes to costs of expanding both its consumer credit-card operations and its overseas branch business 
 citicorp 's spokesman said however that the bank is maintaining those expenses in proportion to revenue growth 
 wells fargo 
 wells fargo continued to generate one of the highest profit margins among major banks <unk> a drop in net interest margin with N N third-quarter growth in <unk> business loans and similar growth in mortgages 
 its margin fell only seven basis points or <unk> of a percentage point from a year ago compared with a <unk> drop at security pacific corp. and much larger declines among banks in other parts of the country 
 as a result wells fargo 's net interest income rose $ N million or N N to $ N million for the quarter 
 non-interest income fell slightly to $ N million from $ N million while wells fargo continued to <unk> control non-interest expense which was almost flat at $ N million 
 the combination of solid loan growth with tight expense control gave wells fargo a N N return on average assets for the quarter about N N higher than security pacific 's and a profit ratio matched by only two or three other major banks in the u.s. 
 wells fargo 's return on equity increased to N N from N N 
 wells fargo has sold all of its <unk> loans made to less-developed countries and managed to partly reverse the sharp rise in domestic <unk> loans which fell N N from the previous quarter to $ N million from $ N million 
 but the amount was still N N higher than the year-ago level and N N higher as a percentage of total loans 
 that trend and wells fargo 's heavy exposure to leveraged buy-outs are about the only worries analysts have about wells fargo 's financial picture

 prime minister <unk> gandhi set a date next month for general elections that some analysts say could cost him and his ruling congress i party control of the government 
 other analysts say the indian leader could retain control with a slim majority or be forced to rule as the dominant partner in a coalition with other parties 
 elections in this large diverse and <unk> nation are always hard to predict 
 much depends on the opposition a loose group of regional and ideological parties led by former gandhi cabinet minister <unk> <unk> <unk> 
 the biggest <unk> is that the elections will be a vote for or against mr. gandhi and his five years in power five years of ups and <unk> promises and disappointments and wide fluctuations in popularity 
 yesterday four days after an unusual parliamentary defeat for the ruling party mr. gandhi called elections for the lower house of parliament on nov. N and N 
 the elections will be held in different states on one of the two days 
 the lower house 's five-year term expires in january the parliament 's upper house is appointed 
 the elections will be a <unk> test for the 45-year-old prime minister and congress i which in various forms has ruled for N of india 's N years of independence 
 after a <unk> win in N in polls held after the assassination of his mother <unk> gandhi mr. gandhi saw his popularity begin a roller <unk> ride 
 his early promises to make india a modern nation remain <unk> down in bloated bureaucracy 
 his pledge to clean up local administration and indian politics including his own party went <unk> 
 his mr. clean image was <unk> by an <unk> scandal which will be a major campaign issue 
 some analysts predict that disappointment in mr. gandhi 's spent pledge to reduce corruption and <unk> local government will crest at the polls 
 there 's a wide feeling of <unk> across the country says <unk> sen <unk> of the center for policy research in new <unk> 
 i think the people will be judging the regime by a <unk> <unk> by a corrupt revenue <unk> 
 this could be a big protest against an administrative failure 
 even if the congress i retains control of the government mr. gandhi 's ability to push through major initiatives might be <unk> by a <unk> majority 
 economic analysts call his <unk> <unk> of the indian economy incomplete and many are hoping for major new <unk> if he is returned firmly to power 
 the <unk> <unk> or lower house of parliament has N elected and two appointed seats 
 in N the congress i captured N seats the largest victory in the history of indian democracy 
 the <unk> was fueled by panic that prevailed in india at the time 
 mrs. gandhi had been <unk> by <unk> <unk> and many indians feared their country might split apart 
 in the previous three general elections similar national issues <unk> the vote 
 in N the congress party won after india 's victory in the <unk> war 
 in N mrs. gandhi was thrown out of office after her <unk> emergency rule and in N after her <unk> made a mess of their three years in power she was restored to office 
 most political analysts say that if mr. gandhi 's opposition <unk> to field single candidates in most <unk> the congress i will lose big 
 but if the opposition remains <unk> the congress i could win a small majority or lead a coalition government 
 <unk> mehta a <unk> and former gandhi ally predicts congress i will win only N seats a quarter of the house if the opposition fields single candidates in N N of the races 
 analysts say the opposition will struggle this week to <unk> and its success will be clear only when it <unk> its final list of parliamentary candidates 
 the <unk> scandal is likely to be one of the big talking points in the campaign but it 's unclear how it is viewed by average indian voters 
 in N india signed a $ N billion contract with ab bofors a unit of nobel industries sweden ab to purchase N <unk> pieces 
 the contract was negotiated by the countries ' two prime ministers and was supposed to be free of commissions or agents ' costs 
 in april N evidence surfaced that commissions were paid 
 the opposition charged that the money was used to bribe indian government officials an <unk> denied by mr. gandhi 's administration 
 but many of his statements on the issue in parliament subsequently were proven wrong by <unk> evidence 
 the scandal has faded and <unk> but recent disclosures propelled it back onto the front pages and that has helped <unk> the opposition which last week blocked passage of two constitutional amendment bills 
 it was the first time in N years that such government bills were defeated 
 in a country where a bribe is needed to get a phone a job and even into a school the name bofors has become a potent <unk> cry against the government 
 that illustrates the kind of disappointment many indians feel toward mr. gandhi whom they <unk> elected and <unk> supported in his first two years in power 
 his term has produced no spectacular failures in politics in the economy or on the military front and has <unk> up some successes 
 but the average indian had tremendous hope in the <unk> leader and his promise to make both government and the ruling party more effective and less corrupt 
 his failures in those two areas deeply and sometimes bitterly disappointed many indians 
 we do n't like the congress i says <unk> <unk> a farmer in the western state of <unk> 
 the congress government is taking the farmers ' bread and not giving us any support 
 when there are well problems light problems road problems the government tells us to forget it 
 the greatest thing going for mr. gandhi and the congress i party is the poor reputation of the opposition 
 even if it <unk> for the elections its <unk> is likely to be temporary 
 when the congress i lost the N election following mrs. gandhi 's <unk> emergency rule a similar coalition took power and then <unk> 
 many indians fear a repeat of that experience

 the <unk> trading relationship between bonds and stocks was interrupted yesterday as bonds fell despite a modest decline in stock prices 
 but bond investors continue to keep a close watch on the jittery stock market 
 in early trading investors were bidding bond prices higher as stocks tumbled and fears mounted that friday 's stock market debacle would be repeated 
 but a partial recovery in the dow jones industrial average which had been down more than N points in midmorning dashed those expectations 
 treasury bonds also were hurt late in the day by a $ N billion offering by the tennessee valley authority and the prospect of a huge amount of new agency debt 
 bond investors were hoping that stock prices would continue to fall said roger early a vice president at federated investors inc. pittsburgh 
 when stocks stabilized that was a disappointment 
 meanwhile for the second straight day the bond market paid little attention to the federal reserve 's open market operations 
 fed officials <unk> more cash into the banking system by arranging $ N billion of repurchase agreements during the usual <unk> intervention period 
 the move was meant to keep a lid on interest rates and to boost investor confidence 
 the intervention has been friendly meaning that they really did n't have to do it said maria <unk> ramirez money-market economist at drexel burnham lambert inc 
 she said a more aggressive move was n't needed 
 the fed also appears reluctant to ease credit conditions further 
 it already has allowed the closely watched federal funds rate to decline N percentage point to about N N N from its previous target level of about N N 
 the rate which banks charge each other on overnight loans is considered an early signal of changes in fed policy 
 it ended at about N N N yesterday but was as low as N N N monday 
 the treasury 's benchmark 30-year bond fell more than N point or over $ N for each $ N face amount while the yield moved above N N for the first time since thursday

 the macy 's issue closed up about one point at a bid price of N 
 the tva 's public debt offering was its first in N years 
 strong investor demand prompted it to boost the size of the issue from $ N billion

 underwriters of the tva bonds reduced their market risk by selling treasurys to cover at least part of their tva holdings said james r. <unk> a senior vice president at shearson lehman government securities inc 
 the tva bonds also served to <unk> the market that there will be even more new supply said lawrence n. <unk> a managing director at <unk> warburg securities & co 
 today the treasury will announce the size of its next two-year note sale and resolution funding corp. will announce details of its first bond offering

 the tva which operates one of the nation 's largest electric power systems is a corporation wholly owned by the u.s. government 
 yesterday 's bond sale was part of a $ N billion refinancing plan to pay off high-interest debt the tva owes the federal financing bank an arm of the treasury 
 meanwhile lockheed corp. priced a $ N million note offering to yield N N 
 mortgage-backed securities 
 the derivative mortgage-backed market revived after a brief <unk> as two new remics totaling $ N million were offered and talk circulated about two more issues that could be priced today 
 the revival of the real estate mortgage investment <unk> market reflected the relative calm in the mortgage market after two days of volatile trading 
 dealers noted that it 's difficult to structure new remics when prices are moving widely 
 the two remics priced were a $ N million federal home loan mortgage corp. issue underwritten by salomon brothers inc. and a $ N million federal national mortgage association deal underwritten by greenwich capital markets 
 the remic issuance supported prices of freddie mac and fannie mae securities which held up better than government national mortgage association securities during an afternoon sell-off

 a house-senate conference approved an estimated $ N billion fiscal N spending bill that provides a N N increase for space research and development and <unk> far-reaching provisions affecting the federal mortgage market 
 the current ceiling on home loans insured by the federal housing administration would be increased to $ N 
 separately the bill gives authority to the bush administration to facilitate the refinancing of federally subsidized loans for low-income and <unk> homeowners 
 the second provision affecting so-called N mortgages has met strong opposition from investment bankers represented by the public securities association 
 and a <unk> of influential former senate aides employed by the wall street firm salomon brothers came to the capitol in a <unk> attempt to strip the provision 
 by an N margin senate negotiators voted to preserve the N mortgage refinancing plan and despite powerful allies the opposition found itself undercut by an unusual alliance of liberals and conservatives 
 the government currently is subsidizing an estimated N loans above N N under the N program and however <unk> to private investors the refinancing is expected to yield at least $ N million in savings in fiscal N 
 this sum has been <unk> <unk> by <unk> anxious to offset spending elsewhere and conservative sen. phil <unk> cast the fight as a <unk> stand against <unk> interests 
 we are <unk> here not of the mortgage companies but the taxpayers said the texas republican 
 the action came as the administration won final congressional approval of $ N million in assistance for elections scheduled in nicaragua in february 
 the bulk of the money would be <unk> through the national <unk> for democracy but the legislation is so <unk> written that it has been dogged by questions regarding the money 's true purpose and its ultimate <unk> 
 the senate had refused late friday to <unk> <unk> and limit debate but behind the bipartisan leadership a solid majority took shape yesterday and brushed aside amendments seeking to cut the total package or steer it away from direct aid to political parties 
 final approval on a N roll call was never in doubt but the opposition drew an unusual mix of senators including republicans <unk> <unk> and warren <unk> and democrats bill bradley and john glenn 
 the money will be applied for voter registration and election monitoring but more than half is likely to go to the union <unk> <unk> party 
 critics warned such cash contributions may only undercut the opposition party 's standing and one irony is that under nicaraguan law a major portion of the opposition party 's funds must be shared with the government 's supreme electoral council 
 within the appropriations conference yesterday the $ N billion measure is the second largest of the annual domestic spending bills and covers a <unk> collection of accounts for science housing veterans and the environment 
 the decision to raise the ceiling on fha home loans still faces strong opposition in the house 
 but it is driven by the same fiscal pressures that have forced lawmakers to resort to various <unk> devices to <unk> as much as $ N billion in spending that would otherwise put the bill over budget 
 these costs will complicate the budget picture in fiscal N and the measure further <unk> congress to a set of costly projects including the first construction funds for the space station 
 the station is promised $ N billion within the $ N billion provided for research and development in the national aeronautics and space administration and the nation 's <unk> aerospace plane cut by the senate could receive as much as $ N million in new funds or transfers 
 similarly the house agreed to add back $ N million to continue work on the advanced communications technology satellite being developed by general electric co 
 and while setting a statutory limit of $ N billion on the automated space probe the conference appropriated $ N million for the start-up of the <unk> mission a successor to the <unk> space probe 
 among major domestic agencies the environmental protection agency stands to receive increases significantly beyond those sought by the administration with pollution <unk> and control accounts growing by N N to about $ N million 
 an estimated $ N billion is separately allocated for the national science foundation and within the housing and urban development department more than $ N billion is provided for federally <unk> housing including an expanded effort to modernize public housing units that serve the poorest families 
 to an unusual degree the massive bill has become a vehicle for lawmakers to <unk> funds for projects in home states 
 while the practice was discouraged in the past the conference agreement is <unk> with veterans ' hospitals environmental projects and urban grants designated for specific communities 
 the most striking example yesterday may have been in community development funds where the two houses had separately approved a total of N projects valued at $ N million and the conference added N more valued at $ N million to <unk> preserve balance between the house and senate 
 yesterday 's conference agreement is the second major bill to emerge from negotiations this week as <unk> approved a fiscal N transportation bill late monday that includes a sweeping ban on smoking on most domestic airline flights 
 an exemption will remain for flights longer than six hours to hawaii and alaska but estimates by the tobacco industry yesterday indicate all but about N flights would be covered 
 separately a third conference report covering an $ N billion treasury and postal service bill was sent to the senate after passing the house on a N roll call yesterday 
 and after weeks of delay the appropriations process is beginning to take some final shape 
 defense and foreign aid are the two most critical areas remaining from the administration 's standpoint 
 and among domestic programs the most serious threat is white house opposition to abortion riders attached to separate bills funding the district of columbia and department of health and human services 
 the same issue threatens to spill over to the foreign aid debate and mr. bush also is threatening to veto any agreement that <unk> <unk> provisions renewing u.s. support for the united nations fund for population activities 
 in a sharply written letter rep. david <unk> chairman of the house appropriations subcommittee for foreign operations warned mr. bush that the result of his <unk> could weaken efforts to accommodate the administration elsewhere 
 as a result of your <unk> writes the wisconsin democrat i guess there is no longer any point in taking administration views into account on other items in conference <unk> regardless of their resolution you apparently intend to veto this bill 
 markets usually get noticed because they soar or plunge 
 gold which has n't risen or fallen significantly in quite some time yesterday achieved what may be a new level of <unk> the most actively traded futures contracts closed unchanged despite nervous fluctuations in both the dollar and the stock market 
 the settlement prices of the december february and april gold contracts were even with monday 's final prices 
 the december N contract which has the greatest trading volume ended at $ N an ounce 
 the other months posted advances of N cents to N cents an ounce 
 according to one analyst bernard savaiko of painewebber new york the stock market 's ability on monday to rally from last friday 's decline which seemed to indicate that the economy was n't going to fall either took the <unk> out of precious metals prices and out of gold 's in particular 
 yesterday gold traded within a narrow range 
 gold tried to rally on monday but ran into the same situation that has subdued gold prices for more than a year selling by gold producers who want to fix the highest possible price for their gold 
 december delivery gold is trading in a range of $ N to $ N an ounce and is having difficulty breaking out above that mr. savaiko said 
 producers at the moment regard that area a good one in which to sell gold 
 also mr. savaiko noted stock market investors seeking greater safety are <unk> toward buying bonds rather than precious metals because we are <unk> more toward a <unk> economy that does n't make gold and precious metals attractive 
 jeffrey <unk> president of <unk> canada toronto precious metals advisers said there is little to <unk> gold traders to buy the metal 
 investors in the u.s. and europe are comfortable with the actions of the federal reserve in its willingness to supply liquidity to financial system which helped the stock market rebound on monday he said 
 there is n't any rush on the part of investors in the west to buy gold he said 
 they still bear the memory of october N when they bought gold after the stock market <unk> and ended up losing money because gold prices subsequently fell mr. <unk> said 
 it 's an experience they do n't want to repeat 
 at the moment gold traders are n't concerned about inflation he said and as for the dollar gold 's association with the currency has been <unk> recently so drops in the currency are n't having much impact on gold 
 <unk> mehta chief bullion trader for chase manhattan bank said there is little incentive on the part of traders to sell gold because the stock market may go lower and gold may retain some of its flight to safety quality 
 there is little incentive to buy gold because if the stock market goes higher it may be just a false alarm 
 this is keeping the gold traders <unk> 
 the most remarkable feature about yesterday 's action was that the price of roughly $ N an ounce was regarded as attractive enough by gold producers around the world to aggressively sell gold mr. mehta said 
 i do n't know what it means over the long run but for the short term it appears that gold producers are <unk> for the $ N or so that gold has risen over the past week or so he said 
 previously he noted gold producers <unk> to back off from a rising gold market letting prices rise as much as possible before selling 
 mr. mehta observed that the u.s. merchandise trade deficit which rose sharply in august according to yesterday 's report has been having less and less impact on the gold market 
 the dollar has n't reacted much to it so gold has n't either he said 
 in other commodity markets yesterday

 the march contract advanced N cent a pound to N cents 
 according to an analyst cuba ca n't meet all its shipment commitments and has asked japan to accept a delay of shipments scheduled for later this year into early next year 
 japan is perceived as a wealthy nation that can turn elsewhere in the world market and buy the sugar the analyst said 
 it was the possibility of this demand that helped firm prices the analyst said 
 another analyst noted that cuba has been deferring shipments in recent years 
 to the professionals in the trade it did n't cause much surprise 
 the march futures contract traded as high as N cents but could n't sustain the advance he said 
 livestock and <unk> 
 the prices of cattle <unk> and pork <unk> futures contracts rebounded as livestock traders shook off fears that the friday stock market plunge would <unk> consumer spending which in turn would hurt retail sales of beef and pork 
 the prices of most livestock futures contracts had dropped sharply monday 
 cattle futures prices were also supported yesterday by signs that supermarket chains are making plans to increase their promotions concerning beef 
 grains and soybeans 
 the prices of most soybean and <unk> futures contracts rose amid rumors that the soviet union is interested in buying from the u.s. or south america about N metric tons of soybeans and as many as N metric tons of soybean <unk> 
 traders are especially sensitive to reports of possible u.s. soybean sales because u.s. exports are lagging 
 since sept. N about N million fewer <unk> of u.s. soybeans have been sold overseas than for the same period last year 
 corn futures prices rose slightly while wheat prices settled mixed

 health benefits remain a central lobbying effort even as section N <unk> 
 the senate after <unk> section N repeal from its deficit-reduction bill still is expected to join the house in voting to kill the law which forces companies to provide comparable benefits to <unk> and executives alike 
 in lobbying on other <unk> topics the national federation of independent business will press for legislation that would give self-employed people a N N tax deduction for their own health plans up from N N currently 
 and the group will urge that the federal government <unk> state rules on what must be covered by employers ' health insurance 
 small-business groups also will fight the <unk> provision of legislation that would expand parental leaves 
 and they still oppose as too costly an <unk> health insurance bill sponsored by sen. edward kennedy d. mass despite his proposal to phase in small business only gradually 
 there is also worry that the <unk> commission studying long-term health care will again push lawmakers toward <unk> solutions 
 the section N victory could have a downside by making it harder to oppose lawmakers on other health proposals 
 with the repeal of section N we can no longer say they 're discouraging businesses from offering health plans says <unk> russell the chamber of commerce 's small-business advocate

 but the warranty on simpler parts would be lowered to two years or N miles 
 the garage owners say they would benefit because car owners would be less likely to go back to dealers for the simpler repairs after two years 
 the repair shops are n't united however 
 shops represented by the automotive service industry association and the motor equipment manufacturers association oppose any increase in warranty length

 when the soviets announced their last <unk> had left afghanistan in february the voices of skepticism were all but <unk> out by an international chorus of euphoria 
 it was the soviets ' vietnam 
 the kabul regime would fall 
 millions of refugees would rush home 
 a resistance government would walk into kabul 
 those who bought that illusion are now <unk> 
 eight months after gen. <unk> <unk> walked across the bridge into the u.s.s.r. a <unk> regime remains in kabul the refugees sit in their camps and the restoration of afghan freedom seems as far off as ever 
 but there never was a chance that the afghan resistance would <unk> the kabul regime quickly and easily 
 soviet leaders said they would support their kabul clients by all means necessary and did 
 the u.s. said it would fully support the resistance and did n't 
 with the february N u.n. accords relating to afghanistan the soviet union got everything it needed to consolidate permanent control 
 the terms of the geneva accords leave moscow free to provide its clients in kabul with assistance of any kind including the return of soviet ground forces while requiring the u.s. and pakistan to cut off aid 
 the only fly in the soviet <unk> was the last-minute addition of a <unk> american <unk> that u.s. aid to the resistance would continue as long as soviet aid to kabul did 
 but as soon as the accords were signed american officials sharply reduced aid 
 in february N when the soviets said they had completed their pullout the u.s. cut it further 
 not so the soviets 
 gen. <unk> himself said soviet troops expected to leave behind more than $ N billion of military equipment and installations for the kabul regime 
 since the troop withdrawal moscow has poured in an additional $ N to $ N million worth per month nearly $ N billion since february equivalent to the total u.s. aid to the resistance in nine years 
 this includes what deputy foreign minister <unk> <unk> <unk> called new peaceful <unk> weapons including more than N <unk> missiles 
 by early may moscow had delivered for example N trucks about N tanks <unk> and hundreds of other combat vehicles 
 later that month it added an entire tank <unk> including N <unk> tanks and more than N <unk> <unk> <unk> fighting vehicles 
 by september a new reinforced <unk> <unk> <unk> with an additional N combat vehicles N more trucks and N <unk> afghan troops had arrived in <unk> 
 in the last few weeks moscow has added <unk> missiles the bomber version of the <unk> <unk> <unk> aircraft <unk> which can <unk> pakistan 's <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> which can <unk> the <unk> 
 moscow claims this is all needed to protect the kabul regime against the guerrilla resistance 
 it is well-known that the regular afghan <unk> is filled with reluctant <unk> 
 but this is not the entire afghan army and it is no longer kabul 's only military force 
 complete units have been trained and <unk> in the u.s.s.r. and other east bloc nations N to N of these troops have returned 
 in addition the regime has established <unk> <unk> forces totaling more than N including N <unk> troops of the interior ministry <unk> which still is directed by N soviet kgb officers 
 even if not all these forces are committed to the regime they are now dependent on it 
 and thousands of afghan children have been taken to the soviet union where they are <unk> for the behavior of their families 
 since N indian military advisers have been <unk> the kabul regime 
 in preparation for the withdrawal moscow kabul and new <unk> signed two agreements for several hundred newly civilian indian experts to replace some of the more visible soviet military personnel 
 cuban military personnel also have been active in afghanistan since N 
 the soviets cut a deal with iran a future iranian role in afghanistan in exchange for iranian support of soviet policy 
 the deal was <unk> by the restoration of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to the afghan prime ministry 
 moreover serious questions have been raised about the claimed withdrawal of soviet forces 
 before his assassination in N president <unk> of pakistan repeatedly stated that fresh soviet troops were being inserted into afghanistan even as others were <unk> withdrawn 
 rep. bill <unk> r. fla. reports that these included N to N soviet central asian kgb border guards <unk> <unk> from <unk> and wearing <unk> <unk> 
 meanwhile the kabul regime is increasingly successful at portraying the resistance as <unk> <unk> 
 in this they are aided by years of american european <unk> and saudi support for the most extreme <unk> radical <unk> <unk> with leaders whose policies are <unk> to the afghan public 
 this heavy outside support for the worst has undermined better moderate leaders 
 in autumn last year for example the regime garrison at <unk> was prepared to surrender the city to resistance <unk> 
 at the last minute however <unk> officials sent in <unk> <unk> perhaps the most <unk> and feared of the <unk> with a demand that the surrender be made to his forces 
 the deal fell through and <unk> remains a major regime base 
 the resistance lacks not only air power <unk> and expertise but often such <unk> as <unk> mine detectors or even winter <unk> 
 experienced resistance <unk> wanted to use guerrilla action and <unk> tactics to wear down the regime 
 instead they were pressured by pakistan 's isi the channel for their support into attacking <unk> 
 they took more than N N <unk> journalists report that they faced <unk> without mine detectors 
 the wonder is not that the resistance has failed to topple the kabul regime but that it continues to exist and fight at all 
 last summer in response to congressional criticism the state department and the cia said they had resumed military aid to the resistance months after it was cut off but it is not clear how much is being sent or when it will arrive 
 for months the resistance has been <unk> against air attack 
 thus far there is no indication that they have been <unk> with <unk> or other <unk> weapons 
 indeed u.s. officials have indicated to the press that the <unk> of aid depends on what success the weakened resistance <unk> by the end of this year 
 moscow and kabul must have found that information useful 
 for a decade u.s. policy has been <unk> based on <unk> and the defense of bureaucratic and political turf 
 no settlement negotiated by others can force the afghan people to give up their struggle 
 a <unk> of u.s. military aid would merely abandon them to die in <unk> 
 creation of a new realistic u.s. policy is long overdue 
 ms. <unk> editor and co-author of afghanistan the great game <unk> freedom house directs the freedom house program on <unk> asia 
 nothing <unk> the soul of ronald reagan and his <unk> as much as the crusade to aid nicaragua 's contra rebels or the dream of building a <unk> defense shield to knock out soviet nuclear missiles 
 yet under mr. reagan 's preferred successor president bush those two <unk> <unk> causes are <unk> on the <unk> 
 and surprisingly little more than a <unk> of protest is being heard even though <unk> once <unk> fire supporting the contras and the strategic defense initiative 
 the programs have <unk> says rep. henry <unk> a conservative republican from illinois 
 yet he asserts you look around and you say who are the leaders 
 who is going to carry the water 
 it is n't surprising that president bush has n't led a crusade to pump up the contras or sdi 
 though he <unk> supports both programs mr. bush has n't been a <unk> champion of either cause as mr. reagan was 
 what 's surprising is that there is n't more of a conservative outcry as the bush administration lets the programs slip down the <unk> list 
 a combination of factors a <unk> among some conservatives a decline in the perception of a soviet threat and a <unk> with other issues seem to explain the strange <unk> 
 above all though conservative republicans who have <unk> both the contras and sdi are reluctant to attack a republican president for failing to do more though that reluctance may be <unk> 
 we want to complain we want to say something about it and we 're going to as it gets worse says rep. dan burton an indiana republican who has been a <unk> contra backer 
 but it 's like <unk> your father in the <unk> 
 you hate to do it because he 's your father 
 mr. burton says conservatives ' <unk> with mr. bush 's cautious handling of the recent unsuccessful coup in panama will make them more willing to speak out 
 of course neither president bush nor the congress has actually abandoned the contras or sdi 
 mr. bush has struck a deal with congressional leaders to provide <unk> aid to the contras until nicaragua holds national elections next february 
 but the administration has dropped any effort to win military aid for the rebels 
 and the administration 's deal with congress gives several congressional committees the right to cut off even humanitarian aid next month though the committees are likely to let aid continue until february 
 most analysts think there 's little prospect the contras can be a significant fighting force without u.s. arms and after the february election their future in any form will be <unk> at best 
 instead of focusing on the contras mr. bush has switched to urging members of congress most recently in a white house meeting yesterday to approve financing for the election campaign of political opponents of nicaragua 's sandinista government 
 the administration continues to support sdi or star wars and it recently lobbied to persuade the senate to restore some of the funds it planned to cut from the program 
 and just last week defense secretary dick cheney gave a strong speech listing compelling reasons to push ahead with sdi and saying he 'd urge president bush to veto a defense bill with inadequate funding for the program 
 but the strong pitch by mr. cheney may be too little too late to prevent damage to sdi 
 the house has already voted for a deep cut in funding and in the end the program 's backers will be hard pressed to head off some reduction in spending next year 
 and while the defense secretary is speaking out president bush himself has n't launched any <unk> campaign to drum up support as president reagan did 
 the administration also acknowledges that it is n't pursuing mr. reagan 's original vision of an <unk> shield protecting the whole u.s. but rather a more modest version 
 more <unk> to sdi supporters the bush administration appears to have <unk> accepted a new arms-control proposal from the soviet union that <unk> long-term trouble for star wars 
 the soviets have agreed to complete a treaty cutting strategic weapons without including restrictions on <unk> defenses 
 but the soviets also are insisting that they will reserve the right to withdraw from the completed <unk> treaty later on if the u.s. does sdi testing or <unk> that the soviets think violates the existing <unk> treaty 
 it will be hard down the road to persuade congress to approve money for sdi plans if lawmakers fear those plans could scuttle a completed treaty 
 as a result frank <unk> a former reagan pentagon aide who now heads the center for security policy charges that the administration 's <unk> of continued commitment to development and <unk> of the sdi program strain <unk> 
 still proponents may be <unk> away from more <unk> because they sense political <unk> have turned against <unk> the nicaraguan rebels or boosting spending on sdi particularly when the public <unk> the soviet threat is declining under mikhail gorbachev 
 in fact because communism seems to be beating a global retreat some conservatives may simply be so pleased that their <unk> philosophy is prevailing that they do n't have the fire at the moment to push controversial programs 
 the short of it is that the most <unk> among us can not get into too sour a mood with communism <unk> says mitchell <unk> a former reagan white house aide who now is president of the hudson institute 
 some activists are <unk> to raise the profile of the two causes 
 but they say they ca n't make much <unk> because of a lack of willing leaders in a position to turn the tide 
 one longtime champion of these programs in congress republican whip <unk> <unk> of georgia is <unk> by questions about his ethics conservatives note 
 other conservative <unk> like wyoming republican sen. malcolm <unk> a longtime sdi advocate do n't have the clout with the bush white house that they enjoyed with president reagan 
 above all though proponents say neither the contra nor the sdi cause can be pushed much further without more presidential support 
 for there to be wind in the <unk> of any program the chief executive has to be <unk> in the <unk> says rep. burton 
 all this causes rep. <unk> to <unk> about an <unk> way to drum up more enthusiasm 
 what i 'd like to see if he is up to it is for reagan to take to the <unk> to <unk> enthusiasm for sdi the congressman says 
 we 're sorry to report that on monday president bush accepted the resignation of william allen as chairman of the u.s. civil rights commission 
 mr. allen appointed by president reagan grew <unk> tired of dealing with the guerrilla tactics of his enemies 
 his recent speech <unk> titled blacks animals <unk> what is a minority caused an <unk> when its title <unk> out 
 mr. allen 's commissioners voted to call his <unk> speech <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> 
 commissioner mary francis berry said it was another sad episode in the <unk> of the <unk> missile who is chairman 
 rep. don edwards the california democrat warned mr. allen that the speech would be outside the scope of the commission 's jurisdiction 
 thomas <unk> head of the <unk> legal defense fund called the prospect of the speech frankly <unk> 
 we 've actually read the speech 
 mr. allen began it with a warning to his hosts a california church group that opposes rights for <unk> 
 he said that other participants in the conference do not believe that the rights of americans should be guaranteed to citizens who are homosexual but that i mean to persuade you to the opposite view 
 he recalled to the audience a strange <unk> <unk> he once heard arguing now that we have finally recognized that american blacks have rights we need to do the same for animals 
 mr. allen <unk> to this <unk> because it seems to <unk> the status of blacks to that of animals as a mere project of charity of <unk> 
 rights on such a basis whether for blacks or <unk> are mere <unk> he said subject to being taken back 
 he says the title of his speech was to make his point that americans have rights as individuals not as members of certain select groups 
 his speech criticized the <unk> of <unk> of protected groups in society as opposed to individual <unk> or as he put it in a common <unk> as americans 
 instead of lobbying for special treatment mr. allen said that <unk> and others should try to ensure equal treatment under the law and not aim for special privileges that would risk <unk> <unk> with government <unk> 
 this hardly sounds like an <unk> <unk> 
 what 's really going on here 
 the three most important things to understand about mr. allen is that he is a black conservative intellectual a triple threat to the liberal establishment 
 mr. allen who teaches government at prestigious <unk> <unk> college in california and will remain a member of the commission has spent years arguing that civil rights are individuals ' rights 
 he last made waves when he <unk> to defend an indian girl who had been adopted by <unk> parents off her <unk> 
 mr. allen quickly ran up against the liberal establishment again which somehow <unk> the vague concept of indian rights above the rights of individual indians 
 there is a huge divide between mr. allen 's <unk> view and the divisive litigation approach of the civil rights groups 
 indeed the gap is so large that mr. allen 's critics refuse to engage the debate 
 their <unk> of him is no substitute for argument 
 their effort to run him out of washington is an embarrassment to the original purpose of their own movement 
 we hope the next head of the civil rights commission will be as <unk> as mr. allen in making the case for <unk> of civil rights

 polaroid corp. benefiting from <unk> savings reported a strong gain in third-quarter operating results and net income of $ N million or N cents a share after <unk> requirements 
 analysts said the numbers were better than expectations partly because of strong profit margins and a positive foreign-currency translation 
 however they said the company 's flat revenue was a disappointment and an indication that sales of polaroid 's new conventional film in the u.s. have been sluggish 
 revenue in the third quarter was $ N million almost unchanged from $ N million a year earlier 
 polaroid reported operating profit before taxes and interest costs of $ N million for the third quarter more than double the <unk> $ N million 
 charges for staff cuts and other restructuring produced a net loss of $ N million or N cents a share in N 's third quarter 
 i 'm somewhat skeptical about the underlying demand for polaroid products said michael <unk> an analyst with wertheim schroder & co 
 if you believe that a good performance next year is contingent on an acceleration of revenue there is n't a lot here to base optimism on 
 alex henderson an analyst with prudential-bache says polaroid officials told him yesterday that u.s. sales of the company 's new conventional film product introduced in the second quarter have been disappointing after a promising start

 why is the stock market suddenly so volatile 
 yesterday the dow jones industrial average did a now familiar dance it plunged N points before lunch with most of the drop <unk> in N minutes 
 then it rebounded to finish down only N points 
 and those swings <unk> <unk> friday 's 190.58-point plunge and monday 's <unk> recovery 
 it 's <unk> that in an hour you can <unk> off so much value says stanford <unk> chairman of trinity investment management corp. boston 
 and apparently it is here to stay 
 richard bernstein senior <unk> analyst at merrill lynch & co says my gut feel is that we 'll live with those swings for a while 
 there are many reasons for the market 's <unk> new trading vehicles such as stock-index futures and options computer-driven strategies like program trading and crowd psychology 
 but most are linked by a single theme liquidity the ability to get in and out of the market quickly 
 prices are moving up and down so fast because investors are <unk> ways to turn over shares at <unk> rates and increasingly acting in concert 
 institutions are <unk> animals says peter anderson who heads the <unk> management arm of <unk> financial services inc 
 we watch the same indicators and listen to the same <unk> 
 like <unk> we tend to move in the same direction at same time 
 and that naturally <unk> price movements 
 institutions who now account for most trading count on being able to buy and sell big blocks of stock at an <unk> 
 but when they discover that markets are n't always as liquid as they supposed markets jump 
 on monday for instance howard ward a principal at <unk> stevens & clark found that you could n't buy <unk> at quoted prices without paying up 
 and when many firms had to pay up monday 's sudden rally was sparked 
 trading in futures and options some people believe can add to volatility 
 investors believe they can can rely on such derivative securities to get in and out of the stock market without actually selling any stocks that is a way of staying liquid even when they own stocks 
 these and other modern trading methods tend to promote dramatic shifts in assets says george douglas first vice president at drexel burnham lambert inc 
 it 's the idea that what goes in easy can come out easy so that <unk> of higher volatility get built into the stock market 
 one new investment style called asset allocation shifts portfolio <unk> between stocks bonds and cash when computer models say one is more attractive 
 for instance first <unk> corp. an asset <unk> based in morristown n.j. said it quickly boosted stock positions in its aggressive accounts to N N from N N to take advantage of plunging prices friday 
 it added another N N monday before stocks rallied 
 when they did the firm reduced those stock holdings to about N N 
 a classic example of institutions ' <unk> for liquidity is portfolio insurance now widely <unk> 
 before the N crash an estimated $ N billion in institutional money was managed under this hedging technique 
 the idea was to insure the value of a portfolio by selling futures when stock prices dropped eliminating the need to sell the stocks themselves 
 but in october N when portfolio insurers rushed to sell at the same time they <unk> both the stock and futures markets 
 yet even today institutions are quietly practicing forms of portfolio insurance by nervously rushing to and <unk> in the markets 
 others are doing index arbitrage a strategy of taking advantage of price discrepancies between stocks and futures 
 unlike traditional <unk> strategies all of the above require that market makers be on hand to provide liquidity by buying and selling stocks in a crunch 
 but institutions say wall street brokerage firms are less willing to make markets 
 brokers do n't deny that 
 wall street traders say that with institutional brokerage commissions far lower than in the 1970s securities firms ca n't afford to take the risk of buying too much stock 
 i think everyone 's a little more leery says jack baker head of equity trading at <unk> lehman hutton inc 
 the institutions have driven commission rates down to the point where it makes no sense to commit capital says tom <unk> senior executive vice president in charge of institutional trading at oppenheimer & co 
 why should i risk money for a guy for who 's paying me five cents a dance 
 all you get is risk 
 lack of liquidity can also result from exchange reforms 
 many traders say that circuit breakers put in place to damp volatility after the N crash actually added to volatility when the stock market plunged friday 
 the circuit breakers caused a <unk> shutdown in trading in standard & poor 's 500-stock index futures contract as the markets were falling 
 with the <unk> halt you could only sell stocks to cut exposure to the market says a money manager 
 it was scary to people thinking that they could n't get their trades off 
 it was like they put you in a room with a <unk> and told you there were three doors to exit said one chicago-based futures trader 
 then they said by the way two of the doors are locked 
 the takeover mania also adds to volatility 
 ual corp. is a good example 
 valued as a buy-out target the airline stock was trading at nearly $ N a share 
 when the deal ran into trouble the stock tumbled it closed at $ N yesterday 
 presumably ual is now trading closer to its value based on earnings 
 by contrast traditional <unk> investors are unlikely to generate sudden price moves 
 scott black a <unk> money manager who heads <unk> management inc. points out that for those who invest on fundamentals the value of a stock from day to day does n't change all that much 
 some experts say markets are n't as volatile as widely assumed 
 <unk> stoll finance professor at <unk> university says the current volatility in u.s. markets <unk> in comparison to the 1930s decades before derivative instruments such as options and futures were introduced 
 i just ca n't believe that the <unk> in the financial market are causing any of this volatility he says 
 and robert d. <unk> president of asset <unk> first <unk> notes that before friday 's tailspin daily volatility on the new york stock exchange in recent weeks had reached historically low levels 
 some people tend to ignore that a <unk> move is less in percentage terms than it was when the stock market was lower 
 john j. phelan jr. chairman of the big board asserts that N and N have been two of the least volatile years in the last N or N years 
 but the low average volatility mr. phelan is talking about is n't any comfort in a period of rapid stock-market moves like the past week 
 in addition sanford <unk> a <unk> school finance professor says volatile <unk> in stock prices will continue as long as liquidity falls short of the <unk> demands of institutions who can go out and say i have a billion dollars of stocks to sell 
 some people think the search for liquidity is <unk> 
 in N john maynard <unk> wrote that of the <unk> of orthodox finance none surely is more <unk> than the <unk> of liquidity 
 it leads investors to focus on short-term price movements a game of musical chairs he called it rather than on long-term fundamental valuation

 the national aeronautics and space administration said a computer virus has infected one of its networks and is spreading anti-nuclear messages related to its galileo space probe which is to be launched today 
 charles redmond a nasa spokesman said the agency discovered the virus on monday on the collection of computer networks <unk> called <unk> and expected N university centers to be infected by today 
 although the network is n't connected to the computer systems that operate either galileo or the shuttle part of the network will carry <unk> of galileo data once the craft gets <unk> 
 mr. redmond said the <unk> had n't yet done any harm but the agency feared garbage data could be <unk> for real data 
 he estimated it could take a day for a computer security manager to <unk> the virus from a computer system 
 the <unk> among the <unk> yet to hit a research network appeared to affect only digital equipment corp. hardware that uses digital 's <unk> operating system 
 it is unrelated to the <unk> virus that last year infected <unk> a much larger network used by researchers at universities laboratories and government agencies around the world 
 in the <unk> of computer security the nasa <unk> is technically a computer worm mr. redmond said 
 a worm <unk> in the operating system of a computer and spreads by boring into other computers contacted through networks 
 the galileo worm apparently was <unk> on a computer in france <unk> up to nasa 's space physics analysis network mr. redmond said 
 nasa said the galileo worm had n't affected its computers or the computers of other government agencies because they had modified their systems to reject <unk> 
 but mr. redmond said the worm hit universities that had n't elected to make the changes 
 michael alexander a senior editor at <unk> a trade publication said he was told that the worm gets into a computer center by looking for obvious <unk> such as ones that are the same as the user 's name 
 if it finds one and gets into the system it will display a screen when a user <unk> on that says <unk> against nuclear <unk> 
 you talk of times of peace for all and then prepare for war 
 in addition mr. alexander said the worm sends strange messages to other machines at the center such as george <unk> was an <unk> or do n't feed the <unk> tonight 
 the worm also looks for <unk> <unk> that <unk> more privileges on the user 
 the <unk> are included in the system software when it is installed but are supposed to be replaced as soon as the system is up and running 
 if it finds one of those <unk> mr. alexander said the worm will do such things as change users ' <unk> to a series of random numbers preventing them from signing on to the network 
 nasa estimated that on monday about four computer centers were affected 
 yesterday the number grew to N today the number is expected to grow to N 
 nasa said it will take about a week before it knows exactly how many centers of the N connected to <unk> were affected and the extent of the damage if any 
 anti-nuclear activists have <unk> the launch of the galileo space probe to jupiter because it uses <unk> to generate the electricity needed to run the craft 
 activists fear that if the shuttle carrying galileo into <unk> should <unk> or if galileo itself crashes into the earth during the two times it flies close to the planet fatal levels of <unk> would be released into the atmosphere 
 so far galileo has been delayed twice once because of a computer <unk> connected with a <unk> engine and yesterday because of the weather 
 nasa said the galileo worm had nothing to do with either delay 
 mr. alexander of <unk> said <unk> have gone after span before

 it is now a <unk> that prosecutors are bringing criminal <unk> in cases where until a few years ago only a civil action at most would have been brought 
 yet it is also <unk> that the power to create new crimes belongs only to the legislature and not to courts 
 beginning in the early 19th century with u.s. v. hudson and <unk> the supreme court has repeatedly held that a judicial power to declare conduct to be against the public interest and hence criminal while well established in british law would <unk> legislative authority under the doctrine of separation of powers 
 that 's the conventional theory anyway 
 in practice however the line between interpretation and <unk> of the criminal law long ago began to <unk> 
 in particular a common law of white-collar crime has developed with surprising <unk> over the past decade 
 for example although insider trading has long been criminal it has never been <unk> defined 
 in N the supreme court tried to supply a <unk> definition in the <unk> v. sec decision which found that liability depended on whether the <unk> had <unk> his fiduciary duty to the corporation in order to obtain some personal gain and whether the <unk> knew or <unk> <unk> this fact 
 gradually however lower courts and prosecutors have pushed this definition to its breaking point 
 consider the facts underlying the N conviction of robert chestman 
 prior to a tender offer by <unk> for <unk> inc. in N the founder of the <unk> 's supermarket chain called an elderly relative to tell her to <unk> her stock certificates for delivery 
 she called her daughter to take her to the bank who in turn persuaded her husband a mr. <unk> to run this <unk> 
 hearing of this information the husband discussed it with his broker mr. chestman and mr. chestman then bought for his own account and other clients 
 basically mr. chestman was a <unk> <unk> 
 did mr. <unk> his <unk> breach a fiduciary duty and if so to whom 
 did mr. <unk> seek personal gain and if so how 
 or did mr. chestman only hear a market rumor which one may <unk> trade upon 
 the line seems <unk> thin for <unk> purposes 
 a second illustration is supplied by the recent guilty plea entered by robert freeman formerly head of arbitrage at goldman sachs & co 
 essentially mr. freeman had invested heavily in the beatrice leveraged buy-out when he was told by another prominent trader bernard bunny <unk> that the deal was in trouble 
 after placing orders to sell mr. freeman called martin <unk> an investment banker at kidder peabody & co. who was advising on the deal to confirm these rumors 
 mr. <unk> asked mr. freeman who his source was and on hearing that it was bunny <unk> responded well your bunny has a good nose 
 the illegal tip of the bunny 's good nose was then largely a confirmation of rumors already known to many in the market 
 had the case gone to trial the same issues would have surfaced 
 was there a fiduciary breach in order to obtain personal gain 
 did mr. freeman have notice of this 
 finally was the information material 
 yet all these issues are subsidiary to a more central issue who is and who should be making the criminal law here 
 it is not my <unk> that either mr. chestman or mr. freeman was an innocent victim of prosecutorial <unk> 
 <unk> both were on notice that their behavior was at least risky 
 but even if they behaved <unk> reasons still exist to fear and resist this steady process of <unk> judicial extension of the law of insider trading 
 courts and legislatures make decisions in very different ways and are each susceptible to very different kinds of errors 
 <unk> judicial examination of an actor 's conduct has always been the common law 's method 
 when only civil liability is involved this method has the <unk> strengths of <unk> <unk> and <unk> of <unk> 
 still <unk> <unk> decision making of this sort is vulnerable to the tunnel vision caused by a <unk> on ad <unk> and usually <unk> examples 
 when a court decides that a particular actor 's conduct was <unk> and so <unk> the definition of insider trading to reach this conduct it does not see the potentially enormous number of other cases that will be covered by the expanded rule 
 thus a court is poorly positioned to make judgments about the social utility of the expanded rule 
 for example in focusing on mr. freeman 's attempt to gain <unk> information about a deal 's collapse one does not naturally think about the reverse side of the coin what if the rumor had been false 
 can a security analyst call an investment banker to make certain that a seemingly <unk> rumor is in fact false 
 in the past not only would reputable professionals have rushed to check out such rumors with the company but companies listed on the major stock exchanges were encouraged by the exchanges to respond openly to such inquiries from securities analysts 
 today after mr. freeman 's plea there is an uncertainty that is both unfair and inefficient 
 in this light the <unk> advantages of legislative <unk> become clear N before it acts the legislature typically will hear the views of representatives of all those affected by its decision not just the immediate parties before the court and N the legislature can frame bright line standards that create less uncertainty than the <unk> decisions of courts 
 although legislative lines can result in <unk> which explains why the sec has long resisted a legislative definition of insider trading judicial <unk> inevitably creates uncertainty because of the <unk> outer <unk> and implications of most judicial decisions 
 at least when the stakes are high uncertainty in turn results in <unk> as individuals do not <unk> to approach an uncertain line closely 
 the federal mail and wire fraud statutes provide even better <unk> of the rapid evolution of a federal common law of white-collar crime 
 in N the supreme court attempted in <unk> v. u.s. to halt the <unk> expansion of these statutes by adopting a rule of strict construction for <unk> criminal <unk> 
 yet late last year congress effectively reversed this decision by <unk> a <unk> statute that defined fraud to include any scheme to <unk> another of the <unk> right of honest services 
 at a <unk> this may <unk> all fiduciary <unk> and possibly all <unk> by an agent or employee 
 such a statute illustrates the fundamental problem congress finds it is easier to pass <unk> <unk> <unk> which the courts must thereafter interpret than to engage in the difficult <unk> <unk> that are <unk> its responsibility 
 we are confronted less with a judicial power grab than with a legislative <unk> 
 predictably when confronted with morally dubious behavior prosecutors will exploit the <unk> such <unk> statutes give them 
 over the long run however <unk> cases will make bad law

 banks are continuing to go after individual investors despite falling interest rates

 banks want to remain competitive said <unk> mehl chairman of banxquote 
 october is a big <unk> month and perhaps they anticipate greater demand among people leaving the stock market

 the dow has more ups and <unk> than an <unk> proclaimed an <unk> monday in new york newspapers touting lincoln savings bank 's one-year cd 
 harold jones lincoln 's chief retail banking officer said there has n't yet been a <unk> response although the ad included a coupon that could arrive later in the week 
 friday 's market rout came <unk> in the middle of the heaviest month for cd <unk> when a number of banks and thrifts already have promotions under way 
 first national bank of boston for example is offering certain new <unk> an extra quarter of a percentage point on six-month and 12-month cds 
 some banks actually boosted yields on the <unk> term cds in the latest week 
 new york 's citibank for instance increased the yield on <unk> three-month cds to N N from N N 
 on average however three-month cds at major banks are yielding a <unk> of a percentage point less than they were a week ago 
 average yields on cds aimed at individual investors fell less than half as much as yields on treasury bills sold at monday 's auction 
 six-month cds of $ N and less yielded an average N N in the week ended tuesday down from N N according to banxquote 
 the yield on six-month <unk> fell to N N on monday from N N the week before 
 meanwhile the average yield on six-month cds of more than $ N fell to N N in the latest week according to banxquote from N N the week before 
 mr. mehl noted that actual rates are almost identical on small and <unk> cds but yields on cds aimed at the individual investor are boosted by more frequent <unk> 
 cds sold by major brokerage houses which like jumbo cds tend to closely follow interest rate trends also posted larger drops in yields 
 a six-month <unk> cd for example was yielding an average N N in the latest week a fifth of a percentage point lower than the week before 
 in late april when interest rates were at their recent highs short-term cds sold by brokers were offering yields half a percentage point or more higher than banks 
 cd yields are generally expected to fall further in coming weeks 
 what happened in the stock market and the bigger trade deficit reported yesterday make it unlikely that short-term interest rates will rise any time soon said mr. mehl of banxquote 
 even before the market drop rates were down about half a percentage point said robert j. hutchinson senior vice president for retail marketing at manufacturers hanover trust co. in new york 
 that puts pressure on cd rates 
 conservatives have an important decision to make this fall 
 at the recent meetings of the world bank and international monetary fund the bush administration announced its intention to decide by <unk> the size of the next increase in the imf 's capital base 
 while the u.s. share of the increase probably will not reach the $ N billion or more implicit in the imf 's request for a doubling of its $ N billion capital the administration probably will agree to a multibillion-dollar increase 
 this would be consistent with its <unk> support for the brady plan and <unk> exchange-rate intervention and with its financial commitment to mexico poland and others 
 the imf has several reasons for <unk> the increase 
 its role in the economies of developing countries has grown steadily since the 1970s 
 the size and pace of <unk> will accelerate further under the brady plan which promises larger and earlier <unk> to approved countries 
 at least three other factors have encouraged the imf to insist on increased capital 
 first it argues that its capital base must be increased in order to maintain its size relative to world financial markets for which it feels some responsibility 
 second the world bank 's recent $ N billion capital increase $ N billion from the u.s. has left the imf feeling less than first <unk> among international financial institutions 
 third the imf would like to meet japan 's request for increased ownership currently N N 
 japan has supported a larger role for the imf in developing-country debt issues and is an important financial resource for <unk> programs in developing countries 
 while international politics may argue for the capital increase there is a clear economic case against it 
 opponents of the increase argue that the imf practices central planning while supporting <unk> governments 
 they question whether the imf has any role in developing countries given its original mandate to assist industrial countries in <unk> <unk> 
 opponents show that there are already more funds available than <unk> reform efforts 
 they worry that new imf funding of developing countries will simply end up <unk> imf debt for <unk> commercial bank debt a bad trade all around 
 they believe <unk> which addresses the problems of markets investment climate and management practices is the key to developing-country growth not the imf 's <unk> focus on trade deficits quarterly targets and government debt 
 they point at the numerous developing-country governments that have inflated taxed and regulated themselves into <unk> under <unk> imf programs 
 decisions on increases in the imf 's capital base traditionally are made by the administration with subsequent authorization by congress 
 the last u.s. congressional authorization in N was a political <unk> and carried a $ N billion housing program along with it to secure adequate votes 
 the politics of the N congressional authorization are likely to be similar to those of previous <unk> 
 liberals may support the stabilizing <unk> role of the imf on two conditions that the administration give assurances that liberal democrats ' support will not be used against them in congressional re-election campaigns and that the legislation address with dollars social and environmental concerns 
 conservative republicans will be given the choice of supporting or fighting their party 's popular president in an election year 
 a u.s. decision to refuse the imf its capital increase or limit it to N N would bring a major change in international economic policy and could not be taken <unk> 
 <unk> would <unk> over the implications for the <unk> coordination process and the stability of world financial markets 
 because commercial banks and the developing-country governments believe they will get a piece of any capital increase a <unk> imf mission would leave both feeling <unk> 
 furthermore a u.s. rejection of the capital increase and transfer of shares to japan would give japan an argument against future calls for economic <unk> 
 on the other hand a decision to increase the imf 's capital would reinforce the central economic role of <unk> institutions in developing countries 
 with the increase even more developing-country energy and talent would be diverted from creating profitable economic systems to setting up economic planning ministries that generate <unk> economic plans 
 <unk> the <unk> could slow economic development even further as countries delay <unk> steps in anticipation of richer <unk> support 
 conservatives should take a position prior to the administration 's year-end deadline 
 the issues are too important to be left to the financial and budget ministries fighting over the size of the capital increase rather than its purpose 
 if conservatives do n't support an increase in the imf 's capital then it is incumbent on them to speak up now and explain the alternative

 in a move that could pose a new competitive challenge to time warner inc. 's powerful home box office cable giant tele-communications inc. agreed to buy half of showtime networks inc. from viacom inc. for $ N million 
 the purchase comes after nearly three years of <unk> <unk> talks between tci and viacom which has also discussed the sale of an interest in showtime with other cable operators 
 showtime is a distant no. N to home box office and in may filed a $ N billion antitrust suit against time warner charging the company and its hbo and american television cable units with conspiring to <unk> the pay tv business 
 hbo has close to N million subscribers to its hbo and <unk> networks while showtime and its sister service the movie channel have only about N million according to paul <unk> associates a <unk> calif. research firm 
 for tci the investment in showtime puts it in an unusual position as the largest cable operator with control of close to N million of the nation 's N million cable subscribers tci is hbo 's largest customer 
 but tci president john <unk> has long been concerned about hbo 's dominance of the pay tv business and has been eager to keep showtime as a healthy competitor 
 it is important to the cable industry that we have a <unk> and competitive <unk> marketplace mr. <unk> said in a statement 
 in a telephone interview robert thomson tci senior vice president said showtime 's suit against hbo does n't involve us and nothing we 're doing here bears any relationship to that 
 he added we do n't intend to be drawn into it noting that tci wo n't play any active role in the management of showtime 
 linking up showtime with the largest cable operator in the u.s. could sharply boost its subscribers 
 tci said it may bring in other cable operators as investors a practice it has employed in the past with investments in other cable networks such as the discovery channel 
 additional cable partners could boost subscribers even further 
 time warner declined comment 
 in addition to owning hbo time warner owns american television & communications inc. the nation 's second largest cable operator after tci 
 viacom also owns cable systems but it is the <unk> largest operator of such systems with less than one million subscribers 
 the tci investment is a big victory for viacom 's chief executive officer frank <unk> and <unk> h. cox president of the showtime unit 
 this takes any question of showtime 's viability and puts it away once and for all mr. <unk> said in a telephone interview 
 the fight between hbo and showtime is particularly <unk> because mr. <unk> is the former chief executive of hbo and mr. cox served as chief of marketing for the service 
 they were both hired by <unk> <unk> the boston billionaire who took control of viacom three years ago in a leveraged buy-out
