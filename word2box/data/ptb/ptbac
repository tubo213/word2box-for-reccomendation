y laws could be used to <unk> state regulation 
 however creditors and bidders alike concede that the state plays a major role because it could significantly delay final settlement of a plan it did n't like 
 the state has endorsed the new england electric plan which promises to limit rate increases to N N annually for seven years 
 northeast utilities ' plan proposes N N annual increases 
 ps of new hampshire amended its plan to call for two years of N N rate increases followed by five years of N N increases 
 fuel cost adjustments could change the effective rate increases however 
 previously it had proposed seven years of N N increases 
 united illuminating also amended its rate plan 
 the new offer assumes just five years of N N rate increases to be followed by <unk> increases under the usual hearing procedure 
 previously united illuminating had also called for seven years of N N increases 
 the bids and rate proposals generally assume the seabrook nuclear power plant which is completed will go into operation 
 most of the plans have reduced bids in case the plant fails to get a license from the nuclear regulatory commission

 c. <unk> tucker will become president and chief executive officer of bell atlantic international inc. a unit of this telecommunications concern effective jan. N 
 mr. tucker N years old is currently vice president and chief operating officer of bell atlantic 's <unk> telephone unit 
 mr. tucker will succeed <unk> j. <unk> N who will hold the newly created position of chairman of the international unit until his retirement april N 
 richard breeden had n't noticed that his new desk had just four telephone lines and one phone 
 it was after all only his second full day as chairman of the securities and exchange commission 
 but the lack of lines became painfully apparent 
 as the stock market <unk> into a 190-point free fall on oct. N mr. breeden found himself <unk> around the sixth floor of the sec from his desk where the new york stock exchange was on an open line to his assistant 's office where the commodity futures trading commission was connected to a third room where a computer monitored market moves 
 with other anxious calls pouring in he recalls i 'd either have to <unk> the new york stock exchange or go out to the secretary 's desk 
 it wo n't happen again 
 now there are more lines connected to the chairman 's office and the <unk> computer has been moved next to his desk 
 it 's all part of a new command center 
 the changes in the office <unk> illustrate mr. breeden 's stance as the nation 's top securities regulator 
 like his predecessor david <unk> he was faced with a crisis in the stock markets soon after coming into office 
 but unlike mr. <unk> who during the N crash damaged himself by saying rather <unk> that the markets might be closed mr. breeden is turning the market drop to his own advantage using it to further his agenda for the sec 
 in an interview and in congressional testimony he repeatedly points to the recent 190-point plunge in the dow jones industrial average the second-largest ever as evidence of the need for congress to give the sec the ability to better monitor leveraged buy-out loan activity by brokerage firms and to track big trades in the market 
 a veteran of another financial crisis the savings-and-loan bailout mr. breeden wants to have the sec regulate securities issued by banks and s&ls 
 more broadly he wants to modernize regulation by eliminating barriers between commercial and investment banking and by helping u.s. financial firms compete in the global market 
 he believes the tax code encourages the use of debt instead of stock and may fuel leveraged buy-outs an area the sec does n't regulate directly but one where it <unk> influence both on wall street and in congress 
 also unlike mr. <unk> mr. breeden appears to be in a position to get somewhere with his agenda 
 as a former white house aide who worked closely with congress he is <unk> in the ways of washington 
 what 's more the coming months likely will offer him the opportunity to obtain his own majority on the <unk> commission enabling him to avoid the <unk> that frustrated his predecessor 
 but mr. breeden a <unk> securities lawyer has <unk> some of the <unk> issues facing the financial markets 
 for instance he has n't stated a clear position on high-risk high-yield junk bonds an area of growing concern as turmoil in the junk market <unk> over into stocks 
 he may be waiting to see the results of several pending sec studies of junk market liquidity and disclosure rules 
 he also has kept a close wrap on the names of people under consideration for the crucial post of enforcement director at the commission a job vacant since the summer 
 mr. breeden 's selection will be <unk> as an important signal about the strength of his commitment to continuing the sec 's <unk> pursuit of insider trading and market manipulation on wall street 
 congress seems likely to let the new chairman have his way for a while 
 members of the senate banking committee know mr. breeden from working on the <unk> bill and the relationship generally remains warm 
 indeed during mr. breeden 's confirmation hearing last month senators asked him to introduce his children three separate times more often than they asked about his <unk> for the job 
 these days mr. breeden is winning <unk> in washington and on wall street for his <unk> role in monitoring the friday-the-13th market plunge and the following monday 's <unk> morning session 
 as a regulator charged with restoring investor confidence mr. breeden avoided making <unk> comments and worked to gather information critical to wall street and to other government agencies 
 not everyone has jumped on the breeden <unk> however 
 some in washington contend that it 's too soon to tell whether mr. breeden will help or <unk> the sec 
 i do n't think this was a real test says one congressional aide 
 it was a fairly <unk> weekend but my sense is if you had n't had richard breeden there it would n't have made much of a difference 
 for some at the sec an agency that <unk> its independence mr. breeden may be too much of a washington insider 
 they note that he has <unk> his office with five photos of george bush one of them featuring the first dog <unk> 
 they worry that mr. breeden also will roll over when told to do so by the white house 
 but mr. breeden already has shown an eagerness to run the sec his way 
 during the monday market rebound a new york exchange spokesman told cable news network viewers that the industrial average had turned down N points 
 stunned mr. breeden turned to his <unk> computer which by then was next to his desk 
 it showed the <unk> up N points 
 sec staffers soon determined that a widely watched stock-market service quotron had <unk> the industrial average 
 mr. breeden instructed sec staffers to inform the network that it was airing the wrong number 
 it was the plunge that did n't happen he says 
 mr. breeden also is trying to use a far more catastrophic event the california earthquake to move another rule change past congress 
 that disaster closed the pacific stock exchange 's stock <unk> operation forcing those options to be switched to other exchanges temporarily 
 though <unk> to most investors the question of whether to list options on more than one exchange has aroused much interest in congress mainly because regional exchanges fear the change could bankrupt them 
 congressmen raised the issue yesterday at a hearing 
 mr. breeden not missing a chance to press his agenda cited the earthquake 
 that event he contended simply shows the <unk> of having listings on only one exchange 
 in a corner of the <unk> new nippon convention center sits mazda motor corp. 's <unk> display

 welcome to the <unk> tokyo motor show 
 here you can find mitsubishi motors corp. <unk> a live fish <unk> a truck <unk> to an <unk> on wheels and nissan motor co. with its <unk> <unk> whose doors <unk> upon recognizing the owner 's <unk> 
 <unk> motor co. 's <unk> sport vehicle features a <unk> rear <unk> and invites drivers to go back to the nature 
 but this <unk> event the world 's largest display of cars and trucks has its serious side including the first major <unk> of future engines and <unk> systems 
 it 's also the prime <unk> for a country whose world dominance in the industry is increasingly acknowledged and <unk> lies the draw 
 even the biggest auto shows in the u.s. are largely regional affairs but the tokyo show is international 
 virtually every automotive analyst in new york showed up 
 <unk> flights were booked solid this week as motor city executives including ford motor co. chairman donald e. <unk> and chrysler corp. vice chairman gerald <unk> <unk> to see the future 
 even the soviet union came for the first time in N years to show off its <unk> <unk> sedan and its <unk> <unk> <unk> model 
 here 's a <unk> look at what the japanese hosts <unk> and what the foreign visitors saw 
 new technology 
 the hottest displays were items that <unk> passengers from <unk> <unk> and other <unk> of the road 
 these active suspension systems electronically sense road conditions and adjust a car 's ride 
 existing suspension systems try to absorb <unk> but active suspension provides power to counter the <unk> 
 nissan in a <unk> <unk> modestly compares its <unk> active suspension to a <unk> and <unk> the various parts to the animal 's heart brain nerves and blood vessels 
 toyota motor corp. <unk> touted its system in a car that <unk> in half to reveal the suspension 's inner workings 
 nissan says it will introduce its first system next month on the infiniti <unk> luxury sedan and toyota 's <unk> <unk> will go on sale with the suspension device next spring 
 but drivers in the u.s. must wait the japanese for now are keeping active suspension for domestic use only 
 and detroit 's big three auto makers say their systems are still under development 
 in the engine department several companies displayed experimental models that within a decade could provide power equal to today 's engines and yet take up only half the space allowing for shorter <unk> 
 in the so-called <unk> engines which are expected to get sharply higher gas <unk> each <unk> goes up and down only once to provide power 
 by contrast the <unk> in conventional <unk> engines must move up and down twice in each power cycle 
 the <unk> engine displays by toyota and fuji heavy industries the maker of <unk> cars drew plenty of interest from u.s. auto executives who are rushing to develop <unk> engines 
 honda motor co. shows a more conventional <unk> engine in the new accord <unk> model which made its debut just this month in japan only 
 honda says the <unk> engine provides a compromise between the <unk> of a <unk> and the power of a <unk> 
 it is rumored to be bound for a new model in the luxury <unk> line in the u.s. but honda officials would n't comment 
 odd cars funny names 
 there 's plenty of <unk> here but it is n't always clear whether it 's <unk> 
 the show 's symbol is a woman riding on a <unk> not your usual <unk> for speed and <unk> 
 but the sponsors have an explanation through the character associated with a <unk> they say important values such as harmony with nature and aspirations for the future are sought 
 japanese auto makers are known for coming up with funny names but this year the practice seems to have reached a new high or low 
 honda has a tiny <unk> called the <unk> and a slightly larger <unk> the <unk> 
 mitsubishi has a <unk> delivery truck called the <unk> 
 mazda has the <unk> truck and under its <unk> <unk> a <unk> called the <unk> 
 its <unk> carol <unk> is designed with softness <unk> and <unk> 
 but the court <unk> appears to be japan 's smallest car maker <unk> motor co 
 one of its <unk> <unk> is the <unk> <unk> which seats just one person in front and could hold a small child and bag of <unk> in the rear 
 <unk> also has the fellow N the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> 
 the jokes are n't just on the japanese though 
 <unk> <unk> des <unk> renault the french auto maker has a concept car called the <unk> 
 the name is supposed to <unk> <unk> <unk> but in japanese it means <unk> 
 foreign presence 
 foreign auto makers are taking the tokyo motor show more seriously than ever 
 ab <unk> invites <unk> to play the role of the test <unk> by <unk> in a car that <unk> a crash to show just how its <unk> <unk> works 
 hyundai motor co. of south korea has its <unk> exhibit in tokyo 
 general motors corp. is <unk> its first independent display in N years and it includes a <unk> buick station <unk> with <unk> side panels 
 ford and chrysler also have <unk> although theirs are <unk> in a separate room with the <unk> automotive parts section 
 we 've got to get out of the detroit mentality and be part of the world mentality declares charles m. jordan gm 's vice president for design in explaining his <unk> to the tokyo show 
 even so traditional american <unk> is n't <unk> endangered 
 ford officials for example <unk> about their <unk> tokyo grand <unk> racing victory 
 true ford was declared the winner sunday but only after the honda driver who crossed the finish line first was <unk> because it hit another car and <unk> <unk> out of <unk> 
 mr. jordan of gm meanwhile still <unk> japanese <unk> 
 it 's hard for the japanese he says to get a feeling in a car to get a passion in a car to get <unk> in a car 
 regarding your sept. N politics & policy column on the party differences over cutting capital gains or expanding iras why not compromise now and save the public from the coming <unk> congressional political rhetoric that seems to go hand in hand with the process 
 the republicans maintain that a N N capital-gains exclusion will raise revenue in the short term and spur economic investment while the democrats maintain that an increase in the top income-tax rate and expanded iras will raise revenue and spur savings 
 this is a classic example of the old saying the whole is greater than the sum of its parts 
 it 's ridiculous for a family with taxable income of $ N to pay the same N N <unk> tax rate as a family with taxable income of $ N 
 the N N <unk> should apply to all income over the applicable level not just the N N rate adjustment amount 
 it 's equally ridiculous not to provide a capital investment or <unk> tax incentive 
 jeffrey t. <unk> 
 pwa corp. said it plans to sell by spring N all N passenger planes it acquired earlier this year in its N million canadian dollar us$ N million purchase of <unk> inc 
 pwa which recently merged <unk> 's operations with those of <unk> canadian airlines international ltd. canada 's <unk> airline said the proposed sale is part of a revised five-year plan aimed at streamlining its fleet and shedding debt 
 pwa would n't estimate the value of <unk> 's aircraft which include N airbus <unk> and three boeing <unk> 
 but james ireland a miami-based technical analyst with <unk> inc. an aircraft evaluation firm estimated the total <unk> value of the N planes at about $ N million or more 
 mr. ireland said N <unk> aircraft that pwa also said it plans to sell beginning in N have a current <unk> value of about $ N million each or a total $ N million raising <unk> potential proceeds from the aircraft sale to about $ N billion 
 mr. ireland said current demand for used aircraft is strong partly because surging orders for new aircraft have <unk> waiting lists 
 he predicted that pwa would have little difficulty attracting prospective buyers 
 under its revised fleet plan pwa said it will also increase its existing fleet of eight boeing <unk> aircraft to N by N and add four more boeing <unk> by N to the two units that it previously planned to add by next year 
 pwa said two of the boeing <unk> aircraft scheduled for delivery in N would be leased out for two to five years 
 pwa did n't disclose the expected net cost of the fleet overhaul but a toronto-based analyst estimated it at about $ N million us excluding replacement costs for the N <unk> aircraft that pwa plans to sell and purchase costs for as many as N airbus N aircraft that pwa previously ordered 
 i do n't see this as a debt reduction exercise 
 it 's focused on streamlining pwa 's fleet in a bid to cut training and aircraft <unk> costs the analyst said 
 pwa 's long-term debt and capital lease obligations rose to c$ N billion at the end of the second quarter nearly double the year-earlier figure reflecting debt absorbed under the <unk> purchase 
 pwa said it also expects to announce by tuesday whether it will take delivery of all N airbus N aircraft it previously ordered 
 the first five leased units were to be delivered in N 
 this british banking and financial-services group 's investment-banking arm barclays de zoete wedd group announced the following appointments at its <unk> subsidiary barclays de zoete wedd ltd

 the recent bids for united and american airlines have led congress to move with <unk> speed to protect incumbent airline <unk> 
 the house is scheduled to vote today on an <unk> bill that would block for up to N days any bid for N N or more of a u.s. airline even a straight cash purchase 
 transportation secretary sam skinner who earlier fueled the anti-takeover fires with his <unk> attacks on foreign investment in u.s. carriers now says the bill would further <unk> the jittery capital markets 
 texas rep. steve bartlett who has N american airlines workers in his district says the bill is good politics but bad law 
 it is ironic that at a time when america 's partial airline deregulation is being <unk> by governments from new zealand to ethiopia so many in congress favor an <unk> program for airlines that would be more appropriate for the soviet airline aeroflot 
 federal reserve chairman alan greenspan told congress that the fed can wipe out inflation without causing a recession but he said doing so will <unk> some short-term pain and will require reducing the federal deficit sharply 
 mr. greenspan said he and other fed governors <unk> a bill by rep. stephen neal d. n.c. that would require the fed to pursue policies aimed at eliminating inflation within five years 
 such a deadline is <unk> but it would have costs mr. greenspan told rep. neal 's monetary policy subcommittee 
 the fed chief opposed a bill introduced by <unk> lee hamilton d. ind. and <unk> <unk> d. <unk> that among other things would require the fed to disclose all monetary policy moves immediately and increase outside scrutiny of the fed 
 in responding to questions mr. greenspan played down reports of tension between the fed and the treasury over exchange-rate policy 
 what seem to be interpreted as great conflicts are relatively minor issues of tactics he said 
 he did n't elaborate 
 but the fed is n't enthusiastic about treasury efforts to bring down the value of the dollar through intervention in foreign-exchange markets and the treasury is frustrated at the fed 's reluctance to cut interest rates to pull down the dollar 's value 
 mr. greenspan said the inflation rate currently about N N N could be brought down to levels which are close to zero without putting the economy into a recession but i do suspect that there might be some modest loss of economic output 
 in other words economic growth would be lower and unemployment would be higher for a few years 
 but mr. greenspan who has repeatedly said the fed 's goal is to reduce inflation added that whatever losses are incurred in the pursuing of price stability would surely be more than made up in increased output thereafter 
 he warned that fed efforts to <unk> inflation would fail and could produce a major financial crunch unless they are accompanied by a significant reduction in the federal deficit which causes the government to borrow heavily 
 rep. neal 's bill originally called on the fed to reduce the inflation rate by one percentage point a year for five years and to maintain a zero inflation rate thereafter 
 he altered the <unk> to win mr. greenspan 's endorsement 
 even so his bill is given little chance of passage 
 <unk> hamilton and <unk> also have altered their bill dropping a proposal to add the treasury secretary to the <unk> fed committee that makes monetary policy 
 instead the bill simply calls for <unk> meetings between the committee and top administration officials 
 even that met with mr. greenspan 's <unk> because it might subject the fed to a more intensely political perspective and could risk <unk> monetary policy away from long-term strategic goals 
 while each of the <unk> proposals represents only a small step together they would erode the fed 's independence mr. greenspan said 
 mr. greenspan also said that although he favors cutting capital-gains taxes as sound economic policy he would oppose such a move if it would undo the political compromise <unk> in the tax reform act of N and result in higher marginal income tax rates 
 sears roebuck & co. signed a contract with bob vila the former host of the popular public television program this old house to star in a half-hour home improvement show sponsored by the giant retailer 
 the <unk> show slated to start airing by june N marks sears 's entry into the <unk> market of home repair television programs and could bolster sales of its home improvement products 
 in recent months sales of home improvement items have sagged along with sales of other big ticket durable goods 
 the show also signals mr. vila 's return as a television celebrity 
 earlier this year public television station <unk> in boston fired mr. vila after a sponsor <unk> some of his numerous commercial <unk> 
 with mr. vila as host this old house became one of the public broadcasting service 's top N programs airing weekly on about N of the network 's stations and seen by an average of N million viewers 
 but home <unk> inc. an atlanta-based home center chain <unk> when mr. vila started doing commercial <unk> for <unk> home centers a new jersey building supply company that competes with home <unk> in some markets 
 i 'm <unk> about the change said mr. vila whose new syndicated program is called home again with bob vila 
 in an interview mr. vila criticized his old show which is continuing with a new host 
 public tv is in fantasy land he said 
 last season we did a story that involved spending $ N in converting a <unk> house into a bed and breakfast 
 in the new show he said we 're going to spend $ N building a start-up house for a young couple 
 while sears would n't comment on the <unk> over mr. vila 's commercial <unk> it appears to be building a <unk> around mr. vila 's <unk> 
 his contract makes him exclusive spokesman for sears 's home improvement marketing campaigns 
 ogilvy & mather in chicago a unit of wpp group plc will handle the advertising account and <unk> 
 the only other endorsement permitted by the contract involves a series of <unk> home improvement and repair books 
 his other agreements to promote products have expired 
 little matter for mr. vila who complains that public tv never paid me more than $ N a year 
 he said his compensation under the sears contract is a <unk> dollar deal

 the white house has decided to push for changes in pesticide law that are designed to speed the removal of harmful chemicals from the nation 's food supply 
 the proposed changes which are scheduled to be announced today would apply to pesticides and other <unk> found on fresh and processed foods according to federal officials 
 environmental groups have been calling for faster action on dangerous pesticides and may welcome part of the proposal 
 but they are already <unk> to among other things a plan to give more weight to <unk> considerations in evaluating pesticides 
 it 's a tremendous disappointment said <unk> <unk> an attorney with the natural resources defense council 
 allowing the epa to <unk> continued use of a chemical whenever the benefits outweigh the risks is absolutely <unk> to the environmental community 
 the bush administration plans to announce a series of principles and to work with congressional leaders in writing specific legislative proposals that <unk> them 
 the principles would give the environmental protection agency increased authority and flexibility in <unk> pesticides with the aim of enabling the agency to move more quickly 
 there already are proposals pending in congress to overhaul pesticide law 
 moves to accelerate the removal of dangerous pesticides gained new impetus during this year 's <unk> scare when the epa was <unk> criticized for failing to <unk> the possible <unk> a growth regulator used to make apples <unk> and <unk> 
 the agency has since acted to remove <unk> from the nation 's grocery shelves by may N N and the apple industry has said that growers already have stopped using the chemical 
 in addition the principles attempt to eliminate the so-called <unk> <unk> 
 under the <unk> clause which applies to processed food a chemical is banned if it causes cancer in laboratory animals 
 under other laws applying to pesticide use however that same chemical could be allowed to be used on fresh food if it fell within the epa 's <unk> level 
 among other changes the white house wants to 
 give the epa more flexibility to declare a pesticide an imminent hazard and pull it from the marketplace 
 speed up the process for removing a pesticide that is n't an imminent hazard 
 bar states from setting more <unk> <unk> levels for a pesticide once the federal government has set a standard 
 give the epa added discretion to set negligible risk levels for pesticide <unk> in processed food 
 chemicals that exceed these risk levels would be barred but those that fall below these levels would be allowed 
 allow the epa to permit the continued use of pesticides that exceed its negligible risk standard if the benefits of doing so outweigh the cost 
 financial markets took a <unk> break from their recent wild gyrations with stock prices falling modestly bond prices posting tiny gains and the dollar almost unchanged 
 the dow jones industrial average lost N points to N in moderate trading 
 long-term treasury bonds rose slightly despite the <unk> on the market of $ N billion in 30-year bonds offered by the resolution funding corp. as part of the government 's bailout of the savings and loan industry 
 the dollar was barely changed against the west german mark and up marginally against the japanese yen 
 yesterday 's sluggish action was in marked contrast to the <unk> and plunging of stock prices tuesday after the proposed buy-out of ual corp. once again collapsed 
 traders said the stock market 's <unk> moves have prompted many investors to head for the sidelines until it <unk> some <unk> of stability 
 although bond prices were n't as volatile on tuesday trading as stock prices traders nevertheless said action also was much slower yesterday in the treasury market 
 bond investors paid close attention to comments by federal reserve chairman alan greenspan who was <unk> before a congressional hearing but were n't able to extract many clues about the future course of the fed 's monetary policy 
 many analysts are expecting the fed to lower interest rates at least once more before the end of the year 
 investors now are awaiting today 's release of the preliminary estimate of third-quarter gross national product 
 economists predict the report will show economic growth of about N N in the third quarter which would have little effect on financial markets 
 but an unexpected deviation either way could <unk> bond and currency markets 
 in major market activity 
 stock prices slipped lower in moderate trading 
 volume on the new york stock exchange totaled N million shares 
 but advancing issues on the big board were ahead of decliners N to N 
 bond prices inched higher 
 the treasury 's benchmark 30-year issue rose less than an eighth of a point or less than $ N for each $ N of face amount

 a few years ago i was on a panel of journalists that discussed the image of <unk> athletics for an audience of campus information directors and others 
 we <unk> quickly <unk> that not only was the bad rep of big-time college sports <unk> earned but also that it could be corrected 
 competition could be maintained and stadiums probably would remain full if schedules were reduced and the games returned to the students we said 
 comments from the audience reflected widespread if <unk> agreement with those conclusions 
 as the session broke up i was approached by a man who identified himself as the <unk> director of a big ten university 
 i 'd love to see sports cut back and so would a lot of my counterparts at other schools but everybody 's afraid to make the first move he <unk> 
 it 's like the u.s. and the russians nobody wants to <unk> first 
 and so our institutions of higher learning <unk> from scandal to scandal on <unk> and basketball court while the <unk> mount 
 three new books make the point that one large price of the <unk> <unk> show can be the integrity of the schools that stage it 
 they are a payroll to meet a story of greed corruption and football at <unk> macmillan N pages $ N by david <unk> big red confidential inside nebraska football contemporary N pages $ N by <unk> <unk> and never too young to die the death of <unk> bias <unk> N pages $ N by lewis <unk> 
 the pick of the group is payroll it should be required reading for every college president 
 it <unk> how over a period of a dozen years southern <unk> university bought its way to football respectability in the southwest conference only to find itself trapped and <unk> by the <unk> system it created 
 the school was the first in N to receive the ncaa 's death penalty two years without football for repeated rules violations 
 given current <unk> about the university of florida it may not be the last 
 the man who brought the bribe to the dallas school was ron <unk> a flashy sort who came in N to rescue a <unk> program mr. <unk> writes 
 mr. <unk> 's personal style was illustrated by his <unk> a $ N bill to a high-school <unk> board on which other coaches tacked their cards 
 one <unk> working with mr. <unk> was so generous with $ N and $ N bills that prospects sang here comes santa <unk> when he approached 
 paying players at <unk> was no casual operation 
 it involved the athletics director two different football <unk> staffs and school <unk> and governors just about everybody it seemed but donald <unk> the university 's president 
 there 's a <unk> passage in which mr. <unk> having finally learned of the practice <unk> his <unk> to bill <unk> then a university governor and now the governor of texas and oil man edwin cox chairman of the board of <unk> 
 you stay out of it author <unk> quotes mr. <unk> as saying 
 go run the university 
 which was about what mr. <unk> did and quietly until he resigned a few years later <unk> ill health when the stuff hit the fan 
 mr. <unk> drew on <unk> news media coverage of the <unk> scandal and on a university internal investigation 
 mr. <unk> had to do most of his own <unk> on university of nebraska football which is to date high and dry as far as the ncaa is concerned 
 unfortunately he gets low grades as an <unk> reporter relying heavily on what chicago 's late mayor richard j. <unk> called <unk> 
 discrepancies go <unk> in confidential one <unk> claims he received $ N to $ N for his season football tickets while others said theirs brought only a few hundred dollars and when mr. <unk> ca n't <unk> down something like who really owned a car driven by <unk> <unk> doug <unk> he simply <unk> his notes 
 there are <unk> <unk> to supposed romantic <unk> between <unk> players and a <unk> female university employee 
 a serious charge that star <unk> irving <unk> threw the N orange bowl game by intentionally dropping a pass in the end zone is included even though the nebraska assistant coach quoted denied making it 
 still the book produces more smoke than a <unk> <unk> along with a few <unk> especially concerning the use of <unk> 
 dean <unk> a <unk> <unk> former <unk> <unk> that he used <unk> and says other <unk> did too 
 it 's a mystery how this could have escaped the notice of nebraska coaches 
 probably it did n't 
 never too young is a different sort of work focusing on the N death from cocaine <unk> of bias a university of maryland basketball star <unk> for sure pro <unk> 
 while the university was no more to blame for that than for the similar fate of any other student it must bear responsibility for its conduct in the aftermath 
 bias 's coach <unk> <unk> ordered the room in which bias died to be <unk> before the police could arrive the order was n't carried out and the school 's athletics director issued false information about the academic standing of bias and other players 
 those of course were the responses of people with something to hide 
 one <unk> how other college athletic officials would <unk> under the same circumstances

 <unk> of north america inc. a unit of daimler-benz ag paid massachusetts $ N million in taxes bringing to an end a <unk> corporate tax chase 
 officials at the department of revenue had dogged the foreign car maker for taxes owed on business transactions and were proceeding to settle the dispute in court 
 but the check arrived in the mail said stephen kidder massachusetts commissioner of revenue 
 <unk> which had said it did n't owe taxes to massachusetts partly because it sells its cars at a <unk> in baltimore and not in massachusetts did n't explain its change of heart 
 last month <unk> executives approached state revenue officials complaining about bad press the commissioner said 
 the dispute was the subject of a wall street journal article in august 
 the amount covers taxes interest and penalties owed from N when the state began collecting corporate taxes to N

 <unk> van horn national convenience president and chief executive officer said the move reflects the company 's <unk> that the industry 's poor performance stems from its failure to give customers what they want rather than from increasing competition from gasoline stations and 24-hour grocery stores 
 convenience store merchandise has not kept pace with current trends in consumer preferences he said in a speech at the company 's annual shareholders meeting 
 analysts and competitors said the move reflects a growing need by the stores to expand their customer base beyond the traditional blue-collar worker who <unk> into a convenience store for a <unk> cigarettes soda or beer 
 there are an increasing number of people out there who are <unk> said chris <unk> retail analyst with alex brown & sons of baltimore 
 those are primarily white-collar workers a customer segment that has historically proved <unk> for convenience stores 
 national convenience 's move is likely to be <unk> by other chains though analysts note that <unk> corp. owner of <unk> stores and circle k corp. are too <unk> to roll out such an extensive effort 
 still <unk> said that its franchisees have been targeting their merchandise to their customers for years and that the company has begun to follow suit 
 for instance <unk> has expanded its bottled water selection in some stores and added fresh <unk> in some outlets 
 several months ago it also added black health and beauty aids displays to many stores a spokeswoman said 
 we certainly see an increasing trend toward that she added 
 national convenience said it has tested its new merchandise mix in N stores with favorable results 
 analysts said the company 's effort will be helped by its decision last year to put <unk> <unk> in N stores allowing national convenience to quickly track items that are selling and those that are n't 
 to promote its new strategy national convenience said it plans to spend about $ N million on advertising for the year ending june N up from about $ N million in fiscal N 
 labor secretary elizabeth dole named a mediator to help resolve the lengthy labor dispute between the united mine workers and pittston co 
 <unk> <unk> jr. labor secretary during the ford administration was named to <unk> talks to settle the six-month strike by the <unk> 
 previous talks between pittston of greenwich conn. and the union have been sporadic and unsuccessful

 one day after delmed inc. made top management changes and disclosed the end of an important business tie its stock did n't trade and the company forecast a significant drop next year in sales of its core product 
 that disclosure came a delmed spokeswoman said after the american stock exchange <unk> the company that trading would n't resume in its stock until additional information about developments was provided

 the spokeswoman said the exchange would resume trading of delmed stock today 
 delmed which makes and sells <unk> dialysis products used in treating kidney disease on tuesday announced the resignations of robert s. ehrlich chairman president and chief executive officer and of leslie i. shapiro chief operating officer and chief financial officer 
 they were succeeded by executives of fresenius usa inc. and its parent fresenius ag which owns about N N of delmed 
 at the same time the new <unk> n.j. company said negotiations about pricing and volumes of product had collapsed between it and its exclusive distributor in the u.s. national medical care inc 
 following that announcement tuesday however company officials were unavailable to elaborate 
 yesterday the spokeswoman said sales of delmed products through the exclusive arrangement with national medical accounted for N N of delmed 's N sales of $ N million 
 the current distribution arrangement ends in march N although delmed said it will continue to provide some supplies of the <unk> dialysis products to national medical the spokeswoman said 
 nonetheless delmed currently expects that N sales will be significantly below their N level the company said in a statement 
 delmed said yesterday that fresenius usa would begin distributing the product and that the company is investigating other possible distribution channels 
 in any case supplies to patients wo n't be interrupted the company added 
 fresenius a west german pharmaceutical concern has been discussing a transaction in which it would buy delmed stock for cash to bring its beneficial ownership to between N N and N N 
 the transaction also would combine fresenius usa and delmed 
 but the plan now is being <unk> delmed said declining to provide most of the new terms of the combination 
 said the spokeswoman the whole structure has changed 
 the value of the company has changed 
 delmed did say that the proposal still would <unk> cash into delmed but less than the $ N million originally expected 
 delmed also would receive the north american rights to certain fresenius ag products 
 another option for delmed the company said is that it could sell its plant in ogden utah 
 it added that no discussions about such a sale are under way 
 brooks <unk> car service inc. never wanted to get into money laundering 
 but july N a <unk> in wilmington del. caused <unk> creek to rise N feet pouring N million gallons of water into <unk> <unk> 
 the water destroyed about $ N million in currency and <unk> $ N million of coins with <unk> <unk> them dangerous to counting machines 
 the $ N million in paper money although <unk> <unk> and <unk> was exchanged through the federal reserve bank of philadelphia without incident 
 but brooks was unable to reach a <unk> agreement with the government 
 we kind of got caught between <unk> says president william f. brooks jr 
 the u.s. mint would n't take the coin because it was n't <unk> and the federal reserve bank <unk> only clean coins he says 
 the philadelphia fed says it is merely an agent for coins responsible only for storage and distribution 
 we issue paper money we destroy paper money says <unk> <unk> a philadelphia fed spokeswoman 
 the coin is their problem 
 a mint official says the agency offered to clean the coins for its <unk> cost of $ N plus certain other expenses 
 but brooks declined figuring that <unk> the <unk> up money to washington would cost the company thousands more 
 so brooks gave the <unk> work to coin wrap inc. which came up with an unusual solution 
 for eight hours a day for the past two weeks in aggregates of as much as N pounds equaling $ N in pennies coin wrap has been pouring money into a <unk> truck 
 a giant <unk> working like a <unk> causes the <unk> to <unk> and burns off any <unk> 
 after <unk> around for an hour or so the <unk> hot money <unk> out of the cement <unk> where a giant vacuum <unk> away the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> 
 after cooling the coins are then <unk> 
 brooks expects to pay coin wrap a total of about $ N a cost that insurance wo n't cover 
 and while the job is half done brooks is still bitter 
 in fact there 's only one person involved who 's happy and that 's <unk> string president of coin wrap and <unk> of the <unk> solution 
 not only did his company find $ N worth of work but when the approach was suggested mr. string says brooks officials did n't <unk> at me or anything 
 <unk> this summer 's successful and amusing movie about parents and children apparently was only the beginning 
 it seems that every day a new movie opens featuring a child coping with a mother 's death or adoption or aging parents or pregnancy 
 and why not 
 some of our best and most <unk> film makers from <unk> to <unk> to <unk> allen have taken a <unk> from <unk> when it comes to compelling drama there 's no place like home 
 yet too many people working in hollywood today seem to suffer from the <unk> that the drama played out in every home will be interesting to people who live somewhere else 
 this is not the case 
 some <unk> simply are n't worth <unk> in 
 yet there will be people who will <unk> at immediate family a <unk> constructed and offensive movie about adoption 
 these are the sensitive <unk> who can <unk> with and even enjoy hearing about other people 's troubles no matter how <unk> or predictably the sad tale is told 
 written by barbara <unk> co-author of the big <unk> immediate family takes the position that only rich people living in nice houses should have children 
 the film makers have <unk> this offensive idea in pretty packaging 
 everyone is very nice and <unk> the <unk> parents glenn close and james woods and the <unk> couple who decide to give up their baby for adoption mary stuart <unk> and kevin dillon 
 linda and michael ms. close and mr. woods who seem to be pushing N live in a large and <unk> <unk> home in suburban seattle 
 all of their friends have children and they ca n't so now they want a child more than anything perhaps even more than michael wanted his fancy convertible or his <unk> stereo equipment 
 the idea of a <unk> must be <unk> them since the wealthy <unk> of their friends are shown to be <unk> <unk> in therapy by age five 
 having exhausted all modern aids to <unk> linda and michael decide to adopt 
 the actors wear <unk> <unk> to indicate their genuine <unk> for a little one or maybe they 're <unk> commenting on the <unk> of the script and jonathan <unk> 's the accused <unk> direction 
 or maybe they are <unk> by the <unk> musical score when a character <unk> at a major decision her thoughts are revealed by the sound of i can see clearly now 
 the adoption agency insists on introducing the adopting parents to the birth mother so linda and michael pay for pregnant <unk> 's ms. <unk> bus ticket from ohio 
 why in these movies is the <unk> pregnant woman always from ohio 
 i ask this not necessarily as a native <unk> 
 <unk> of course is pretty and smart though <unk> 
 everyone falls in love with everyone else 
 there is some pain when <unk> has the baby and did n't know she would feel like this and wants to keep the baby 
 but in the end everything turns out for the best in the film makers ' <unk> view 
 like lawyers in the hostile takeover field the baby goes where the money is 
 at the other end of the life cycle is <unk> gary david goldberg 's <unk> of the william <unk> novel 
 this picture is about a <unk> son who makes sure that his delayed bond with his father will last by waiting to cement it until just before the old man dies 
 the <unk> emotional style mr. goldberg has <unk> on television 's family ties does n't benefit from <unk> 
 his characters practically <unk> through a vast range of human <unk> like travelers doing N cities in eight days 
 they <unk> only to register little <unk> of <unk> and <unk> of satisfaction like tourists <unk> the sights they 've seen from the window of a bus 
 not even jack <unk> 's expert <unk> makes this trip worth taking 
 so it 's entirely possible that look who 's talking is n't as entertaining as it seems in comparison to the <unk> other films opening now 
 but by comparison this <unk> comedy seems like a <unk> 
 it starts with conception taking the <unk> 's point of view then <unk> to the baby 's point of view 
 bruce <unk> 's best attribute as an actor is his <unk> <unk> voice and that 's all you get of him here speaking for the baby 
 finally there is one family movie that quite <unk> <unk> the <unk> of human <unk> only its stars are bears 
 for the second time in a movie called the bear french director <unk> <unk> demonstrates just how powerful pictures can be 
 <unk> for fire was the first time 
 to be sure one <unk> what kind of man is this who feels <unk> to try to understand the most <unk> <unk> and <unk> in a way that requires the most sophisticated appreciation of <unk> <unk> 
 supposedly he proposed the movie to his producer <unk> <unk> in four lines 
 an <unk> bear <unk> 
 a big <unk> bear 
 two <unk> in the forest 
 the animals ' point of view 
 but then even a great many words could n't <unk> the extraordinary pull of this movie about an <unk> bear who <unk> a parent 
 video tip 
 one of the best movies about the <unk> thing in recent years was raising arizona the N <unk> brothers ' comedy that definitely was not about the folks next door 
 westinghouse electric corp. <unk> on a major restructuring program expects operating margins of more than N N and double-digit per-share earnings growth next year top officers told securities analysts here 
 john c. marous chairman and chief executive officer also said the company expects sales from continuing businesses to rise N N annually through the next three years 
 in N the company earned $ N million or $ N a share on sales of $ N billion 
 since N westinghouse has shed N businesses that it did n't expect to produce N N operating margins while acquiring N businesses 
 in the past N months alone paul e. <unk> president and chief operating officer said the divestiture of $ N million of <unk> <unk> businesses has been more than offset by $ N million in profitable acquisitions 
 westinghouse expects to meet its corporate goals despite a softening in the economy 
 even if the gross national product is either flat or in the growth range of N N to N N we can handle that mr. marous said 
 gnp is the total value of the nation 's output of goods and services 
 a bright spot is the company 's <unk> business which is experiencing a surge of growth for the first time in years 
 mr. marous said the business will achieve higher sales this year than the company 's target goal of N N 
 while westinghouse has n't had a nuclear power plant order from a u.s. utility in about a decade excess capacity is beginning to shrink 
 mr. <unk> said the company <unk> the need for a major boost in <unk> capability throughout the 1990s 
 westinghouse also is well positioned to sell steam <unk> and gas <unk> plants to independent power producers 
 the company 's ability to respond to energy needs world-wide will be enhanced through a recently announced venture with mitsubishi heavy industries mr. <unk> said 
 he said the independent power segment could grow to provide as much as N N of near-term generation capacity adding we expect to supply a significant share of this market 
 westinghouse also expects its international sales to soon grow to N N of total corporate sales from N N last year 
 the company is negotiating with the soviets to build a <unk> king <unk> plant that would produce about N units annually 
 mr. marous said westinghouse would own N N of the facility 
 the deal which will involve an initial $ N million investment was struck with a <unk> he added 
 company officials also said that any gain from the sale of westinghouse 's N N stake in its transmission and distribution venture with the swiss firm of asea brown boveri will be offset by a restructuring charge in the fourth quarter 
 the executives did n't disclose the size of the expected gain 
 capital expenditure in N will rise slightly mr. marous said from an estimated $ N million this year 
 short interest in international mobile machines corp. fell to N shares in the month ended oct. N from N in september 
 because of an error by the national association of securities dealers the listing appeared incorrectly in the main table and several highlight tables in yesterday 's edition 
 a proposed <unk> policy for federally funded <unk> researchers may thwart many high-technology new ventures say financiers researchers and university administrators 
 the national institutes of health policy would require researchers to cut financial ties with health-care businesses or lose their government money 
 among other concerns the agency says researchers with business ties are more likely to <unk> findings in order to <unk> new drugs 
 as ties between <unk> and venture capital have <unk> in recent years <unk> fear of abuse has risen 
 but the guidelines could make it impossible to <unk> research says kenneth smith associate <unk> and vice president for research at massachusetts institute of technology 
 the nih is asking grant recipients and others for comments on the proposed guidelines until dec. N 
 after that it will make a final decision on the policy 
 the guidelines could <unk> future arrangements similar to the deal behind <unk> inc. a <unk> mass. start-up says robert daly a managing partner of <unk> associates a venture-capital firm 
 with $ N million he and other investors launched <unk> last year to market a <unk> cure being developed by researchers of the university of california at san diego 
 the researchers who are being financed by the <unk> funds will receive a royalty or percentage of sales if their research yields a commercial product 
 but because the university of california like many other universities shares its royalties with researchers it may <unk> itself from federal funds under the proposed guidelines mr. daly says 
 the high-tech industry is full of the kind of arrangement that the new guidelines would affect 
 for instance commonwealth <unk> inc. a venture-capital concern last month invested $ N to launch <unk> inc. a <unk> mass. concern that will produce pharmaceuticals 
 scientists <unk> <unk> and paul <unk> conducted the initial research at the massachusetts institute of technology 
 while ms. <unk> left mit to head <unk> prof. <unk> will continue to work at mit serve on <unk> 's board and own a small equity stake in the company 
 the <unk> transaction is typical of the way venture-capital firms are approaching the task of <unk> biotechnology research 
 while universities develop the basic research venture capitalists are the ones best positioned to finance its <unk> says <unk> w. <unk> of commonwealth 
 this is the best way to transfer technology straight off the <unk> of universities 
 but the new guidelines could prevent scientists like prof. <unk> from being involved with <unk> such as <unk> venture capitalists point out 
 and if that happens the entire process of <unk> technology to the marketplace could be <unk> they say 
 the stakes in the controversy are large 
 last year venture capitalists spent an estimated $ N million to finance start-up companies in medical and biotechnology businesses according to the national venture capital association a trade group 
 many of the deals involved transactions in which scientific institutions or researchers agreed to <unk> their work in return for an equity stake or royalties 
 in many of these deals venture capitalists had the inside track says lawrence <unk> of <unk> ventures la jolla calif 
 investors were willing to gamble on new technologies because we had exclusive rights to those technologies he adds 
 but under the proposed guidelines all federally funded research will have to be reported publicly so that anyone can capitalize on the work 
 without the exclusivity most venture capitalists wo n't have the incentive to invest in such deals mr. <unk> says 
 last year for example <unk> and others invested $ N million in <unk> <unk> inc. south san francisco calif. to license and develop technology for delivery of drugs to the brain 
 but before <unk> was able to get an exclusive license to the technology the federal register published most of the details giving all of the company 's potential competitors a chance to exploit it mr. <unk> says 
 <unk> eventually acquired exclusive rights to the technology and currently is developing it 
 but says mr. <unk> it was a close call 
 the proposed guidelines could also delay <unk> and force small companies to waste scarce capital entrepreneurs say 
 if <unk> ca n't have early access to research being conducted at institutions we have to <unk> it ourselves or do without the research says ruth <unk> manager of business development at applied biotechnology inc. a cambridge mass. concern 
 <unk> research is both costly and <unk> for a start-up ms. <unk> says 
 for its part nih insists that its guidelines should not <unk> research creativity or technology transfer from the research laboratory to commercial use 
 universities such as harvard and mit should be able to develop a way to act as brokers for the individual scientists says <unk> <unk> who oversees the huge nih grants program as its deputy director for <unk> research 
 nih staff members believe the guidelines are essential to prevent the <unk> of problems that have already begun to surface in scientific ventures 
 not long ago scientists holding stock in <unk> pharmaceutical services inc. were accused of <unk> research to boost the stock 
 many officials are also concerned about companies getting a free ride on <unk> research 
 a congressional <unk> has been investigating the potential abuse from researchers holding stock in companies <unk> their research 
 among other provisions the nih guidelines would prohibit researchers and members of their immediate families from holding stock in any company that is affected by the outcome of their research 
 ms. <unk> the nih administrator says the business and scientific community is <unk> to what the agency merely meant to be ideas for discussion 
 the predictions of <unk> are <unk> she says 
 but when agencies like the nih <unk> guidelines they 've often already <unk> policy veteran scientists say 
 indeed institutions already are taking note 
 on sept. N harvard began circulating a <unk> policy statement that in effect would follow the nih guidelines <unk> 
 the university of california at san francisco is also circulating a memo among its scientific faculty that will restrict contact with the world of business 
 in many other institutions scientists are <unk> contacts with venture investors until the nih policy is settled 
 says mr. daly the venture capitalist it does n't matter whether they call it guidelines or policy 
 the damage is already done

 merksamer jewelers inc. a fast-growing jewelry store chain filed for chapter N bankruptcy-law protection from creditors apparently to speed a management buy-out of the chain 
 the filing made yesterday in u.s. bankruptcy court here follows an agreement by l.j. hooker corp. merksamer 's owner to sell the chain to management for an undisclosed price 
 ge capital corp. a financial services subsidiary of general electric co. is providing merksamer management with $ N million in financing 
 l.j. hooker based in atlanta filed for chapter N protection in august and has also announced its intention to sell its b. altman & co. department store chain 
 l.j. hooker is owned by hooker corp. sydney australia which itself is currently being managed by a court-appointed provisional <unk> 
 l.j. hooker 's planned sale of merksamer is subject to approval by judge <unk> <unk> of u.s. bankruptcy court 
 rumors to the effect that the merksamer chain would file for chapter N arose last week in the jewelry industry 
 at that time sam merksamer president of the chain <unk> denied that his company was about to file 
 mr. merksamer is leading the buy-out 
 according to executives close to the situation merksamer filed for chapter N to speed the sale of the chain 
 one executive said an accord signed by the unsecured creditors of l.j. hooker corp. had frozen in place all of l.j. hooker 's assets 
 the merksamer bankruptcy-law filing appears to <unk> that agreement 
 by filing for chapter N the merksamer chain will only need approval from a bankruptcy judge for the sale not the hundreds of unsecured creditors said this executive 
 the cash from the sale will go to l.j. hooker but the company itself will belong to sam merksamer 
 mr. merksamer and sanford <unk> chief executive of l.j. hooker were unavailable for comment 
 in a statement mr. merksamer described the filing as a legal <unk> but also said that our inability to obtain trade credit combined with a need to ensure that our stores were properly <unk> for the christmas season <unk> our filing chapter N 
 the jewelry chain which is based in sacramento calif. had revenue of $ N million and operating profit of $ N million for the year ended june N 
 for all of this year 's explosive <unk> in stock prices renaissance investment management inc. 's computer sat on the sidelines 
 now it 's on the <unk> 
 renaissance a <unk> money manager began buying stocks again this week with half of the $ N billion that it oversees for clients according to people familiar with the firm 's revised strategy 
 it was the first time since january that renaissance has thought stocks are worth owning 
 renaissance declined to confirm the move but its stock purchases were thought to have begun tuesday <unk> to <unk> with the maturity this week of treasury bills owned by the firm 
 the other half of its portfolio is expected to remain invested in treasury bills for the time being 
 wall street executives said they believed that renaissance 's $ N million buy program was carried out by painewebber inc 
 as reported painewebber bought shares tuesday as part of a customer strategy shift although the broker 's client was said then to have been japanese 
 yesterday painewebber declined comment 
 when it owns stocks renaissance 's portfolio typically is composed of about N <unk> issues to make buy or sell moves the firm <unk> wall street brokerage houses a day or so in advance looking for the best package price to carry out the trades 
 the broker winning the business does n't charge commissions but instead profits by buying or selling for less than the overall package price 
 that puts the broker at risk if it 's trying to buy stock in a rising market 
 in tuesday 's <unk> session the dow jones industrial average fell by N points early in the day but finished with less than a <unk> loss 
 renaissance 's last portfolio shift carried out by goldman sachs & co. was a highly publicized decision last january to sell its entire stock portfolio and buy treasury bills 
 the sell signal which sent a bearish <unk> through the stock market came when renaissance 's computer found that stocks were <unk> compared with bonds and treasury bills 
 at the time the dow jones industrial average stood at about N 
 the dow average now stands more than N N higher while renaissance 's portfolio of treasurys produced a return of about N N through the first three quarters of the year 
 the computer 's <unk> has been painful for renaissance 
 almost any money manager holding stocks has turned in better results while renaissance has played it safe with treasury bills 
 so why does renaissance 's computer like stocks with the dow at N where it closed yesterday when it did n't with the dow at N 
 with the decline in stock prices and continued low or stable interest rates stocks are representing a better value all the time renaissance president frank w. <unk> said yesterday 
 three-month <unk> yields have fallen to N N from about N N at the start of the year 
 stock prices meanwhile are about N points lower than the peak of N reached on the dow industrial average oct. N 
 are those declines enough to signal a partial return to stocks 
 mr. <unk> wo n't say specifically explaining that if there was such a move it would take about three days to complete the loose ends of the transaction 
 during that time a buyer with the clout of a renaissance could end up driving up the price of stocks it was trying to buy if it <unk> its hand 
 but everything is relative to mr. <unk> so stocks in his view can become more attractive in comparison with bonds or <unk> even if shares are more expensive than when they were sold in january 
 our computer model has a certain trigger point he said 
 when the computer says switch renaissance switches 
 the firm has made N previous shifts from one type of asset to another in its 10-year history 
 almost all have involved at least half and often the firm 's entire portfolio as the computer searches for the most undervalued investment category following a <unk> style called tactical asset allocation 
 competing <unk> firms march to their own computer models so some have been partly or fully invested in stocks this year while renaissance has sat on the sidelines 
 as a result competitors say renaissance has been looking for any opportunity to return to the stock market rather than risk losing business by continuing to remain fully invested in treasury bills 
 mr. <unk> confirms some clients have left renaissance but no major ones and the firm has added new accounts 
 david evans who last week resigned as president and chief executive of qintex entertainment inc. for personal reasons just as the company filed for bankruptcy-law protection has been temporarily <unk> to both positions the company said 
 qintex entertainment also said chief financial officer and treasurer jonathan lloyd N years old would join the <unk> board 
 he succeeds roger <unk> who resigned last week saying his participation in evaluating the company 's role in buying mgm\/ua communications co. was no longer necessary 
 mr. evans will stay until a successor is found but not later than the end of the year the company said 
 it was the <unk> mr. evans who had moved into the offices of mgm\/ua and run the company during qintex australia ltd. 's aborted bid for the movie company 
 after mgm\/ua terminated the $ N billion merger because of a dispute over a $ N million letter of credit qintex entertainment which is <unk> by qintex australia found itself facing problems of its own 
 and the relationship between qintex entertainment and the australian company appears to be quickly deteriorating 
 on oct. N qintex entertainment was about to default on a $ N million payment owed to mca inc. in connection with the distribution of a television program 
 qintex entertainment was depending on qintex australia to arrange financing 
 but early on oct. N the second of two hectic days of board meetings mr. evans said he believed qintex australia would n't be <unk> 
 he recommended that the company file for protection under chapter N of the u.s. bankruptcy code before the mca deadline according to a source familiar with the sessions 
 but a majority of the board which includes three members from the australian company <unk> him 
 mr. evans resigned 
 later in the day according to the source the board reversed itself decided to file for bankruptcy protection and asked mr. evans to stay on 
 mr. evans told the board he needed the weekend to think about it 
 mr. evans could n't be reached yesterday for comment 
 last monday qintex australia announced a restructuring plan and said it would sell off assets 
 last week the company indicated it would cut back on the working capital it would supply to qintex entertainment 
 separately a qintex entertainment shareholder filed suit in federal court in los angeles charging qintex australia with misleading shareholders about qintex entertainment 's financial position 
 qintex australia said it had n't seen the suit and could n't comment 
 the sept. N tracking travel column advises readers to charge with caution when traveling abroad because credit-card companies charge N N to convert foreign-currency expenditures into dollars 
 in fact this is the best bargain available to someone traveling abroad 
 in contrast to the N N conversion fee charged by visa foreign-currency dealers routinely charge N N or more to convert u.s. dollars into foreign currency 
 on top of this the <unk> who <unk> his dollars into foreign currency before the trip starts will lose interest from the day of conversion 
 at the end of the trip any <unk> foreign exchange will have to be converted back into dollars with another commission due 
 the card holder will pay the modest N N fee only on the amounts actually needed 
 typically he will be billed only several weeks after the expenditure and then has another couple of weeks before he has to pay the bill 
 in the meantime the money can continue to earn interest for the card holder often more than N N during that float period alone

 of the total purchase price $ N million cash and $ N million in stock nearly N million shares would be paid to buy the existing <unk> marina hotel & casino from southwest securities a nevada limited partnership 
 the remaining properties to be acquired are the <unk> country club & golf course a facility jointly owned by ramada inc. of phoenix ariz. and the <unk> family and a small parcel owned by mgm grand director james d. <unk> 
 the purchase price was disclosed in a preliminary prospectus issued in connection with mgm grand 's planned offering of six million common shares 
 the luxury airline and casino company <unk> by investor kirk <unk> and his <unk> corp. earlier this month announced its agreements to acquire the properties but did n't disclose the purchase price 
 the proposed stock offering and issuance of nearly N million common shares in connection with the land purchase will bring mgm grand 's total shares outstanding to N million of which N N will be owned by mr. <unk> and <unk> according to the prospectus 
 in over-the-counter trading mgm grand was bid at $ N a share 
 proceeds from the offering are expected to be used for remodeling the company 's desert <unk> resort in las vegas <unk> certain aircraft of the mgm grand air unit and to acquire the property for the new resort 
 the company said it estimates the desert <unk> remodeling will cost about $ N million and the <unk> of the three <unk> aircraft made by mcdonnell douglas corp. will cost around $ N million 
 mgm grand said the latest stock offering wo n't cover the $ N million or more cost of building the proposed resort and theme park and added it will need to seek additional financing either through bank borrowings or debt and equity offerings at a later date 
 construction is set to begin in early N 
 the resort will include the mgm grand hotel a <unk> <unk> facility that will include N rooms and N square feet of casino space 
 the facility will be marketed toward families and room rates will be between $ N and $ N a night mgm grand said 
 the prospectus did n't include many details about the studio and theme park although conceptual drawings released this month show that it may feature several <unk> areas similar to those found at parks built by walt disney co 
 investors poured $ N billion more into money-market mutual funds in the latest week despite further declines in yields 
 assets of the N taxable funds tracked by <unk> 's money fund report jumped to $ N billion in the week ended tuesday the <unk> <unk> newsletter said 
 assets soared $ N billion in the previous week 
 meanwhile the average yield on taxable funds dropped nearly a <unk> of a percentage point the largest drop since <unk> 
 the average seven-day compound yield which assumes that dividends are reinvested and that current rates continue for a year fell to N N its lowest since late last year from N N the week before according to donoghue 's 
 lower yields are just reflecting lower short-term interest rates said <unk> <unk> <unk> editor of money fund report 
 money funds invest in such things as short-term treasury securities commercial paper and certificates of deposit all of which have been posting lower interest rates since last spring 
 individual investors can still get better yields on money funds than on many other short-term instruments 
 the yield on six-month treasury bills sold at monday 's auction for example was just N N 
 the average yield on six-month cds of $ N or less at major banks was N N in the week ended tuesday according to banxquote money markets a new york information service 
 one way that money fund managers boost yields in a declining rate environment is by extending the maturities of their investments so they can earn the current higher rates for a longer period 
 the average maturity of the taxable funds that donoghue 's follows increased by two days in the latest week to N days its longest since august 
 they 're anticipating further declines in rates and they 're going to get them slowly said walter frank chief economist for the donoghue organization publisher of money fund report 
 average maturity was as short as N days at the start of this year when short-term interest rates were moving steadily upward 
 the average seven-day compound yield of the funds reached N N in late april 
 the <unk> funds are still above N N 
 the <unk> fund in the latest week was dreyfus worldwide dollar with a seven-day compound yield of N N 
 the fund invests heavily in dollar-denominated money-market securities overseas 
 it is currently <unk> management fees which <unk> to the higher yield 
 the average seven-day simple yield of the N funds fell to N N from N N donoghue 's reported 
 the average 30-day simple yield slid to N N from N N and the average 30-day compound yield fell to N N from N N 
 many small investors are facing a double <unk> this year they got hurt by investing in the highly risky junk bond market and the pain is worse because they did it with borrowed money 
 these people invested in leveraged junk bond mutual funds the publicly traded funds that make a habit of taking out loans to buy extra junk 
 it 's a good strategy in a rising market where a N N leveraged portfolio in effect allows investors to have N N of their money working for them 
 the strategy boosts current yield by putting more bonds into the portfolio 
 trouble is junk bond prices have been weak for months 
 thus the leverage has <unk> the funds ' portfolio losses 
 and shares of leveraged junk funds this year have been clobbered even harder than the junk bonds they hold 
 that 's really where the leverage hurt says thomas <unk> a miami-based investment manager who specializes in closed-end funds 
 share prices performed even worse than the funds ' asset values because fear has taken hold in the junk market he says 
 leverage is never a problem for the traditional open end mutual funds which are n't publicly traded and are n't allowed to use leverage at all 
 leverage is used only by some of the closed-end funds 
 the usual maneuver is to borrow against the portfolio value or issue preferred stock using the proceeds to buy additional bonds 
 the fallout for investors lately has been painful 
 consider the new america high income fund 
 with a leveraged position of about N N the fund 's share price has plunged N N so far this year 
 that 's worse than the price drop sustained by the bonds in its portfolio whose total return <unk> changes plus interest has amounted to a negative N N 
 such problems may not be over 
 leveraged funds in particular are still extremely vulnerable because we 're still at the beginning of problems in the junk market says george foot a managing partner at <unk> management associates in <unk> mass 
 many investors are <unk> their funds have borrowed to speculate in such a risky market 
 if someone actually sat down and thought about what they were being sold says gerald <unk> editor of the mutual fund letter in chicago they might shy away 
 in a typical leverage strategy a fund tries to capture the spread between what it costs to borrow and the higher return on the bonds it buys with the borrowed money 
 if the market <unk> holders can make that much more profit the leverage effectively acts as an <unk> margin account for investors 
 but when the market moves against the fund investors lose more than other junk holders because the market decline is magnified by the amount the fund is leveraged 
 fund managers for their part defend their use of leverage 
 carl <unk> who runs the colonial intermediate high income fund says the fund 's N N leverage has <unk> up its interest income 
 as long as i am borrowing at N N and each bond yields over that it <unk> the yield he maintains 
 mr. <unk> says he tries to offset the leverage by diversifying the fund 's portfolio 
 yet some funds have pulled in their <unk> 
 new america high income fund recently said that it plans to reduce its leverage position by buying back $ N million in preferred stock and notes from investors 
 the fund made a similar move earlier this year 
 we are trying to increase our flexibility says <unk> e. terry a vice president at <unk> capital management the fund 's investment adviser 
 she declined to elaborate and would n't disclose the fund 's recent purchases sales or cash position 
 ms. terry did say the fund 's recent performance illustrates what happens in a leveraged product when the market does n't cooperate 
 when the market turns around she says it will give a nice picture of how leverage can help performance 
 several leveraged funds do n't want to cut the amount they borrow because it would slash the income they pay shareholders fund officials said 
 but a few funds have taken other defensive steps 
 some have raised their cash positions to record levels 
 high cash positions help buffer a fund when the market falls 
 prospect street high income portfolio for instance now holds about N N in cash and equivalents nearly <unk> the amount it held earlier this year says john <unk> portfolio <unk> 
 he says the fund which is N N leveraged has maintained a substantial cushion between its borrowing costs and the yields of the portfolio 's bonds 
 i do n't want to be in a position to have to sell mr. <unk> says 
 other funds have recently sold weak junk bonds to raise cash 
 at the <unk> zenith income fund portfolio manager john <unk> recently dumped mesa petroleum <unk> and <unk> industries among others to raise his cash position to a record N N 
 that 's a problem because cash is n't earning us very much money mr. <unk> says 
 he concedes this is the most difficult market that i 've been involved in 
 because of the recent <unk> turmoil the fund is considering investing in other issues instead including mortgage-backed bonds 
 we 're looking at the leverage factor every day says robert moore president of <unk> inc. a shearson lehman hutton inc. unit and the fund 's adviser 
 at some point if we are unable to cover our leveraged cost and at the moment we 're right on it we 're going to have to make a move 
 one of the more bizarre garden stories since <unk> has been <unk> for four years now in the private <unk> <unk> of artist <unk> bartlett 
 and if she and the battery park city authority have their way her <unk> <unk> plan will soon go public as a real garden <unk> in the downtown complex 
 south gardens as the bartlett scheme is called will <unk> the last N acres of open space at the southwest tip of manhattan 
 it could cost taxpayers $ N million to install and <unk> residents $ N million a year to maintain 
 created by an artist who <unk> her ignorance of plants and gardens south gardens as now planned will die from <unk> garden design 
 ms. bartlett 's previous work which earned her an international reputation in the <unk> art world often took gardens as its nominal subject 
 <unk> this <unk> connection made the <unk> fine arts committee think she had a <unk> green <unk> 
 ms. bartlett would not discuss her garden for this article 
 last year she <unk> to <unk> magazine i 'd never looked at a garden in my life 
 and she proved no <unk> <unk> in her initial statement to the bpca a new york state public benefit corporation the only thing i was interested in doing was a very complicated garden which would cost an enormous amount of money and be very expensive to maintain 
 <unk> the bpca hired ms. bartlett and another confessed garden <unk> the architect alexander <unk> who claimed he had never visited much less built a garden and said of the project i do n't view this as a landscape 
 i view this as a building 
 the third principal in the south gardens <unk> did have garden experience 
 the firm of bruce <unk> <unk> landscape architects had created central park 's <unk> fields and shakespeare garden 
 the bpca called its team a stunning collaboration 
 after four years though the south gardens design is N N <unk> <unk> bartlett 
 she has done little more than <unk> her standard <unk> trees water landscape <unk> <unk> square houses circles <unk> <unk> and fit them into a grid as if she were making one of her <unk> <unk> works for a gallery wall 
 but for south gardens the grid was to be a <unk> network of <unk> or hedge walls with real plants inside them 
 in a letter to the bpca <unk> called this <unk> and <unk> 
 the landscape architects were expelled from the garden in july 
 all the while ms. bartlett had been busy at her <unk> <unk> in her sense of <unk> 
 as she put it in a N <unk> at the harvard graduate school of design i have designed a garden not knowing the difference between a <unk> and a <unk> 
 moreover she proclaimed that landscape architects have been going wrong for the last N years in the design of open space 
 and she further stunned her <unk> by <unk> her secret garden design method <unk> a friend to spend five or six thousand dollars on books that i ultimately cut up 
 after that the <unk> had been easy 
 i 've always relied heavily on the grid and found it never to fail 
 ms. bartlett told her audience that she absolutely did not believe in compromise or in giving in to the client because i do n't think you can do <unk> versions of things 
 this was never a problem with south gardens because the client had long since given in to ms. bartlett 's every <unk> 
 last year the public was <unk> a <unk> of ms. bartlett 's creation in a <unk> version at a <unk> exhibition 
 the labels were <unk> within its <unk> walls is a <unk> of a thousand years in garden design a rose garden <unk> garden <unk> garden <unk> fields an apple <unk> organized in a <unk> of <unk> <unk> to form rooms here and there are simple architectural forms a <unk> jet of water a <unk> of topiary or <unk> <unk> and chairs of every sort to drag around 
 at the core of it all is a love for plants 
 plant <unk> who studied the <unk> were alarmed 
 they looked at the <unk> and saw a giant <unk> 
 ms. bartlett 's little rooms left little room for plants or people 
 <unk> had put south gardens ' carrying capacity at four people per room or about N humans overall 
 this <unk> of tiny <unk> <unk> was inspired by the artist 's own digs my <unk> was N by N feet so N feet by N feet seemed like a good garden room 
 inside the grid were N of these plant cells <unk> full of clutter 
 one she made into a topiary <unk> room <unk> with plants <unk> into a <unk> tv piano and chairs 
 in another she <unk> topiary <unk> missile <unk> costing $ N each in heights up to N feet 
 another she <unk> with eight <unk> hedges for a topiary <unk> lesson in the <unk> of plants 
 in the <unk> <unk> she specified a <unk> <unk> garden <unk> 
 she ordered the <unk> done in a different <unk> <unk> and made the landscape architects study a book on <unk> 
 in one garden <unk> she <unk> a <unk> square glass <unk> meant to show off a <unk> <unk> floor <unk> a <unk> sink a huge <unk> with <unk> and a <unk> with <unk> 
 next door she put a smaller <unk> glass house where she suggested a flat of <unk> might be displayed in the dead of winter 
 in another <unk> called the <unk> <unk> N <unk> trees were to be crowded together at killing <unk> of N or N feet 
 <unk> need about N feet 
 one thing about the bartlett plan was never in doubt it would demand the full-time skills of a <unk> of topiary <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> 
 ms. bartlett <unk> suggested calling upon <unk> garden club workers for maintenance 
 furthermore she had insisted on <unk> so narrow five to eight feet and hedge corners so square that standard maintenance equipment trucks or cherry pickers could n't maneuver 
 then to make these <unk> quite literally rooms ms. bartlett had thrown up <unk> walls brick <unk> hedge eight to N feet tall casting her <unk> into <unk> <unk> <unk> 
 it was hard to see how <unk> would ever happen in south gardens without <unk> the walls in a <unk> array of <unk> 
 finally <unk> the bpca 's wishes to continue the popular <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for its <unk> views of new york harbor the <unk> of liberty and ellis island ms. bartlett threw up yet another wall this time concrete this time N N feet tall 
 she ran it the length of the south gardens <unk> <unk> out the city 's great natural water features the harbor and the river 
 within her garden she has <unk> a <unk> a <unk> <unk> and other costly <unk> waterworks <unk> the hudson 
 while the model was still on view manhattan community board N passed a resolution against south gardens 
 the parks council wrote the bpca that this too private exclusive complex and expensive <unk> garden belongs in almost any location but the <unk> 
 <unk> b. miller the noted public garden designer who restored central park 's <unk> garden recalls her reaction to the south gardens model in light of the public garden she was designing for <unk> street 's bryant park bryant park as designed in N failed as a public space because it made people feel trapped 
 by removing the hedges and some walls the bryant park restoration is opening it up 
 it seems to me the bpca plan has the potential of making south gardens a <unk> jail for people and plants 
 the three urban <unk> experts with cornell cooperative extension weighed in with a letter to the bpca that began we feel that the garden is <unk> doomed 
 they then addressed the <unk> questionable safety of a complex garden of endless <unk> places 
 the N <unk> hedges which <unk> views in and out of small rooms insure that this garden will be a potential breeding ground for crime 
 at harvard ms. bartlett had declared there are going to be problems with safety 
 i 'm not going to address questions of safety 
 despite the dire <unk> of knowledgeable garden professionals ms. bartlett 's south gardens design somehow continues on seemingly <unk> to reason stalled only by bureaucratic <unk> and <unk> <unk> 
 bpca president and ceo david <unk> hopes to negotiate a <unk> that could be significantly more <unk> <unk> 
 and by <unk> yet another landscape architect nicholas <unk> he insists he can achieve that and other <unk> to <unk> reality while still preserving the artistic vision of a truly great artist 
 after four years of no progress in this direction it is doubtful any viable collaboration with ms. bartlett will suddenly now be possible 
 mr. <unk> has said he plans to go with the grid regardless 
 there is still time however for gov. mario <unk> or <unk> <unk> chairman of the bpca board to prevent this topiary <unk> <unk> 
 these <unk> might take counsel from william robinson author of the english <unk> garden the <unk> 's <unk> since N who seems to have had a <unk> bartlett in mind when he wrote <unk> our <unk> for ages have suffered at the hands of the <unk> artist when applying his designs to the garden 
 it is this <unk> of absurd <unk> ' and patterns from old books to any surface where a <unk> garden has to be made that leads to bad and <unk> design wrong in plan and <unk> for the life of plants 
 i read the <unk> of wayne <unk> 's exchange with a <unk> representative put the soviet economy on golden <unk> editorial page oct. N with great interest since the gold standard is one of my areas of research 
 mr. <unk> is incorrect when he states that the soviet union 's large gold reserves would give it great power to establish credibility 
 during the latter part of the 19th century russia was on a gold standard and had gold reserves representing more than N N of its outstanding currency but no one outside russia used rubles 
 the bank of england on the other hand had gold reserves that averaged about N N of its outstanding currency and bank of england notes were accepted throughout the world 
 the most likely reason for this <unk> is that the bank of england was a private bank with substantial earning assets and the <unk> rights of creditors to collect claims against the bank were well established in britain 
 by contrast in <unk> russia an <unk> government owned the bank and had the power to revoke payment whenever it chose much as it would in today 's soviet union 
 the success of the british gold standard was due to independent private banking and common law rather than the choice of gold for <unk> the currency 
 it is no <unk> that from N to N when the bank of england was an independent private bank the pound was never <unk> and payment of gold for pound notes was never suspended but with the subsequent <unk> of the bank of england the pound was <unk> with increasing frequency and its use as an international medium of exchange declined 
 the soviet union should keep these <unk> in mind as it seeks to establish the ruble as an international currency 
 one way to make the ruble into a major international currency would be to leave reserves of gold and earning assets in a swiss bank with distributions based on swiss laws 
 unless the laws determining the <unk> 's rights to payment are independent of the issuer of those notes however a <unk> ruble would be as unsuccessful for the soviets as it was for the <unk>

 securities and exchange commission chairman richard breeden told a congressional subcommittee that he would consider imposing circuit breakers to halt program trading at volatile times 
 mr. breeden in his first testimony to congress since taking the sec post said the agency is studying the friday the 13th market plunge including how current circuit breakers affected the market that day and the following monday 
 after the study the sec would be willing to consider adding new circuit breakers or <unk> the current ones he added 
 circuit breakers designed to give the markets a <unk> in cases of sharp price movements curb trading of futures or stocks at various trigger points 
 at certain points during the friday the 13th drop circuit breakers kicked in on the futures market slowing trading at times 
 a circuit breaker that would have closed down the new york stock exchange was n't <unk> 
 rep. edward markey d. mass. chairman of the house telecommunications and finance subcommittee is pushing the idea of a circuit breaker for computer-driven program trading in hopes that would curb turmoil in the marketplace 
 he argued that program-trading by roughly N big institutions is pushing around the markets and scaring individual investors 
 mr. breeden did n't reject the proposal 
 after the sec study of the drop is completed he said i 'm perfectly happy to work with this committee in identifying whether we need other devices such as a program-trading curb 
 mr. breeden backed most of the provisions in a <unk> bill that the sec brought to the subcommittee last year under <unk> david <unk> 
 the measure is expected to move through this congress 
 but the new chairman <unk> opposed a provision in the bill that would give the agency the right to close the markets at times of stress 
 mr. breeden contended that uncertainty over when the sec might act could worsen volatility in the markets 
 he argued that the current <unk> system allows investors to know precisely when and where any trading <unk> will occur and how long they will last 
 mr. breeden offered strong support for two other provisions in the bill 
 one would force brokerage houses to provide the sec detailed information about loans made by their holding companies 
 such loans often are used to finance leveraged buy-outs and the agency is worried that a sharp market drop could create capital problems for the firms 
 he also backed a rule to require large traders to report transactions on a <unk> basis 
 that information he argued is critical to <unk> sharp market moves such as the one nearly two weeks ago 
 in a rare package sale of its real estate k mart corp. <unk> mich. has sold N of its strip shopping centers to a limited partnership led by new york developer philip <unk> according to sources familiar with the transaction 
 they estimate the value of the transaction at close to $ N million 
 k mart officials and mr. <unk> would n't comment on the sale 
 k mart previously had announced it would report its third consecutive decline in quarterly earnings for the period ended yesterday the same day the real estate deal was completed 
 analysts are estimating third-quarter earnings will drop between N N and N N to about N to N cents per share compared with N cents per share in the year-ago quarter 
 it is unclear what effect the sale of the shopping centers will have on earnings 
 k mart developed the centers which range in size from about N square feet to just over N square feet 
 most are <unk> by a k mart store 
 the retailer reportedly will lease its stores back from the developer who plans to expand the small centers 
 the centers <unk> a total of about N million square feet of retail space 
 they are spread around the country and include locations in california florida washington and arizona 
 mr. <unk> who heads <unk> international holding corp. a new york-based real estate company owns more than a dozen other shopping centers in which k mart is a <unk> 
 the company is active in office and residential development in new york 
 however nationally mr. <unk> controls through limited partnerships about N shopping centers with about N million square feet 
 k mart runs N k mart stores primarily in leased facilities 
 the company typically sells the centers it develops but has usually sold only one or several at a time 
 motorola is fighting back against junk mail 
 so much of the stuff poured into its austin texas offices that its mail rooms there simply stopped delivering it 
 now thousands of <unk> <unk> and sales pitches go straight into the trash 
 we just do n't have the staff to deliver it nor do we have the space or the time says a spokesman for the <unk> ill. electronics company which has N employees in the austin area 
 it 's the <unk> problem and the weight problem we have 
 motorola is in good company 
 businesses across the country are getting fed up with junk mail and some are saying they just are n't going to take it anymore literally 
 while no one has tracked how many company mail rooms throw out junk mail direct-mail advertising firms say the number is growing 
 general motors earlier this year said it would n't deliver bulk mail or free magazines in its <unk> mich. office while air products & chemicals <unk> pa. says it screens junk mail and often throws out most of a given mass mailing 
 why the <unk> 
 anybody with a <unk> can answer that sheer overwhelming <unk> volume 
 according to the direct marketing association total direct mail to both businesses and consumers jumped N N to N billion pieces in N from five years earlier 
 though direct mail to businesses is n't broken out separately the association says it 's growing even faster 
 the <unk> has spurred <unk> companies to action with mail rooms throwing the stuff out rather than taking the time or money to deliver it 
 the direct-mail industry not surprisingly is <unk> at the <unk> of it all 
 after all this is the industry that has a hard enough time getting any respect that is the <unk> of so many jokes that television 's l.a. law <unk> <unk> david as short <unk> intensely <unk> and <unk> boring 
 the practice of businesses throwing out junk mail is a commonly known problem and it 's increasing as companies attempt to put through budget cuts across the board right down to the <unk> level says stephen <unk> a list consultant and chairman of the direct marketing association 's <unk> council 
 but it 's like <unk> the hand that feeds them because every one of these companies uses direct marketing 
 it 's almost impossible to track the number of companies <unk> junk mail since the decision is usually made in the mail room not the board room 
 and the practice often <unk> from location to location even within a company 
 but industry executives say businesses seem especially inclined to dump <unk> sent to titles rather than to individual names 
 motorola 's austin operation was one of the first to lose patience deciding a few years ago to junk any bulk mail that was n't addressed to an individual 
 magazines are n't delivered at all even if an individual 's name is listed employees who want their magazines have to pick them up from the mail room or the company library and are told to change the <unk> to their home addresses 
 at air products meanwhile the <unk> staff opens junk mail and often throws it away even if addressed to an individual 
 if they get N <unk> of something they open one see what it says throw N away and send two to people or departments they think are appropriate a spokesman says 
 direct marketers were especially alarmed when general motors one of the country 's largest companies and a big direct-mail user itself entered the <unk> battle 
 as of march N its <unk> office with about N employees stopped delivering bulk mail and <unk> magazines 
 employees were told that if they really wanted the publications they would have to have them sent home instead 
 the reason <unk> especially of <unk> magazines 
 direct-mail executives see gm 's stand as an <unk> sign even if the <unk> <unk> did bring it on themselves 
 why anyone would want to close themselves off from direct mail a <unk> does n't make any sense says michael bronner of bronner <unk> associates a boston <unk> firm 
 it <unk> of big <unk> 
 they 're going to decide what their employees can or can not read 
 the practice is however legal in most cases 
 jack ellis a u.s. postal inspector in new york says the postal service 's only job is to deliver the mail to the mail room once it gets there a company can do with it what it wishes 
 the <unk> <unk> ever optimistic are looking for ways around the problem 
 so far they say it has n't had any <unk> effect on response rates 
 and before it does they 're trying to cut back on the clutter that created the situation in the first place 
 among other things the industry is trying to come up with standardized business lists that cut down on <unk> 
 we 're going to have to mail a lot less and a lot <unk> says jack miller president of <unk> corp. a <unk> ill. <unk> mail-order company 
 but then again mailing less and <unk> wo n't be much help if the mail ends up in the garbage anyway

 senate democrats who favor cutting the capital-gains tax are n't ready to line up behind the leading senate proposal 
 their reluctance to support the proposal is another blow to the capital-gains cut which has had a roller-coaster existence since the beginning of the year when it was considered dead and then suddenly revived and was passed by the house 
 nevertheless oregon sen. bob packwood the ranking gop member on the <unk> senate finance committee last night introduced his plan as an amendment to a pending measure <unk> u.s. aid for poland and hungary 
 senate majority leader george mitchell d. maine was confident he had enough votes to block the maneuver on procedural grounds perhaps as soon as today 
 mr. packwood all but conceded defeat telling mr. mitchell i sense at this stage you may have the votes 
 the two lawmakers <unk> in a highly personal fashion violating usual senate <unk> 
 their tone was <unk> with mr. packwood saying he intended to offer the proposal again and again on future legislation and sen. mitchell saying he intended to use procedural means to block it again and again 
 although the proposal <unk> by mr. packwood and sen. william roth r. del. appears to have general backing by republicans their votes are n't sufficient to pass it 
 and democrats who are under increasing pressure from their leaders to reject the <unk> cut are finding reasons to say no at least for now 
 a major reason is that they believe the <unk> plan would lose <unk> of revenue over the long run 
 the <unk> proposal would reduce the tax depending on how long an asset was held 
 it also would create a new individual retirement account that would shield from taxation the appreciation on investments made for a wide variety of purposes including retirement medical expenses <unk> purchases and tuition 
 a number of us are not going to touch capital gains iras or anything else unless it <unk> to deficit-reduction said sen. charles <unk> d. va. who is one of the N to N democrats who the bush administration believes might favor giving <unk> treatment to capital gains 
 president bush has been hearing this kind of opposition first hand during meetings over the past two days with democratic senators at the white house 
 and at a <unk> meeting tuesday of democratic senators there was outspoken opposition to cutting the capital-gains tax this year according to participants 
 the trend is making advocates of the tax cut less optimistic about success 
 there is a <unk> shot of getting it this year said sen. david boren of oklahoma a leading democratic <unk> of cutting the capital-gains tax 
 he called the battle <unk> 
 other democrats who favor a capital-gains cut are even more pessimistic 
 there will be no capital-gains bill this year said sen. dale <unk> d. ark 
 i 'm probably not going to vote for any capital-gains proposal 
 the ira portion of the <unk> plan is irresponsible 
 another significant factor in the <unk> debate is the extent to which it has become a <unk> political battle between president bush and senate majority leader mitchell 
 mr. mitchell has made clear to his <unk> colleagues that the issue is important to him personally 
 today sen. mitchell and other leading democrats plan to turn up the heat again by holding a news conference to <unk> the proposal 
 estimates requested by sen. mitchell from the congressional joint taxation committee show that the <unk> N taxpayers got an average benefit from the capital-gains <unk> of $ N million each in N the last year for which figures are available 
 white house officials acknowledged yesterday that democrats still are reluctant to publicly express support for the <unk> capital gains proposal because they are loath to buck sen. mitchell 
 as a result the officials said they are open to making a variety of deals with senate democrats to win their support for a capital-gains tax cut 
 democrats asked in this week for discussions with president bush have suggested ways of <unk> with the <unk> proposal suggesting an interest in looking for a modified version they can back one official said 
 in addition white house aides think that there are numerous other important measures democrats badly wanted passed such as the <unk> back of a controversial catastrophic health-care plan for the elderly that might provide the president leverage in cutting deals with democrats 
 a capital-gains tax cut might be <unk> with such measures to help ensure passage 
 other possibilities include a child-care initiative and an increase in the minimum wage 
 if they ca n't secure immediate passage of a capital-gains plan administration officials also are n't ruling out making a deal with congress to put off a vote until a firm date in the future even next year 
 but the officials insist that such a deal on a future vote would have to apply to both the house and the senate

 president bush told reporters a few months ago that he was looking for the right test case to see whether he already has the line-item veto 
 vice president quayle and budget director darman said recently they 've joined the search 
 on tuesday the subject came up again when marlin fitzwater explained the constitutional argument based on the provisions above to the white house press corps 
 president bush does n't have any provision in mind but <unk> <unk> will be like <unk> at midnight in the coming continuing resolution 
 the harder question is whether anyone yet understands that mr. bush 's fight for his constitutional prerogatives is about politics as much as it is about law 
 we have been persuaded by the constitutional argument for the inherent line-item veto since N when lawyer stephen <unk> first made the case on this page 
 the N budget reform passed over president nixon 's veto took away the presidential <unk> power thereby introducing <unk> <unk> and <unk> the presidential veto 
 mr. <unk> discovered that the <unk> had worried that congress might take the president out of the <unk> 
 article i section N clause N says that whether it 's called an order resolution or vote or anything else presidents must have the chance to veto 
 <unk> an omnibus budget a bill ca n't <unk> the president of his power to veto items 
 finding a test case should n't be hard but there is something to be said for picking the best one possible 
 the white house had the perfect case but congress <unk> before it could go to court 
 after the hud and s&l stories broke some congressmen began to worry that their influence peddling at <unk> and independent agencies might some day get them in trouble 
 they worried about an interior department <unk> to <unk> all communications with members or their staffs 
 congress inserted the following into the interior <unk> none of the funds available under this title may be used to prepare reports on contacts between employees of the <unk> of the interior and members and committees of congress and their staff 
 the white house warned that this would be an unconstitutional <unk> of its power 
 when it threatened to use this provision as the test for a line-item veto congress <unk> 
 the fear congress has of any <unk> test led members to add the single most <unk> and ridiculous provision this year this section shall be effective only on oct. N N 
 this means interior contacts can not be <unk> only on one day a sunday that had already passed 
 if the white house is looking for another unconstitutional bill rep. john dingell is trying again to raise the fairness doctrine from the dead 
 president reagan vetoed this as a first amendment violation 
 the fairness doctrine 's enthusiasts are <unk> in the house who know the rules <unk> <unk> discussions on <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> 
 there are also other provisions requiring congressmen to join <unk> teams and new restrictions on <unk> 
 unconstitutional bills make good legal targets but the line-item veto is better understood as a political opportunity than as mere <unk> for lawyers 
 commenting on the budget mess this week president bush said the perception out there is that it 's the fault of congress 
 and you can look to the leadership and ask them why that is the perception of the american people 
 exactly right 
 now 's the time to make the political case that presidents need the line-item weapon to restore discipline to the budget 
 congress is in no position to <unk> mr. bush now that we 're into gramm-rudman 's <unk> 
 just this week the house-senate conference met N conferees divided into N different <unk> 
 senator daniel inouye agreed to close some bases in hawaii in exchange for such <unk> as $ N million for a parking lot at walter reed hospital 
 conference negotiator rep. bill <unk> pulled down $ N million in military bases for north carolina and <unk> allowed senator james <unk> $ N million for bases in tennessee 
 president bush should take the constitution in one hand and a budget <unk> in the other and get to work 
 he should <unk> out both unconstitutional provisions and budget pork 
 congress may have lost any sense of discipline but that does n't mean the country must learn to live forever with this mess 
 president bush has the power to change how washington works if only he will use it 
 troubled sci television inc. proposed to restructure much of its $ N billion in debt to buy time to sell assets and pay its obligations 
 the leveraged buy-out firm of kohlberg kravis roberts & co. which owns N N of the common equity of sci tv indicated in the debt plan that it would reduce its equity stake to N N giving the rest of its stake to bondholders in the restructuring 
 kkr also signaled to the company 's creditors that henry kravis and other kkr directors of sci tv would resign from the board once the restructuring is completed and <unk> their voting rights 
 holders of sci tv 's $ N million of high-yield junk bonds are being asked to <unk> a lot of debt in exchange for taking a N N equity stake in sci tv 
 they immediately termed the proposal inadequate and said the restructuring would not solve the company 's problems 
 i think the current plan is sufficiently flawed in a sufficient number of bondholders ' eyes that substantial revisions will be required to get it done says analyst craig davis of <unk> smith & co. here 
 investors interpreted the kkr move as a desire by the firm to wash its hands of sci tv 
 but a spokesman for kkr says that with only a N N equity stake it would n't be appropriate for kkr to keep board representation 
 kkr already has made about $ N billion of gains from earlier transactions with sci tv thus it is n't significantly affected by the company 's troubles 
 sci tv which is controlled by <unk> tenn. entrepreneur george gillett owns six tv stations including several cbs inc. affiliates 
 it is having trouble meeting its debt payments because of heavy borrowing in N for a leveraged buy-out 
 through investment banker drexel burnham lambert inc. sci tv is offering to exchange three classes of junk bonds for packages of new bonds and equity that investors value at ranges from N cents to N cents on the dollar 
 kkr would give up a N N equity stake to bondholders while mr. gillett would surrender an N N stake 
 while one big sci tv investor thinks that 's pretty generous many <unk> had been hoping that kkr and mr. gillett would invest new money in sci tv 
 those investors think sci tv needs new equity to survive 
 sci tv 's debt restructuring plan would defer payment of $ N million of bank debt 
 it also would defer interest and principal on junk bonds that have fallen due the grace period for paying the bill expires nov. N 
 at the same time investors estimate the restructuring would cut the company 's annual cash interest bill from about $ N million to $ N million 
 yet to pay that interest bill analysts say sci tv will only produce about $ N million to $ N million of cash flow a year

 kemper financial services inc. charging that program trading is <unk> the stock market cut off four big wall street firms from doing any of its <unk> business 
 the move is the biggest <unk> yet in the renewed outcry against program trading with kemper putting its money the millions of dollars in commissions it generates each year where its mouth is 
 the kemper corp. unit and other critics complain that program trading causes wild swings in stock prices such as on tuesday and on oct. N and N and has increased chances for market crashes 
 over the past nine months several firms including discount broker charles schwab & co. and sears roebuck & co. 's dean witter reynolds inc. unit have attacked program trading as a major market evil 
 several big securities firms backed off from program trading a few months after the N crash 
 but most of them led by morgan stanley & co. moved back in earlier this year 
 the most volatile form of program trading is index arbitrage the <unk> computer-guided buying and selling of stocks offset with opposite trades in stock-index futures and options 
 the object is to capture profits from fleeting price discrepancies between the futures and options and the stocks themselves 
 index arbitrage recently has accounted for about half of all program trading on the new york stock exchange 
 last month program trading accounted for N million shares a day or a record N N of the big board 's average daily volume 
 on tuesday afternoon kemper told bear stearns & co. general electric co. 's kidder peabody & co. unit morgan stanley and oppenheimer & co. that it will no longer do business with them because of their commitment to index arbitrage officials inside and outside these firms confirmed 
 kemper officials declined to identify the firms but acknowledged a <unk> dispute with four securities firms and said the list of brokers it wo n't do business with may be <unk> in the months ahead 
 we 've been opposed to index arbitrage for a long time said stephen b. <unk> chief investment officer at kemper which manages $ N billion including $ N billion of stocks 
 index arbitrage does n't work and it <unk> natural buyers of stock 
 while mr. <unk> explained he 's not totally convinced index arbitrage changes the overall level of the stock market he said that on an intraday basis it has major effects 
 we 've talked to proponents of index arbitrage and told them to cool it because they 're <unk> the market 
 they said too bad so we finally said we 're not going to do business with them 
 kemper also <unk> the big board for ignoring the interests of individual and institutional holders 
 the new york stock exchange has vested interests in its big member securities firms that cloud its <unk> mr. <unk> said 
 it has never been interested in what we think 
 the big board also has a terrible communication problem with individual investors he added 
 small investors <unk> that big operators dominate the market said thomas <unk> chairman of the national association of investors and head of the exchange 's individual investors advisory committee set up after the N crash 
 the impression i 've got is they 'd love to do away with it program trading but they the exchange ca n't do it he said 
 big board chairman john j. phelan said in a recent interview that he has no <unk> to eliminate program trading 
 he said the market 's volatility <unk> him but that all the exchange can do is slow down the process by using its circuit breakers and shock <unk> 
 mr. <unk> <unk> that the mere fact they put in circuit breakers is an admission of their problems 
 morgan stanley and kidder peabody the two biggest program trading firms <unk> defend their strategies 
 we continue to believe the position we 've taken is reasonable a morgan stanley official said 
 we would stop index arbitrage when the market is under stress and we have recently he said citing oct. N and earlier this week 
 michael carpenter president and chief executive officer at kidder peabody said in a recent interview we do n't think that index arbitrage has a negative impact on the market as a whole 
 according to lawrence <unk> a securities industry analyst at prudential-bache securities inc. kemper is the first firm to make a major statement with program trading 
 he added that having just one firm do this is n't going to mean a hill of <unk> 
 but if this <unk> others to consider the same thing then it may become much more important

 at a time when jon levy should be planning the biggest spring season in his dress company 's N years his work day is <unk> with intense moments of concern about one of his biggest customers campeau corp 
 the dress business has always been a gamble but it 's never been like this says mr. levy president of st. <unk> group ltd. which has become a hot name thanks to a campaign of <unk> tv commercials 
 every day mr. levy checks orders from campeau department store chains trying to guess if he will be paid 
 i 'm now monitoring every major account 
 campeau owner of such retailers as bloomingdale 's <unk> <unk> and jordan marsh <unk> financial collapse last month after an emergency $ N million loan from olympia & york developments ltd. a canadian developer and a major shareholder in campeau 
 the need for the loan surprised many analysts and bond holders who had been told at the company 's annual meeting in july that there were n't any major problems ahead 
 the risk of doing business with campeau 's federated and allied department store chains is about to increase greatly not only for mr. levy but for hundreds of other small apparel makers <unk> suppliers trucking firms and fabric houses 
 next week the country 's top designers and manufacturers will begin showing <unk> for spring N the second most important selling season of the year 
 and as the applause dies down in <unk> along seventh avenue and broadway <unk> <unk> campeau buyers will begin writing orders 
 orders from campeau retailers used to be cause for celebration 
 this is no longer true because of campeau 's massive debt load 
 it 's all anybody wants to talk about says richard posner executive vice president for credit exchange inc. a leading credit service 
 people wonder what 's going to happen next 
 many manufacturers are worried about being paid for merchandise already shipped to campeau stores 
 but those dollars at risk pale in comparison to the investment required to make and ship spring goods to campeau stores 
 the few million dollars i could lose today is nothing against what i could lose on the spring line says mr. levy who estimates that campeau stores will sell $ N million worth of his clothes this year 
 i 'm buying fabric right now for clothes which i may not be paid for until april or may 
 what happens to me if campeau <unk> between now and then 
 some credit concerns such as bernard <unk> credit consultants inc. have told clients not to ship anything to federated or allied stores on credit 
 this is especially true for spring merchandise says jim <unk> credit manager at bernard <unk> 
 campeau has too much debt 
 other credit houses such as credit exchange and solo credit service corp. are suggesting that their clients study each order before shipping 
 payments are good right now but we are n't recommending any long-term lines of credit says richard hastings a retail credit analyst referring to credit lines which make inventory purchases automatic 
 the campeau situation is a little uncertain and very difficult to analyze 
 because of those concerns some manufacturers say they will ask for letters of credit before shipping spring merchandise 
 we 're being paid today but we 're worried about tomorrow and will want letters of credit says the sales director at one major dress maker who asked not to be identified 
 howard <unk> president of the dress firm <unk> b inc. says it 's big time chaos today 
 i 'm going to ship and hope i get paid 
 if i need to ask for money up front later i will 
 carol <unk> vice president corporate communications at campeau says that all of the federated and allied chains are paying their bills in a timely manner 
 they continue to pay their bills and will do so says ms. <unk> 
 we 're confident we 'll be paying our bills for spring merchandise as well 
 typically manufacturers are paid N days after the month in which they ship 
 if goods are shipped to bloomingdale 's between oct. N and oct. N manufacturers expect to be paid by nov. N 
 but manufacturers now buying fabric for spring season goods wo n't be paid until march april or even may 
 some in the market question whether campeau will be in a position to pay bills at that time 
 everybody is worried about the possibility of <unk> says kurt <unk> publisher of <unk> 's retail marketing report 
 the buyers who work for the various campeau chains may lose their jobs 
 the stores they work for may be sold 
 what that will mean for manufacturers is anybody 's guess 
 campeau 's financial situation is complicated by an estimated $ N billion in debt due next spring 
 this includes a working capital facility for allied stores of $ N million that <unk> march N N and an $ N million bridge loan due april N N 
 the company has stated in recently filed financial documents that it anticipates refinancing its march N payments 
 in recent months numerous retailers have filed for chapter N bankruptcy protection including <unk> teller b. altman & co. and miller & <unk> inc 
 those filings plus the expected sale of a number of financially healthy chains such as saks fifth avenue marshall field 's and bloomingdale 's have added to the anxiety 
 right now federated owes us a considerable amount of money says morris <unk> president of david warren enterprises a major dress manufacturer 
 we expect they will be current with their debts by the end of the week but we are considering asking them for letters of credit before we take more orders 
 mr. <unk> adds that his company is now holding some goods in anticipation of being paid in full 
 it 's become a <unk> business he says 
 business has never been this tough before 
 not only does your product have to be excellent but you also have to be able to collect 
 other manufacturers are equally cautious 
 <unk> <unk> president of <unk> miller inc. says his company is now shipping only to the flagship stores of the federated and allied chains 
 this limits his financial exposure he says 
 the branches are just <unk> over empty halls says mr. <unk> 
 why should i be part of that problem 
 i 've got limited production and i ca n't give it to <unk> 
 campeau 's ms. <unk> disputes mr. <unk> 's comments 
 many of the branches are very lucrative she says 
 that 's just nonsense 
 as for mr. levy at st. <unk> he says he will maintain his credit lines with the various campeau stores unless they miss a payment 
 if they slip for N cents for N minutes i 'll stop he says 
 bethlehem steel corp. <unk> by higher costs and lower shipments to key automotive and <unk> customers posted a N N drop in third-quarter profit 
 separately two more of the nation 's top steelmakers armco inc. and national intergroup inc. reported lower operating earnings in their steel businesses marking what is generally believed to be the end of a two-year boom in the industry 
 wall street analysts expect the disappointing trend to continue into the fourth quarter and through at least the first two quarters of N when the industry will increasingly see the effect of price erosion in major product lines such as rolled sheet used for cars appliances and construction 
 it does n't <unk> well for coming quarters said john jacobson who follows the steel industry for <unk> consultants 
 in fact he thinks several steelmakers will report actual losses through the third quarter of N 
 bethlehem the nation 's second largest steelmaker earned $ N million or N cents a share 
 the figures include $ N million in costs related to a blast <unk> <unk> and $ N million in losses from unauthorized work <unk> at the company 's coal operations 
 in the year-ago period bethlehem earned $ N million or $ N a share including a $ N million gain from early retirement of debt 
 third-quarter sales dropped N N to $ N billion from $ N billion a year ago 
 in composite trading on the new york stock exchange bethlehem shares rose N cents to $ N 
 of all the major steelmakers bethlehem would seem to be the most vulnerable to a slowdown 
 it has n't diversified beyond steel nor has it linked up with a joint venture partner to share costs and risks 
 however in spite of the difficult industrywide environment of high cost and low volume bethlehem had pretty good earnings numbers said <unk> <unk> <unk> an analyst with salomon brothers inc 
 ms. <unk> had estimated third-quarter earnings of N cents a share but said the losses for the unusual items were larger than expected 
 still bethlehem 's core basic steel operations experienced a steep drop in operating profit to $ N million from $ N million a year ago when the industry enjoyed strong demand and pricing 
 the company said its shipments declined as a result of a reduction in inventories by service centers a lackluster automotive market and increasing competitive pressures in the construction market 
 at the same time production costs compared with a year ago were boosted by higher raw material and employment costs which resulted from the company 's new labor pact effective june N 
 we anticipate that steel market conditions will exhibit a further moderate decline in the fourth quarter as the automotive sector remains weak and customers continue to adjust inventories said bethlehem chairman walter f. williams 
 he noted however that the company 's order entry has increased from the low levels of the early summer following the end of labor negotiations 
 armco hampered by lower volume in its specialty steel business said third-quarter net income dropped N N to $ N million or N cents a share from $ N million or N cents a share in the year-ago quarter 
 sales dropped to $ N million from $ N million because the company no longer <unk> its eastern steel division which is now a joint venture with <unk> steel corp 
 along with reduced volume analysts said the nation 's fifth largest steelmaker was hurt by holding <unk> inventory when raw material costs of such key products as nickel dropped 
 operating profit dropped N N in its specialty flat-rolled steel segment 
 moreover the company said higher sales and shipments to service centers from its armco steel co. joint venture failed to offset weakness in the automotive market higher production costs and a poorer product mix 
 armco shares closed unchanged at $ N in composite trading on the new york stock exchange 
 national intergroup which owns N N of the nation 's sixth largest steelmaker national steel corp. posted net income for the fiscal second-quarter of $ N million or N cents a share compared with a net loss of $ N million 
 sales increased in the quarter ended sept. N to $ N million from $ N million a year ago 
 the latest period includes gains of $ N million from early retirement of debt and tax loss carry-forward 
 last year 's results were hurt by $ N million in restructuring charges 
 national intergroup stock closed at $ N unchanged in composite trading on the new york stock exchange 
 the company noted that its <unk> drug co. ben franklin stores inc. and <unk> corp. operations showed improvements as a result of restructuring moves 
 however its equity in the net income of national steel declined to $ N million from $ N million as a result of softer demand and lost orders following prolonged labor talks and a threatened strike 
 national intergroup is negotiating for the sale of its N N interest in national steel to concentrate more fully on drug distribution operations 
 international business machines corp. said it agreed to let motorola inc. participate in a semiconductor research project as part of its effort to bolster the u.s. semiconductor industry 
 ibm which made the announcement at the <unk> of a research center here said it invited many other companies to participate as well including some from europe 
 jack <unk> ibm 's president said ibm is also considering letting other companies participate in additional semiconductor work but declined to be more specific 
 ibm which said a year ago it was inviting companies to participate in some semiconductor work has become far more open about its technology as it has tried to rally u.s. industry to head off the japanese who now dominate the market for dynamic random access memory chips 
 while ibm armonk n.y. makes the bulk of the <unk> it uses it does n't make the equipment needed to produce those chips 
 and ibm worries that the japanese will take over that equipment market too unless u.s. semiconductor companies produce enough memory chips here to keep u.s. equipment makers healthy 
 failure of u.s. equipment makers ibm fears would leave it dependent on many of the japanese companies that compete with it in other parts of the market 
 ibm also said it expects to benefit from the expertise that motorola and other companies can bring to bear on the difficult problems involved in semiconductor manufacturing 
 ibm already <unk> in one industrywide effort to improve <unk> techniques 
 ibm said it expects industrywide efforts to become <unk> because semiconductor manufacturing has become so expensive 
 a <unk> plant cost $ N million in the mid-1970s but costs $ N million today because the technology is so complex 
 and ibm said it expects the costs to continue climbing 
 ibm which said motorola is paying just a nominal fee to cover the <unk> agreement acknowledged some companies had turned down its invitation to join in 
 but it said that was mainly because the project may not bear fruit until the mid-1990s 
 ibm said it thought more companies would become interested as the project <unk> 
 the project involving motorola concerns a technique called <unk> <unk> that figures to be crucial to future generations of memory chips 
 currently chips are produced by <unk> light through a <unk> to produce an image on the chip much as a camera produces an image on film 
 but details on chips must now be extraordinarily fine and the <unk> of even <unk> light are long enough so that the images they draw may be too <unk> much as someone using a wide <unk> could produce a broad line but would have trouble painting a thin one 
 <unk> by contrast travel <unk> and can be focused more tightly than light 
 <unk> have problems too 
 they can make the <unk> <unk> and can pass through material they 're not supposed to 
 but assuming those problems can be overcome they should allow for memory chips that could approach one billion <unk> of information N times as much as is contained in the <unk> chips that are just reaching the market and a million times what was possible in the mid-1970s

 in a stunning shift in direction provigo inc. said it will sell all its non-food operations to concentrate solely on its retail and wholesale grocery business 
 the non-food operations accounted for about N N of provigo 's N billion canadian dollars us$ N billion in sales in the latest fiscal year 
 in a related move pierre lortie chairman and chief executive resigned 
 mr. lortie joined provigo in N and <unk> the company 's drive to grow outside its traditional food business 
 he could n't be reached for comment

 at this stage it was felt i was perhaps more <unk> as chief executive 
 mr. nadeau also is chairman and chief executive of <unk> inc. provigo 's controlling shareholder 
 at a news conference mr. nadeau said the sale of the three non-food businesses which account for nearly half the company 's c$ N million in assets should be completed in a matter of months 
 the three units are a nationwide pharmaceutical and <unk> distributor a small <unk> chain and a combination catalog showroom and <unk> chain 
 investors and analysts <unk> the news 
 provigo was the most active industrial stock on the montreal exchange where it closed at c$ N us$ N up N canadian cents 
 i think it 's a pretty positive development said ross <unk> a financial analyst with <unk> <unk> <unk> inc. of the decision to concentrate on <unk> 
 mr. lortie 's departure while sudden was seen as inevitable in light of the shift in strategy 
 the non-food operations were largely mr. lortie 's creation and his strategy did n't work said steven holt a financial analyst with midland <unk> ltd 
 provigo 's profit record over the past two years <unk> the company 's and mr. lortie 's <unk> 
 for the six months ended aug. N provigo posted net income of c$ N million or eight canadian cents a share compared with c$ N million or N canadian cents a share a year earlier 
 sales were c$ N billion compared with c$ N billion 
 last month canadian bond rating service downgraded provigo 's commercial paper and debentures because of its lackluster performance 
 analysts are skeptical provigo will be able to sell the non-food businesses as a group for at least book value and are expecting write-downs 
 mr. nadeau said he could n't yet say if the sale prices would match book values 
 he said all three non-food operations are profitable 
 mr. nadeau said discussions are under way with potential purchasers of each of the units 
 he declined to confirm or deny reports that provigo executive <unk> roy is trying to put together a management buy-out of the <unk> showroom unit 
 mr. roy could n't be reached 
 <unk> <unk> was named senior executive vice president and chief operating officer of provigo a new position

 comments by federal reserve board chairman alan greenspan lent some support to the dollar but the u.s. unit ended yesterday lower against most major currencies 
 foreign-exchange dealers noted that the impact of the chairman 's remarks was slight and warned that the currency remains sensitive to developments on wall street 
 traders said that mr. greenspan whose statements are ordinarily cautious was especially careful to avoid any <unk> <unk> with fears about equities still <unk> financial markets 
 <unk> before a panel of the house banking committee mr. greenspan said the short-term value of the dollar on foreign-exchange markets is n't the primary policy focus of the central bank 
 our essential focus is on domestic policy mr. greenspan said referring to the goals of price stability and a stable economy 
 in perhaps his most telling remark mr. greenspan termed the current u.s. inflation rate of around N N as much too high to be ignored 
 he added however that inflation could be brought down close to zero without throwing the economy into a recession 
 analysts viewed the chairman 's comments as an indication that the central bank is <unk> to ease monetary policy further in the near future 
 the dollar climbed immediately higher on news of mr. greenspan 's testimony settling lower in later trade as dealers <unk> positions ahead of today 's preliminary report on third-quarter u.s. gross national product 
 in late new york trading yesterday the dollar was quoted at N marks down from N marks tuesday and at N yen up from N yen late tuesday 
 sterling was quoted at $ N up from $ N late tuesday 
 in tokyo thursday the u.s. currency opened for trading at N yen up from wednesday 's tokyo close of N yen 
 many traders forecast a <unk> of the market 's recent bearish trend and predict the u.s. currency will remain stuck in its relatively narrow ranges in the near term and then shift lower 
 but according to doug madison a corporate trader with bank of america in los angeles a large number of short positions must first be corrected spurring a temporary <unk> before the unit can turn lower 
 he predicts a downward move in <unk> trade and a less dramatic slip in <unk> noting that there continues to be a large pool of japanese investor interest in u.s. securities which could provide a solid base for the dollar at around N yen 
 market participants hope today 's gnp report will offer more substantial evidence on u.s. economic growth although analysts are quick to point out that the figures may <unk> the economy 's <unk> 
 the r word is looming again says one dealer referring to persistent concern among some market analysts that the u.s. economy is heading toward a major slowdown if not a recession 
 some dealers note that while the third-quarter figures may appear relatively bullish the market consensus calls for a N N annual growth rate unchanged from the second-quarter rate it would take a significantly stronger figure to alter market perceptions that the economy is softening 
 some analysts <unk> that the next quarter 's figures will present a more accurate picture of the u.s. economy showing a marked slowdown in a number of sectors including housing starts and equities

 <unk> <unk> associates inc. the closely held owner of <unk> <unk> & co. said its fiscal third-quarter earnings jumped to $ N million from $ N million a year earlier aided by a $ N million gain from the sale of stock in a japanese subsidiary 
 the apparel holding company had sales in the quarter ended aug. N of $ N billion up N N from $ N million a year ago 
 the company said its quarterly results are now being publicly filed as the result of the formation earlier this year of employee stock investment plans 
 wall street would like ual corp. 's board to change its mind about keeping the company independent 
 but what happens next in the continuing takeover drama may depend more on the company 's two most powerful and <unk> unions the pilots and machinists 
 some people familiar with the situation believe that the collapse of the previous $ N billion buy-out if anything may have strengthened the hands of these two labor groups 
 as a result both may now have <unk> veto power over any ual transaction 
 one reason banks likely to react to any new ual deal with even more caution than the first time around probably will insist on labor harmony before they agree to put up cash for any new bid or even a <unk> recapitalization plan 
 united pilots have shown on a number of occasions they are willing and able to strike said an executive at fuji bank one of ual 's large lenders 
 if you have both labor groups on strike you 've got no revenue and that 's a very scary thing for a bank to be looking at 
 just this past week a leading japanese bank asked for a meeting with the machinists ' union leaders to determine where the union would stand if another bid or recapitalization became possible 
 another reason <unk> by their success in helping to scuttle the previous transaction the machinists are likely to be more aggressive if a second buy-out attempt occurs 
 the two unions already had significant leverage simply because their employer has yet to settle with either on new contracts 
 that gives them both the threat of a strike and the ability to resist any wage concessions that may be necessary to make a transaction work 
 thus even investors who are pushing for the board to do a recapitalization that would pay shareholders a special dividend and possibly grant employees an ownership stake acknowledge that the unions are key 
 there 's less likelihood of creating and completing a transaction without the unions ' cooperation and wage concessions said richard nye of baker nye investments a new york takeover <unk> 
 mr. nye thinks the ual board should be ousted if it does n't move soon to increase shareholder value 
 both the pilots and machinists have made it clear that they intend to block any transaction they do n't like 
 the pilots will be involved in any transaction that takes place around here pilot union chairman frederick c. <unk> declared yesterday 
 but whether the pilots can team up with their longtime <unk> the machinists is another question 
 the pilots ' mr. <unk> says his union would like majority ownership for employees 
 at the very least the pilots want some form of control over the airline perhaps through <unk> voting rights 
 on the other hand the machinists have always opposed majority ownership in principle saying they do n't think employees should be owners 
 still in recent days machinists ' union leaders have shown some new flexibility 
 we may be able to reach a <unk> where we can accommodate the pilot union 's concerns and <unk> said brian m. freeman the machinists ' financial adviser 
 mr. freeman said machinists ' union advisers plan to meet this week to try to draw up a blueprint for some form of recapitalization that could include a special dividend for shareholders an employee stake and perhaps an equity investment by a friendly investor 
 if a compromise ca n't be reached the pilots maintain they can do a transaction without the support of the machinists 
 but at this point that may just be <unk> thinking 
 the machinists lobbied heavily against the original bid from ual pilots and management for the company 
 their opposition helped scare off some japanese banks 
 the pilots ' insistence on majority ownership also may make the idea of a recapitalization difficult to achieve 
 who wants to be a public shareholder investing in a company controlled by the pilots ' union asks <unk> <unk> an analyst at wertheim <unk> & co 
 who would the board be working for the public shareholders or the pilots she adds 
 ms. <unk> says she believes a recapitalization involving employee ownership would succeed only if the pilots <unk> on their demand for control 
 she also notes that even if the pilots accept a minority stake now they still could come back at a later time and try to take control 
 another possibility is for the pilots ' to team up with an outside investor who might try to force the <unk> of the board through the solicitation of <unk> 
 in that way the pilots may be able to force the board to approve a recapitalization that gives employees a majority stake or to consider the labor-management group 's latest proposal 
 the group did n't make a formal offer but instead told ual 's advisers before the <unk> board meeting that it was working on a bid valued at between $ N and $ N a share 
 but again they may need the help of the machinists 
 i think the dynamics of this situation are that something 's got to happen said one official familiar with the situation 
 the board and ual 's management he says ca n't go back to business as usual 
 the pilots wo n't let them 
 delta air lines earnings soared N N to a record in the fiscal first quarter <unk> the industry trend toward declining profits 
 the atlanta-based airline the third largest in the u.s. attributed the increase to higher passenger traffic new international routes and reduced service by rival eastern airlines which is in bankruptcy proceedings in the wake of a strike that began last spring

 during the quarter delta issued N million shares of common stock to <unk> and <unk> N million shares for use in a company employee stock ownership plan 
 the key to delta 's record earnings continued to be excellent passenger revenue growth said thomas <unk> chief financial officer 
 passenger traffic jumped N N in the quarter while profit per passenger grew N N 
 delta has benefited more than other carriers from the weakness of eastern airlines which shares the atlanta hub 
 although eastern is back to about N N of its <unk> schedule now the texas air corp. subsidiary was only beginning to get back on its feet during the quarter

 columbia savings & loan association reeling from <unk> changes mandated by congress and the recent collapse of the junk-bond market announced a loss for the third quarter of $ N million or $ N a share 
 for the quarter a year ago columbia reported earnings of $ N million or N cents a share 
 total assets increased to $ N billion in the latest quarter from $ N billion a year earlier 
 the loss stems from $ N million of write-downs on columbia 's $ N billion high-yield investment securities portfolio which includes about $ N billion of junk bonds $ N million of preferred stock and treasury securities 
 columbia owes its spectacular growth in recent years to its junk-bond portfolio the largest of any u.s. thrift 
 much of columbia 's junk-bond trading has been done through the high-yield department of its beverly hills neighbor drexel burnham lambert inc 
 for the nine months losses totaled $ N million or $ N a share compared with net income of $ N million or $ N a share a year earlier 
 the results include a $ N million write-down of the securities in the high-yield portfolio to the lower of their cost or market value 
 columbia also added $ N million to reserves for losses on the portfolio increasing general reserves to $ N million or about N N of the total portfolio as of sept. N 
 on june N loss reserves stood at $ N million 
 thrift officials said the $ N million reserve will be adjusted quarterly and will reflect the rate of <unk> and market conditions 
 the adjustments result from the recently passed <unk> bailout legislation which requires thrifts to <unk> all high-yield bond investments by N 
 previously columbia did n't have to adjust the book value of its junk-bond holdings to reflect declines in market prices because it held the bonds as long-term investments 
 because columbia now must sell the bonds within five years accounting rules require the thrift to value the bonds at the lower of cost or market prices 
 for its future strategy columbia officials said the thrift may branch out into commercial lending or managing outside investments as well as <unk> up more traditional thrift activities 
 the quarterly results also reflected $ N million in <unk> losses from commercial real-estate activities in california 
 thomas spiegel columbia 's chairman said in a statement that the thrift was disappointed by the effects of the accounting changes 
 but he said columbia remains one of the most strongly capitalized thrifts in the industry based on the economic value of its assets and tangible capital 
 columbia announced the results after the close of the stock market 
 its shares closed at $ N each in composite new york stock exchange trading down N cents 
 the price of columbia shares has been cut nearly in half since august when they traded at about $ N as investors apparently realized that the thrift would be forced to take a big write-down 
 the stock 's decline accelerated in the past two weeks from a price of $ N a share on oct. N 
 columbia officials said they do n't know how quickly they will <unk> of the thrift 's junk bonds because federal regulations such as those that would allow thrifts to continue holding the bonds in separately capitalized subsidiaries have n't yet been completed 
 columbia officials also said the thrift should n't face problems meeting regulatory capital requirements despite the large reserves and write-downs and <unk> regulatory requirements that should be in place by year 's end 
 its ratio of tangible equity to total assets as of sept. N was N N and total equity was $ N million 
 the thrift emphasized that it has a large portfolio of equity securities issued in connection with corporate restructurings and leveraged buy-outs which has a book value of $ N million 
 although many of the transactions related to those securities have n't been completed columbia said the ultimate gain on the sale of those assets will range from $ N million to $ N million 
 columbia also has <unk> gains in its public equity securities portfolio of more than $ N million

 <unk> cos. said it plans to aggressively discount its major beer brands setting the stage for a potentially <unk> price war as the maturing industry 's growth continues to slow 
 anheuser the world 's largest brewer and u.s. market leader has historically been reluctant to engage in <unk> as a means of boosting sales volume 
 with the passing of the <unk> days of swelling industry sales however the <unk> and brief <unk> into discounting are becoming standard competitive weapons in the beer industry 
 over the summer anheuser competitors offered more and deeper discounts than industry observers have seen for a long time 
 some experts now predict anheuser 's entry into the fray means near-term earnings trouble for all the industry players 
 the st. louis company said major rivals philip morris co. 's miller brewing unit and <unk> coors co. have been following a policy of <unk> and deep discounting for at least the past N months on their premium brands pricing their product as much as N cents a <unk> below anheuser 's <unk> label in many markets 
 anheuser said it 's discounting policy basically would involve matching such moves by rivals on a <unk> basis 
 <unk> announced its plan at the same time it reported third-quarter net income rose a <unk> N N to $ N million or N cents a share from $ N million or N cents 
 <unk> sales were $ N billion up from last year 's $ N billion 
 anheuser said its new strategy started in some markets last month and expected to be applied soon in selected markets nationwide will mean <unk> earnings for the last half of N and for N 
 the projection sent anheuser shares plunging $ N in new york stock exchange composite trading yesterday 
 the stock closed at $ N on heavy volume of about N million shares 
 shares of coors the company 's sole publicly traded major competitor fell $ N apiece to $ N in national over-the-counter trading apparently on investor concerns over potential fallout from the coming pricing struggle 
 anheuser noted that beer industry sales volume is N is following the trend that has characterized the last half of the '80s with sales volume being essentially flat while consolidation creates fewer bigger players 
 we can not permit a further slowing in our volume trend anheuser said adding it will take appropriate competitive pricing actions to support our long-term market share growth strategy for the premium brands 
 anheuser said it continues to hold to its <unk> goal of a N N u.s. market share by the mid-1990s 
 beneath the <unk> <unk> <unk> lies a powerful threat from the brewing giant which last year accounted for about N N of all u.s. beer sales and is expected to see that grow to N N in the current year 
 anheuser is the biggest guy in the bar and he just decided to join in the <unk> <unk> said joseph j. doyle an analyst with smith barney harris upham & co 
 it 's going to get bloody 
 jerry <unk> publisher of beer marketers <unk> a trade newsletter said anheuser 's announcement means everybody else in the industry is going to have a difficult time reaching their profit objectives 
 prudential-bache securities inc. analyst george e. thompson <unk> the importance of the announcement and called any comparison between the coming <unk> <unk> and the seemingly <unk> <unk> wars unwarranted 
 mr. thompson calls discounting a loser 's game for anyone without a dominant market share and projected that anheuser 's statement of intent could simply be a means of warning competitors to ease up on <unk> or face a costly and <unk> battle 
 mr. thompson noted that the disappointing earnings which fell five cents a share short of his own projections contributed to the sell-off by an <unk> and currently <unk> investing public 
 but smith barney 's mr. doyle who yesterday trimmed his N anheuser earnings projection to $ N a share from $ N called the market 's reaction justified 
 while the third-quarter earnings were a moderate disappointment he said the real bad news is the intensity of price competition in the <unk> sector 
 according to mr. <unk> the newsletter publisher anheuser 's market share is nearly twice that of its <unk> competitor miller brewing which had a N N stake last year 
 it 's followed by <unk> brewery co. which has agreed to sell its assets to coors 
 both coors and <unk> have recently been <unk> market share to miller and anheuser

 the <unk> house by a margin of N votes failed to override president bush 's veto of legislation renewing federal support of medicaid abortions for poor women who are victims of rape and incest 
 the N roll call illustrates the limits of power a <unk> abortion-rights movement still faces 
 it continues to gain strength in the chamber but remains far short of the two-thirds majority required to prevail over mr. bush 
 democrats voted to override by a N margin but republicans were equally firm in support of the president who has threatened to make abortion a decisive issue on at least three separate fiscal N spending bills 
 yesterday 's vote dealt with the largest of these bills an estimated $ N billion measure funding the departments of labor education and health and human services 
 to gain more leverage abortion-rights advocates may seek to <unk> the bill into an omnibus continuing resolution next month 
 but the stark numbers yesterday when N votes were needed indicate the president is in a commanding position for at least this year 
 unless he changes they lose said a democratic leadership aide 
 the action came as congress sent to the president last night a <unk> spending bill to keep the government operating through nov. N and provide $ N billion in emergency funds to assist in the recovery from hurricane hugo and the california earthquake 
 by a <unk> N margin the senate approved the measure after <unk> further provisions sought by the influential california delegation and despite reservations the house adopted the bill on a N roll call 
 the package is more than $ N billion above the recommendations of budget director richard darman this week 
 but given the political importance of california the administration was content to use its influence to prevent any senate amendments adding further new appropriations 
 the $ N billion measure comes on top of $ N billion appropriated after hugo struck the carolinas and caribbean last month and these totals do n't reflect the additional benefit of <unk> disaster loans 
 the bill last night includes $ N million to help finance this credit and further raises the obligation ceiling for the small business administration <unk> to $ N billion to accommodate the expected loan activity 
 in direct cash assistance $ N billion is provided in federal highway construction funds and $ N billion is divided between general emergency aid and a reserve to be available to the president to meet unanticipated costs from the two disasters 
 in the senate majority whip alan cranston used his position to win not only the expanded credit but also more generous treatment than the house had permitted in the distribution of highway funds in the next six months 
 the emergency assistance would n't be counted against a state 's normal allocation of annual highway funds and the bill <unk> existing restrictions that otherwise would prevent the use of federal aid to repair a toll road such as the san <unk> bay bridge damaged in last week 's earthquake 
 the underlying <unk> bill is the second required by congress this fall and since the current fiscal year began oct. N only the energy and interior departments are operating on permanent appropriations enacted into law 
 the <unk> over abortion is certain to contribute to further delays and apart from the health and education measure vetoed by mr. bush bills funding the district of columbia and the entire u.s. <unk> budget are in jeopardy because of related abortion or <unk> issues 
 the vote yesterday was the most <unk> in many years and though the democratic leadership is <unk> about how to address the abortion issue the debate is increasingly measured in party terms 
 the N democrats who supported the override yesterday compare with N who initially backed the <unk> exemption two weeks ago and N last year on a similar vote 
 by comparison republicans have held closer to the anti-abortion movement 
 only N gop members opposed the president 's veto a marginal increase over the vote two weeks ago and just N more than the N who supported the <unk> exemption last year

 new jersey gubernatorial candidate rep. james florio <unk> returned from <unk> to vote against the president yesterday in contrast with his opponent gop rep. james courter who has <unk> supported abortion restrictions in the past but was <unk>

 the new york stock exchange is expected to launch its own program trading vehicle today just as controversy over this trading strategy <unk> up 
 the big board this morning plans to begin trading its exchange stock portfolio basket product the first program-trading vehicle carrying the exchange 's seal of approval 
 <unk> will allow institutional investors to buy or sell all N stocks in standard & poor 's index in a single trade of a minimum of $ N million 
 <unk> baskets of fewer stocks will also be available 
 the securities and exchange commission gave provisional six-month approval to the big board basket at a meeting late yesterday 
 the sec at the same time approved a similar but smaller basket product on the chicago board options exchange where the minimum will be $ N million 
 also approved was a plan to trade stock portfolios by computer after regular hours on the midwest stock exchange 
 the basket products are an <unk> step in solving problems in trading big blocks of stock that came to light in the N market crash said sec commissioner joseph <unk> 
 new sec chairman richard breeden overseeing his first public meeting said there have been concerns that the big board 's basket could attract investors with a short-term perspective who would rapidly turn over the product thus increasing volatility 
 but richard <unk> the sec 's market regulation chief said he did n't believe this will <unk> dramatic new program-trading strategies that will be <unk> 
 the baskets on the big board and cboe which involve the actual s&p stocks unlike the stock-index contracts currently traded on the chicago futures markets and index options on the cboe will begin trading as critics step up their attacks on program trading and its contributions to the stock market 's wild price swings 
 the big board argues that its new product will help rather than hurt the situation by possibly drawing business from <unk> forms of program trading 
 <unk> are also an attempt by the big board to head off the exodus of program trading business to overseas markets such as london 
 big board officials also hope japanese investors will become interested in the exchange 's product 
 already many of the big board 's own floor traders are warning that the <unk> baskets are risky and not in the best interests of the investing public 
 the <unk> alliance of floor brokers said the new product with the $ N million minimum will benefit only big institutional investors and could lead to wild <unk> of volatility 
 stockbrokers who cater to individual investors said the big board 's new product confirms the exchange does n't want to curtail program trading which last month accounted for a record N N of the exchange 's average daily volume 
 the new york stock exchange is losing its cool here said james <unk> head of institutional trading at <unk> montgomery scott inc. in philadelphia 
 the new stock baskets are going to make it easier for program trading to be done 
 and it 's going to be done more frequently as the result of having more access to it at different places 
 both the big board 's exchange stock portfolio and the chicago exchange 's market basket are designed for institutional investors 
 the big board lists its targets as pension plans mutual fund managers and index-arbitrage traders 
 in index arbitrage program traders buy and sell stocks and stock-index futures to profit from small price discrepancies between the markets 
 at the same time only four securities firms have signed up with the big board to buy and sell <unk> as market makers an <unk> response 
 the market makers so far are cs first boston group 's first boston corp. unit morgan stanley & co. painewebber group inc. and salomon inc. 's salomon brothers inc. unit 
 kidder peabody & co. a general electric co. unit that has become the biggest program trader along with morgan stanley is n't a market maker although the big board hopes that will change 
 similarly the big board hopes to <unk> merrill lynch & co 
 neither has plans to be a market maker for now 
 traders said major securities firms are reluctant to become market makers because they fear the baskets may attract only limited trading 
 big board officials say only N contracts a day may trade at first equivalent to a day 's action at a small regional exchange 
 even though the big board says its product represents a post-crash reform some traders suggest that if the new basket had been trading during this month 's friday the 13th market plunge the dow jones industrial average might have dropped more than the N points it did 
 with the futures locked into a trading halt oct. N and trading in some individual stock difficult program traders would have undoubtedly fled to the basket system the traders say

 the loss in comprehensive care 's latest quarter is equal to N cents a share 
 in the year-earlier quarter comprehensive care earned $ N million or N cents a share 
 revenue in the latest quarter fell N N to $ N million from $ N million the company said reflecting poor utilization of the company 's facilities and its <unk> medicine contracts 
 comprehensive care shareholders have approved acquisition of the developer and operator of <unk> chemical <unk> and psychiatric programs for about $ N million in cash notes and stock of first hospital norfolk va

 after coming close to a partial settlement a year ago shareholders who filed civil suits against ivan f. boesky and the partnerships he once controlled again are approaching an accord people familiar with the case said 
 meanwhile within the next few weeks the limited partners in ivan f. boesky & co l.p. are expected to reach a partial settlement with drexel burnham lambert inc. regarding the distribution of the $ N million in partnership assets said one of the individuals 
 under the terms of the settlement the limited partners would drop their civil suits against drexel now pending in federal court in new york another individual said 
 attorneys involved in the talks said that the parties were closer to accord than they were a year ago when reports of an imminent agreement circulated 
 one individual said the shareholders ' accord was well worked out 
 however less optimistic attorneys warned that because of the <unk> of numerous defendants and plaintiffs with <unk> claims there is always the possibility that the talks will again fall apart 
 a shareholders ' accord would provide the first <unk> to thousands of individuals and institutions claiming losses as a result of insider trading by boesky & co. once the largest arbitrage fund in the u.s. 
 the plaintiffs are investors who bought and sold securities in which mr. boesky and his partnerships were dealing 
 some claim they suffered losses because they sold while he was buying and others because they bought while he was selling 
 stocks involved in the shareholder suits include union carbide rjr nabisco american natural resources <unk> cascade corp. general foods corp. houston natural gas and <unk> corp 
 there are at least N class-action shareholder suits that have been consolidated in federal court in new york under u.s. district judge milton <unk>

 individuals familiar with the negotiations said the partial settlement being negotiated would remove the boesky partnership the british fund and mr. boesky as defendants while drexel and other defendants would remain 
 charles <unk> of the washington <unk> law firm <unk> cutler & <unk> which represents mr. boesky in this matter said only that discussions are under way 
 there are no agreements yet 
 it has been three years since mr. boesky now in prison agreed to pay a $ N million fine to settle the government 's charges that he had traded illegally using insider information 
 out of this the government set up a $ N million fund for plaintiffs who can prove their financial losses 
 according to william <unk> an attorney at <unk> & <unk> the escrow agents for the fund as of sept. N the fund amounted to $ N million 
 separately attorneys for the N or so limited partners have had serious discussions that could lead to the distribution of the partnership 's assets 
 the limited partners include insurance companies financial institutions and individual investors 
 an agreement with drexel regarding the limited partners ' investments is an essential step toward getting their money back 
 this is because a delaware court earlier this year said that drexel is entitled to get its money back before or at the same time as the limited partners 
 drexel is owed $ N million by the partnership 
 an individual familiar with the negotiations said that whatever investments the limited partners do not recoup from the $ N million in partnership assets they will receive from the $ N million <unk> fund available as a result of drexel 's settlement with the government in december N

 jailed <unk> activist wins a battle against the 
 u.s. district judge robert p. patterson jr. ordered the fbi to immediately begin processing <unk> benjamin ferguson 's request for documents stemming from the agency 's investigation of him during the 1960s 
 the fbi had said it would not be able to begin processing the request until june 
 mr. ferguson who is N years old fled the u.s. in N after <unk> his appeals of a N conviction on conspiracy to murder 
 he turned himself in to authorities in new york earlier this year 
 he maintains that the information from the fbi will help him get his N conviction vacated and his <unk> indictment dismissed 
 his attorneys claim he was <unk> by the fbi and new york police as part of a campaign to destroy the black liberation movement of the 1960s 
 because the federal freedom of information act was n't law at that time the fbi was n't required to turn over information on its investigations when mr. ferguson appealed his conviction in the 1960s 
 but in federal court in manhattan judge patterson said the fbi records could show that mr. ferguson 's arrest was the result of questionable legal practices 
 the judge said that if the fbi 's proposed schedule was followed in <unk> the documents a delay of over one year will have occurred and plaintiff will have served approximately two-thirds of his N 1\/2-year minimum sentence by the time he receives the files 
 <unk> w. <unk> the assistant u.s. attorney handling the case for the fbi said no decision has been made about appealing the judge 's ruling 
 federal courts urged to cut costs and reduce delays of civil suits 
 the study conducted by a task force of the <unk> institution suggests that congress should require the courts to develop the plans 
 the study was initiated by senate judiciary committee chairman joseph <unk> d. del 
 the washington d.c. think tank recommends that the courts adopt different tracks for different types of civil cases in order to separate the handling of highly complex suits from simpler ones 
 complex cases such as antitrust suits and many business disputes would receive intense supervision by federal judges to keep pretrial proceedings moving 
 standard cases would require less judicial attention and <unk> cases could be resolved quickly 
 the study also said each federal court should set strict time limits for the pretrial exchange of documents and evidence ranging from as much as N days for cases in the fast track to as much as N months for complex disputes 
 and the study said federal courts should set firm trial dates early in the process 
 to take advantage of local expertise and custom the study said congress should require each of the N federal district courts to adopt its own plan to speed the handling of civil suits and to reduce the high costs in civil cases 
 although some of the study 's recommendations resemble those of similar projects the makeup of the task force was unusually diverse adding significance to the effort

 that level of production is n't of much concern as long as demand continues strong analysts said

 wheat futures prices fell however at least partly in reaction to the rumored selling of futures contracts equal to several million <unk> of wheat by commodity <unk> richard dennis 
 neither mr. dennis nor officials of his chicago trading company <unk> commodities could be reached for comment

 futures prices rose modestly but trading volume was n't very heavy 
 the december contract settled at N cents a pound up N cent but it rose as high as N cents 
 several cotton analysts said that the move appeared to be mostly technical 
 traders who had sold contracts earlier in hopes of buying them back at lower prices yesterday were buying contracts back at higher prices to limit their losses 
 floor traders also said that the market could have been helped by rumors which have been circulating for the past two days about china purchasing cotton 
 the rumor which has been neither confirmed nor denied has china buying N to N <unk> for near-term delivery 
 one floor trader said that if there were chinese purchases they should have had a bigger effect on the market 
 another said that if china was a buyer it would be the earliest that country had made purchases since the N crop year and thus would be a bullish sign 
 this trader characterized the recent price action as a contest between the <unk> who see higher prices ahead and the technicians who are basically buying cotton toward the bottom of the current trading range around N cents and selling it when the price <unk> more than N cents 
 this trader said that he thought the market would turn aggressively bullish from a technical standpoint if the december contract was able to exceed N cents

 cocoa 
 the modest sell-off which started on tuesday continued 
 the december contract ended at $ N a metric ton down $ N 
 the market is <unk> at least partly because of a lack of crop information out of <unk> and the ivory coast the two largest african producers 
 harry schwartz a soft commodity specialist for <unk> investors services in new york said the only report <unk> has issued about the <unk> of cocoa from the interior was for N metric tons as of oct. N 
 by this time last year he noted <unk> totaling N tons had been announced 
 a similar situation apparently exists in the ivory coast with no figures released yet this year compared with N tons as of this time a year ago 
 he said that if little cocoa actually has arrived at the ports shipping delays could result 
 this is the worry that probably brought <unk> to the market earlier in the week he said 
 there was also some fear that without ivory coast cocoa a large french cocoa merchant cie financiere <unk> <unk> <unk> might not be able to deliver cocoa against the contracts it had sold earlier for december delivery in london 
 however the french merchant has about N tons of old crop ivory coast cocoa <unk> in the netherlands from an agreement it had negotiated with the ivory coast last spring

 they fear that the boom may be too big for japan 's or anyone else 's good 
 it 's an explosive <unk> thrown at the world says kenneth <unk> senior economist at the tokyo unit of deutsche bank group 
 the ministry of international trade and industry is so concerned that it recently took the unusual step of urging japanese auto companies to exercise caution in capital spending 
 <unk> officials hope to avoid <unk> source of trade <unk> with the u.s. even though export restraints currently limit japanese car exports to the u.s. 
 not everyone is worried however 
 some economists and many japanese companies are <unk> by the warnings 
 the investment boom is mainly sparked they say by strong domestic demand and is n't likely to increase exports sharply 
 moreover much investment is n't aimed at increasing capacity 
 according to a survey of some N large companies by the japan development bank expanded capacity is the goal of just N N of the outlays for manufacturers alone the figure is N N 
 the manufacturers said N N of their spending is designed to improve products or add new ones N N is to cut costs N N is for research and development and the rest is for maintenance and other purposes 
 but the <unk> remain <unk> 
 with japan running enormous trade surpluses against much of the world they think that japan should meet the increased domestic demand by importing more 
 and eventually they contend domestic demand will weaken forcing companies to <unk> exports again 
 if there 's a further drive to export says <unk> <unk> an economist at the japan development bank that 'll be a problem 
 even in the short run the investment boom could <unk> a disturbing trend japanese exports are showing surprisingly little tendency to ease 
 japanese auto makers for example are increasing their production capacity in the u.s. the additional production should in part replace imported vehicles with locally manufactured ones 
 but although japanese companies increased their u.s. auto output by N N from january to september compared with the year-earlier period their exports to the u.s. will drop only N N this year nikko research center estimates 
 in contrast to previous economic <unk> japanese auto companies are n't just trying to boost production 
 many are pouring money into developing high-quality products to target affluent consumers and to some extent to avoid direct combat with cheaper cars from south korea and taiwan 
 others are replacing older facilities with flexible assembly lines on which different models can be turned out at once 
 so many companies are investing in high-tech machinery that <unk> ltd. a robot maker also had to build a new plant 
 the buildup is making japan clearly more efficient more <unk> advanced and more competitive declares a western diplomat in tokyo 
 but whatever its effects on exports and imports japan 's investment boom during the past two years has been <unk> at least partly by soaring domestic demand 
 japan 's marathon economy growing at N N this year is now in its <unk> month of expansion and some economists are betting that the boom will <unk> the record <unk> expansion in the late 1960s 
 japanese consumers are increasingly eager to spend their money especially on high-priced goods such as <unk> television sets and luxury cars 
 nissan motor co. 's domestic auto sales are up N N this year largely because its expensive <unk> <unk> and <unk> models are in heavy demand 
 one dealer told me that if he had more cars he 'd sell them right away says <unk> <unk> nissan executive vice president 
 he adds that the company is trying to keep up with demand by <unk> its employees 
 similarly honda motor co. 's sales are so brisk that workers <unk> they have n't had a saturday off in years despite the government 's encouragement of more leisure activity 
 with demand growing and workers in short supply many japanese manufacturers are spending heavily on <unk> 
 among them are the <unk> which had <unk> their shipyard work forces to cut costs during a prolonged slump in demand but now are <unk> an increased share of the strengthening global market 
 <unk> heavy industries co. a medium-sized <unk> expects its sales to increase N N this year largely because of rising demand for oil <unk> 
 once one japanese company steps up its investments the whole industry follows 
 because most businesses put market share above profitability to let a competitor 's addition to capacity go <unk> is to concede defeat 
 the emphasis on market share is evident at daikin industries ltd. japan 's biggest maker of industrial air <unk> 
 seeing new office buildings <unk> up and its sales soar daikin is building another plant which will lift its production capacity N N 
 the expansion is aimed not just at meeting demand but also at expanding the company 's market share to N N from N N currently 
 besides daikin 's major competitors hitachi ltd. and mitsubishi heavy industries ltd. are all adding production lines a daikin spokesman says 
 until now we were trying to increase productivity with the facilities we already had 
 but we ca n't produce enough anymore 
 the competition is even more <unk> in the auto industry where companies are racing one another in a world-wide market 
 nissan aims to expand its N N share of the market to N N by spending $ N million on a plant in southern japan that could make as many as N cars a year 
 meanwhile toyota motor corp. 's $ N million buildup is increasing its annual capacity by N cars and honda is spending $ N million on expansion 
 mazda motor corp. is still considering its options but it <unk> aims to double its annual domestic sales to N cars in the next four years 
 those who are n't worried about how japanese manufacturers ' investments will affect trade note that many new products are n't <unk> for imports 
 although imports account for less than N N of beer sales in japan <unk> <unk> ltd. which has been gaining share with its popular dry beer plans to fend off japanese competitors by pouring $ N billion into facilities to <unk> N N more beer 
 but <unk> development will make japanese companies stronger and big investments in domestic industries such as beer will make it even tougher for foreign competitors to crack the japanese market 
 moreover much of the investment boom is in high-tech fields in which japanese companies have only limited foreign competition so more investment practically <unk> more exports 
 toshiba corp. for example is spending $ N million on two new plants to build <unk> dynamic random access memories the next generation of computer chips 
 the product is n't widely used yet but toshiba which has already beaten everyone else in producing the <unk> <unk> <unk> believes that its early investment will <unk> its chances of beating its competitors again 
 it 's important to gain leadership a toshiba spokesman says 
 meanwhile toshiba 's japanese rivals hitachi fujitsu ltd. and nec corp. are n't sitting still 
 after doubling production in one plant nec is spending $ N million to build another plant that in two years will be able to make a million <unk> <unk> a year 
 the new chip plants wo n't be excessive investment says <unk> <unk> an nec vice president 
 we have enough products to make and the markets to sell these products 
 some of japan 's goods being produced as a result of the investment boom are already successful overseas 
 toyota 's $ N lexus automobile a luxury model that it started shipping to the u.s. only last month is <unk> up orders at a time when <unk> luxury-car sales are slow 
 toyota plans to raise lexus exports when a new plant starts up next year 
 what if its sales weaken someday 
 japanese companies have a <unk> competitor attitude 
 if excess capacity develops they say not everyone will suffer 
 the losers will be those with the least attractive products and many of them analysts think will be foreign companies

 <unk> 's results were somewhat worse than expected 
 jay stevens an analyst with dean witter reynolds said he expected the sunnyvale calif. company to earn N cents a share for the quarter and said the firm 's weaker profit was partly the result of increased competition from international business machines corp. <unk> 's principal competitor for mainframe sales

 the clearance by the food and drug administration comes after two years of restricted access for the youngest victims of aids to the only <unk> drug yet cleared to treat the fatal disease 
 the drug will be given treatment <unk> new drug status a label <unk> to drugs believed effective but lacking formal approval 
 the move will make the drug available free of charge for a time to children with the disease and symptoms of advanced infection 
 adults with aids have had access to azt since fda approved the drug 's usage for adults in march N 
 but despite more than two years of research showing azt can relieve <unk> and other symptoms in children the drug still lacks federal approval for use in the youngest patients 
 as a result many youngsters have been unable to obtain the drug and for the few exceptions insurance carriers wo n't cover its cost of $ N a year 
 so far aids has <unk> N children under age N with many times that number believed to carry the infection without symptoms 
 to date N of those children have died according to the federal centers for disease control

 i could get azt says mrs. <unk> who bears her infection without any symptoms 
 but my daughter could n't until she was too ill to take it 
 to watch your child die is an <unk> experience 
 her son healthy and <unk> currently takes no medication 
 the delay in getting azt to children has been blamed on a combination of factors 
 traditionally the medical establishment has waited two years to approve adult <unk> for pediatric uses because of a combination of conservative safety standards and red tape 
 <unk> critics have charged azt 's maker <unk> wellcome co. with corporate <unk> because children account for just N N of the patient population and hence a small part of the large and lucrative market 
 wellcome has replied that it is moving ahead to <unk> the relevant data and recently promised to develop a pediatric <unk> form easier for youngsters to take 
 still all this comes nearly a year and a half after philip <unk> of the national cancer institute offered evidence that azt could reverse the <unk> of aids <unk> sometimes prompting dramatic recovery of <unk> levels and <unk> of lost motor skills 
 since then roughly N pediatric patients have received the drug in his program 
 to some mothers the expected fda action is a <unk> reminder of what might have been 
 my first reaction is i do n't understand why it 's taken so long

 there 's no finger to be pointed she said 
 the crucial thing is that we learn our lesson well and to make sure other experimental drugs like bristol-myers co. 's <unk> do n't follow the same frustrating course as azt 
 aids <unk> which gradually <unk> children 's ability to speak walk and think is often the most striking aspect of the pediatric syndrome

 the bad news in the junk bond market yesterday was that tw services a group of restaurant chains became the latest prospective issuer to get a cold shoulder from bond buyers 
 the good news to fans of stable credit at least is what the rejection says about the state of mind of junk buyers 
 apparently they are learning to say no to excess risk 
 coniston partners which with related entities controls N N of tw had been planning to sell $ N billion of junk bonds among other things to finance their acquisition of the remaining public shares 
 but coniston a new york partnership managed by the firm of <unk> <unk> & oliver yesterday announced that in view of unsettled conditions in securities markets the offering would be postponed and restructured 
 what was n't mentioned is that coniston and its investment banker donaldson lufkin & jenrette just completed a <unk> road show for the purpose of marketing the bonds 
 and investors at least for now took a pass 
 tw 's junk bonds were n't as junk bonds go unusually weak 
 its fast-food restaurants including <unk> 's <unk> 's <unk> 's and el <unk> <unk> the only significant fast-food chain to specialize in <unk> chicken are stable <unk> and growing 
 but unless they continued to grow tw based in <unk> n.j. would have run into trouble 
 until recently such <unk> <unk> deals were routine 
 but people do n't buy anything on expectation anymore says jack <unk> who manages the high-yield fund of <unk> financial services 
 investors he adds are getting <unk> 
 the tw buy-out may yet be financed 
 there is nothing wrong with the company says coniston principal paul <unk> 
 the <unk> he says is that the junk market is n't as deep as before 
 tw 's <unk> meeting was postponed from tomorrow to nov. N 
 by then dlj hopes to be able to sell <unk> junk bonds 
 <unk> <unk> & oliver is likely to contribute more than the $ N million in equity it had planned on 
 banks may contribute more senior debt 
 and the total amount of junk financing will be reduced 
 a dlj banker putting a best possible face on it asserts that very few people said they did n't like the credit quality 
 people said they did n't think a billion-dollar deal would trade 
 but trading risk stems from credit risk 
 and by adding equity dlj would seem to be acknowledging that credit risk was a concern 
 indeed the dlj banker says in the <unk> capital structure cash coverage of interest will <unk> improve 
 as he sums it up we are listening to the market 
 what is it to borrow a term from coniston that so unsettled the market 
 some of the same risks that were cited and seemingly ignored in dozens of previous junk offerings 
 the tw prospectus says that if the acquisition had been completed earlier pretax earnings would have been insufficient to cover its fixed charges including interest on debt securities by approximately $ N million in the first six months of N 
 tw notes as many junk issuers do that adjusted to eliminate <unk> charges tw would have run a cash surplus in this case of $ N million over six months 
 but such calculations ignore the <unk> charge of depreciation taken to allow for the gradual wearing out of french <unk> deterioration of stores and the like 
 in fact dlj says the company <unk> capital expenses of about $ N million a year 
 tw 's pitch was that sales and earnings at its restaurants have risen steadily and that people wo n't stop eating during a downturn 
 but they wo n't necessarily eat at <unk> 's 
 the fast-food business is intensely competitive notes wertheim schroder analyst john <unk> 
 prospective bond buyers noted that tw historically has <unk> because it has been willing to spend aggressively on remodeling restaurants and <unk> <unk> 
 we were concerned that they were n't going to generate enough cash for capital spending and also to pay down debt says a big investor in high-yield debt

 one day last march cbs sports president neal pilson and olympics <unk> barry frank met for lunch at the <unk> club here 
 mr. frank told mr. pilson that olympics officials wanted $ N million or more for tv rights to the N winter games in norway 
 the cbs official said that price sounded fine 
 at that price cbs was the only player at the table when negotiations with the international olympic committee started in toronto aug. N 
 dick pound a committee member began by disclosing that abc and nbc had refused to even bid 
 then he asked mr. pilson to raise his offer anyway if we can have a number that starts with a three you can have a <unk> 
 mr. pilson and his team <unk> in a <unk> and took just N minutes to return with a $ N million offer 
 mr. pound responded it 's a deal 
 a <unk> mr. pilson announced his <unk> coup at a news conference that afternoon 
 mr. pilson 's rivals at abc and nbc <unk> at the price 
 how could cbs get pushed into <unk> itself 
 well cbs mired in the ratings <unk> and looking to sports as a way out wanted to close the deal immediately and block its rivals from getting another chance to bid 
 but mr. pilson has been put in the uncomfortable role of setting off a bidding frenzy for sports rights a frenzy that the networks had hoped to avoid 
 the price of <unk> has gone up <unk> charles m. <unk> the college football association 's executive director 
 with cbs inc. on a spending spree that may top $ N billion for four years of major sports events the new <unk> of <unk> could jolt the entire broadcast business 
 cbs itself could run up losses of a few hundred million dollars on four years of various sports if its big gamble goes wrong 
 abc a unit of capital cities\/abc inc. and general electric co. 's national broadcasting co. also risk losses if they <unk> cbs for other contracts 
 while rights fees head <unk> ad rates wo n't 
 advertisers already are <unk> at higher prices 
 the networks are paying too much for rights warns <unk> paul <unk> of young & rubicam 
 if they ask advertisers to absorb the costs they 're likely to lose all but a few who need sports above all 
 viewers may not be <unk> either 
 soaring rights fees will lead to an even greater clutter of commercials 
 at the same time some sports events will move off free television and onto cable or <unk> where half the nation 's tv homes ca n't see them 
 cbs has changed the rules by throwing out the old basis for sports bids that is can the network alone make a profit on it 
 mr. pilson <unk> the <unk> benefits of positive press <unk> affiliate stations enthusiastic advertisers and huge audiences that might stick around to watch other cbs programs when the game is over 
 the billion-dollar question is how much are those benefits worth 
 some tv people doubt they will <unk> and argue that even if they do they wo n't offset the multimillion-dollar deficits that cbs could run up 
 as we 've seen in the '80s says roger werner the president of the espn sports channel those deals can turn sour if the numbers do n't work 
 and three years later in a sea of red ink the heroes can find themselves with a lot of explaining to do 
 cbs <unk> top sports to <unk> the fact that they are n't supporting affiliates viewers and advertisers charges thomas h. <unk> who was ousted as chairman of cbs inc. after laurence a. tisch bought a N N stake in the company and took over three years ago 
 they lost the entertainment crown and they needed one 
 and they 've bought one 
 on just three big deals for four years of baseball and for the olympic winter games in both N and N pilson bid a total of $ N billion 
 that 's well over half a billion dollars more than abc and nbc were willing to pay 
 after N the winter and summer olympics will be held two years apart with the revised schedule beginning with the winter games in N and the summer games in N 
 now mr. pilson a former college basketball player who says a good negotiator needs a level of focus and intellectual attention similar to a good <unk> is facing the consequences of his own <unk> 
 next month talks will begin on two <unk> cbs contracts for the pro and college basketball <unk> 
 cbs is likely to spend whatever it takes to keep them 
 the potential bill more than $ N million for several seasons an N N jump 
 a few months later cbs 's college and pro football contracts come up for renewal they could go for close to $ N million more than cbs now pays a N N to N N rise 
 what happens to those two basketball contracts will shape the next five years of network sports says peter <unk> a former cbs sports president now at <unk> inc 
 j. william <unk> former president of espn says nbc may come in with a huge bid for college basketball to take it away from cbs and say we can <unk> too 
 and the winners will be the colleges not either network 
 nor by the way advertisers 
 mr. pilson is an unlikely big <unk> 
 in the mid-1980s after abc had just bid a record $ N million for the N winter games he <unk> at rivals for paying reckless prices 
 i love pilson but he was the guy who complained most bitterly and <unk> says robert <unk> a former cbs sports president 
 and yet his company is one reason why rights are so high today 
 rivals <unk> at the principle of pilson as nbc 's arthur watson once put it he 's always <unk> that rights are too high then he 's going crazy 
 but the <unk> mr. pilson is hardly a man to ignore the numbers 
 a yale law school graduate he began his career in corporate law and then put in years at metromedia inc. and the william morris talent agency 
 in N he joined cbs sports to head business affairs and five years later became its president 
 mr. pilson says that when he spoke out a few years ago i did n't say forever and i did n't say every property 
 the market changed he adds 
 and he is n't the only big <unk> nbc will pay a record $ N million for the N summer games and espn <unk> by capital cities\/abc will shell out $ N million for four years of baseball airing N regular-season games a year 
 our competitors say we <unk> them 
 who <unk> 
 maybe we recognize values the other guys do n't mr. pilson says 
 mr. pilson 's major events strategy <unk> after mr. tisch took over 
 mr. pilson recalls that in april N after cbs 's annual meeting in philadelphia he and mr. tisch took the <unk> train ride back to new york and mr. pilson used this extended private audience to <unk> his ambitions 
 mr. tisch a billionaire in hotels and finance was just learning the tv business 
 five months later mr. tisch took over as cbs 's chief executive and soon he was <unk> sole approval each time mr. pilson <unk> a <unk> large figure on a slip of paper <unk> it in an <unk> and gave it to sports negotiators 
 then in may N mr. tisch <unk> needed to make a bold statement to <unk> rumors that he might sell the network 
 mr. pilson gave him one he bid $ N million for rights to the N winter games in <unk> france abc and nbc would n't bid even $ N million 
 that started the <unk> bidding wars 
 the major events strategy mr. pilson says is designed to <unk> a place for cbs on the crowded tv dial of the 1990s 
 it 's also a fast fix for an ailing image 
 he sees flashy sports as the only way the <unk> network can cut through the clutter of cable and <unk> grab millions of new viewers and tell them about other shows <unk> a few weeks later 
 next october cbs for the first time wo n't have to start the season against the <unk> american and national baseball league <unk> and the world series 
 i 've been struggling against that for years says jonathan <unk> who runs <unk> the <unk> station in chicago 
 even if baseball <unk> losses at cbs and he does n't think it will i 'd rather see the games on our air than on nbc and abc he says 
 that is n't surprising 
 regular tv series ratings have slumped in the past five years and <unk> new shows is a <unk> shoot mr. pilson says 
 but top sports events are still a strong bet to lure audiences N N or N N larger than those cbs usually gets 
 mr. pilson says baseball and the olympics may help cbs move up to no. N in the household ratings race putting <unk> back into the network 's image 
 and the winter olympics will air during the february <unk> when ratings are used to set ad rates for local stations 
 that will please <unk> affiliates another aim of the pilson plan 
 they <unk> await the dream season in N 
 cbs will air the <unk> bowl baseball playoffs college and pro basketball <unk> and other premier sports events 
 it 's made me more committed to cbs says philip a. jones the president of meredith corp. 's broadcast group which has two cbs affiliates 
 the cbs plan to use big-time sports as a platform for other series carries no guarantee of success however 
 no amount of <unk> will bring viewers back if the shows are weak 
 in this market of N channels sophisticated viewers and the <unk> control trial is n't a guarantee of anything espn 's mr. werner says 
 if the show ai n't a killer they 're gone 
 during the N summer games for example abc touted call to glory but the military drama was missing in action within weeks 
 last october during the N summer games nbc <unk> pitched a new series <unk> 
 it <unk> anyway 
 moreover sports is hardly the best way to lure adult women 
 though cbs might move up to no. N in household ratings most advertisers buy based on ratings for women aged N to N 
 cbs may remain a distant no. N in that regard 
 nor is cbs a <unk> to get blockbuster ratings 
 in recent years the world series and the olympics were aired against cbs 's <unk> lineup 
 but cbs will put the athletes up against bill cosby <unk> and other shows in nbc 's no. N schedule 
 even the <unk> to affiliate relations may be limited 
 the sports lineup may add only N N to N N to a station 's annual profits 
 it alone is n't likely to stop a station from <unk> cbs shows 
 the world series seven nights was n't enough of an incentive says arnold <unk> of <unk> in rochester which dropped cbs for nbc six weeks ago 
 you 've got to judge where the network will be in three years 
 the <unk> benefits may prove extremely costly if cbs ca n't avoid big losses on the sports coverage itself 
 and avoiding such losses will take a <unk> effort 
 on the $ N billion baseball agreement alone cbs is likely to lose $ N million in four years contends mr. <unk> the former cbs man now at comsat inc 
 nevertheless he <unk> the deal plain smart for its huge promotional value 
 mr. pilson calls that loss estimate wildly inaccurate <unk> only that cbs will lose money on baseball in the first year 
 it 's too early to tell what happens after that he says 
 but mr. tisch expects losses in all four years of the contract he told u.s. senators last june 
 cbs will pay an average of $ N million more each year than abc and nbc had paid together and those two networks expect losses on baseball this season 
 yet cbs will air only N regular-season games N fewer than abc and nbc 
 that has <unk> some fans 
 it also indicates a $ N million drop in ad sales for regular-season games a risk cbs took to get an unprecedented lock on all <unk> games 
 if the playoffs end in four-game <unk> losses could soar 
 advertisers are <unk> higher prices which would help close the gap 
 cbs signed general motors and toyota to be the only <unk> sponsors in baseball for four years 
 price $ N million 
 but ad executives who negotiated the deal say that works out to only $ N for a <unk> ad in the world series through N N N less than what abc is charging for the series this month 
 moreover there 's no question ad rates will come down considerably from the <unk> price says arnold chase of bozell inc 
 other <unk> however say rates could rise later if ad spending <unk> 
 the winter games outlook also is mixed 
 cbs expects to make modest profits but rivals contend that it will take a beating 
 abc lost $ N million on the N winter games partly because of its $ N million rights fee 
 it aired N hours of mostly live events in calgary helping raise ratings slightly from N but still failed to deliver the audience promised to advertisers 
 cbs will add N N hours to that load in N and ratings could be hurt by a lack of live events 
 all prime-time fare will be on <unk> because of time differences with norway so the results can be announced on the N <unk> news 
 turner broadcasting will pay cbs $ N million to air N hours of cbs coverage plus N hours of additional events 
 barry frank the agent who took mr. pilson to lunch last march says that even if cbs loses say $ N million it matters little 
 ten million ai n't jack man when you got $ N billion sitting in the bank says mr. frank senior vice president at international management group citing cbs 's enormous cash reserves from selling off various businesses 
 it does n't mean anything it 's public-relations money 
 moreover sports has claimed its place as a guaranteed <unk> says david j. stern the commissioner of the national basketball association 
 this is n't <unk> bidding this is a situation of very careful businessmen making judgments about the worth of product and acting on it 
 i would tend to trust their judgment 
 that 's easy for him to say cbs 's four-year <unk> pact now at $ N million for four years could double in price by the time his talks with mr. pilson are completed later this month 
 that would cut into cbs 's slim margin for profit and error 
 cbs sports earned $ N million or so last year 
 and cbs takes in the least money in prime time abc and nbc charge N N to N N more for ads according to a variety survey 
 but cbs 's costs are huge and the risks go up with each new sports package that cbs <unk> up 
 although sports officials predict <unk> of N N to N N in the major contracts coming up for renewal ad rates may rise only N N 
 cbs hopes to save money by ordering fewer episodes of regular series because sports will fill up a few weeks of prime time 
 but the savings will be <unk> 
 each hour of olympics and baseball in prime time will cost cbs $ N million to $ N million an <unk> drama costs only $ N and it is aired twice 
 cbs may cushion losses with about $ N million a year in interest earned on the proceeds from selling cbs records and other businesses 
 but <unk> analyst richard j. macdonald of macdonald <unk> <unk> says wall street wo n't take <unk> to that 
 on a <unk> basis the network ought to make money he says 
 when mr. pilson is asked directly can you make money on all this he does n't exactly say yes 
 what you 're really asking is are the profit and loss margins anticipated on the events acceptable to management he says 
 then he answers his own question 
 yes they are 
 that 's the only question we need to address 
 place a phone order through most any catalog and chances are the clerk who answers wo n't be the only one on the line 
 bosses have big <unk> these days 
 or open up an electronics magazine and <unk> the ads for <unk> tape recorders and other <unk> <unk> 
 some would make even james bond green with envy 
 <unk> both corporate and private is on the rise thanks to the proliferation of <unk> technologies 
 and while sellers of the equipment and companies monitoring employees have few <unk> <unk> advocates and some lawmakers are alarmed 
 new technologies are changing the way we deal with each other and the way we work says <unk> goldman a staff attorney at the american civil <unk> union 
 our expectation of <unk> is being eroded 
 on the corporate side companies claim that monitoring employee phone conversations is both legal and necessary to gauge productivity and ensure good service 
 the practice is common at catalog insurance and phone companies banks and <unk> according to trade groups and worker organizations 
 it 's also widespread for reservations <unk> in the airline <unk> hotel and railroad industries 
 the communications workers of america which opposes such monitoring says supervisors listen in on an estimated N million calls each year 
 among companies saying they monitor employees are united airlines american airlines united parcel service nynex corp. spiegel inc. and the circulation department of this newspaper 
 some wall street firms monitor for <unk> purposes 
 dictaphone corp. says there 's a big business demand for its <unk> taping systems whether the sophisticated <unk> N system which costs from $ N to $ N and can record N conversations simultaneously or simple <unk> units selling for $ N 
 businesses want to <unk> information and ensure <unk> says john <unk> dictaphone 's manager of media relations 
 the state of alaska recently bought the <unk> system he says to monitor the exxon cleanup effort 
 merrill lynch & co. and shearson lehman hutton inc. say they use <unk> systems to record and <unk> orders between salesmen and traders 
 shearson says it has taped some of its institutional trading desks such as commodities and futures for about four years 
 both companies stress that employees know they are being recorded and that customer conversations are n't taped 
 kidder peabody & co. says it monitors <unk> conversations between brokers and customers to <unk> order <unk> 
 <unk> by individuals is harder to measure 
 but devices are there for the asking whether in stores or through the mail 
 the counter spy shop in washington d.c. for instance offers the secret connection <unk> case which can <unk> record conversations for nine hours at a stretch 
 that and other fancy <unk> may cost thousands but simple <unk> tape recorders sell for as little as $ N at electronics stores like radio shack 
 the most common use of <unk> devices is in <unk> cases say private investigators 
 while tape <unk> to <unk> say <unk> are n't <unk> in court they can mean leverage in a settlement 
 concerned with the increased availability of <unk> technology and heavier use of it lawmakers have proposed laws addressing the issue 
 nine states have introduced bills requiring that workers and customers be made aware of monitoring 
 and four states california florida michigan and pennsylvania have adopted rules that all parties involved must consent when phone calls are recorded 
 two bills in congress hope to make such restrictions national 
 in may rep. don edwards d. calif introduced congressional legislation that would require an <unk> <unk> during any employee monitoring warning people that they are being heard 
 the legislation is similar to a N <unk> bill that was defeated after heavy lobbying by the <unk> industry 
 also last spring rep. ron <unk> d. calif. introduced a bill requiring universal <unk> consent to any <unk> in cases that do n't involve law enforcement 
 in addition products such as <unk> tape recorders would have to include <unk> <unk> and labels explaining federal laws on <unk> 
 the outlook on both federal bills is uncertain especially <unk> the N defeat 
 the <unk> and worker organizations back tighter laws but employers and device manufacturers object 
 i 'm sympathetic with workers who feel under the gun says richard <unk> of the direct marketing association of america which is lobbying <unk> against the edwards <unk> bill 
 but the only way you can find out how your people are doing is by listening 
 the powerful group which represents many of the nation 's <unk> was instrumental in <unk> the N bill 
 spiegel also opposes the <unk> bill saying the noise it requires would interfere with customer orders causing <unk> and even errors 
 <unk> dale center manager at the catalog company 's customer order center in <unk> nev. <unk> monitoring 
 we like to follow up and make sure operators are <unk> our standards of company service says ms. dale who <unk> N operators 
 john <unk> a nynex spokesman says the telephone company needs to monitor operators to evaluate performance during the first six months on the job 
 sometimes he says we 'll pull someone off the phones for more training 
 federal <unk> statutes recognize the right of employers to monitor employees ' for evaluation purposes 
 and in the past congress has viewed monitoring as an issue best handled in union negotiations 
 but opponents led by the <unk> say new laws are needed because monitoring is heavily concentrated in service industries and N N of monitored workers are n't represented by unions 
 the <unk> claims that monitoring not only <unk> on employee privacy but increases stress 
 nine to five a <unk> office workers organization that supports the <unk> bill six months ago started a privacy hot line to receive reports of alleged monitoring abuses 
 meanwhile supporters of the <unk> <unk> consent bill say it is needed because of a giant <unk> in the <unk> consent law 
 currently if the person taping is a party to the conversation it 's all right to record without the knowledge of the other person on the line 
 <unk> other people 's private conversations is illegal and punishable by five years in prison and fines of $ N 
 the electronics industry is closely following the <unk> bill 
 some marketers of <unk> gear including communication control system ltd. which owns the counter spy shop and others like it already put warning labels in their <unk> <unk> customers of the <unk> law 
 but vendors contend that they ca n't control how their products are used 
 radio shack says it has a policy against selling products if a <unk> suspects they will be used illegally 
 everything sold at radio shack has a legal purpose says bernard <unk> president of the tandy corp. subsidiary 
 he says he has n't yet studied the <unk> bill but that requiring a <unk> tone on recorders would be <unk> 
 still radio shack is aware that some of its products are controversial 
 a few years ago the company voluntarily stopped selling the big <unk> a powerful <unk> 
 with its ability to pick up <unk> and <unk> wings it was meant to be a toy for children for <unk> watching says mr. <unk> 
 but we were getting too many complaints that people were using them to <unk> on their neighbors 
 the hottest <unk> in the computer industry <unk> sharply yesterday as digital equipment corp. announced its first line of mainframe computers targeting international business machines corp. 's largest market 
 ibm fired back with new mainframes of its own extending the <unk> N line with a N N to N N power boost 
 up to now the intense competition between ibm and digital has been confined largely to the broad <unk> of the computer market where digital sought to exploit ibm 's weaknesses in <unk> 
 but digital 's move into mainframes will target ibm 's home turf where it has a commanding N N share of the market 
 digital maynard mass. insisted yesterday that its marketing focus would differ sharply from ibm 's 
 this is not your father 's mainframe said <unk> <unk> a digital spokesman 
 it 's a whole new generation he said 
 ibm which gets about half its revenue and more than half its profit from mainframes also announced upgraded operating system software that together with the new hardware lets customers do so-called batch processing as much as N N faster 
 batch processing is the <unk> <unk> data processing that most mainframes typically <unk> through at night such as <unk> accounts at banks 
 ibm said the N new <unk> and <unk> models will generally be available immediately though three wo n't ship until the third quarter of next year 
 prices on the larger models which range as high as $ N million generally wo n't change 
 small models whose performance increased as much as N N will carry higher prices 
 <unk> to bigger models also will be <unk> 
 digital 's vax N mainframes which it claimed were among the fastest available were priced from $ N million to $ N million sharply lower than ibm models of comparable power 
 the first models will ship in the spring with the largest following in the fall 
 analysts were disappointed that digital 's new line apparently wo n't contribute much to earnings before the next fiscal year which begins in july 
 jay stevens of dean witter reynolds inc. said he may cut his earnings estimate for the current fiscal year because he had expected at least some mainframe profit this year 
 but he added that he expected to raise his estimate for fiscal N at the same time 
 after the announcement yesterday digital shares gained $ N to close at $ N in new york stock exchange composite trading 
 ibm shares closed at $ N down N cents in big board trading 
 analysts have predicted strong <unk> demand for the new line among digital 's customers 
 large digital buyers say the new vax will let them stay with digital when they need the power of a mainframe instead of turning to ibm 
 i 'm convinced there 's a huge market for this machine said stephen smith of painewebber inc 
 digital also plans to compete fiercely with ibm when the giant 's customers are <unk> new aspects of their businesses 
 digital however does n't expect to <unk> ibm mainframes that are already installed at big companies 
 in addition to commercial markets digital 's new line targets the low end of the engineering and scientific supercomputer market when it 's packaged with an <unk> <unk> known as a <unk> <unk> 
 digital 's push into mainframes comes at a time when its mainstay <unk> line is under growing pressure from smaller personal computers and workstations that operate on standard operating systems rather than on the <unk> systems that older minicomputers use 
 although digital has <unk> out a major presence in the booming workstation market profit margins in that market are much <unk> than for mainframes 
 the <unk> mainframe market also has shown new signs of life lately 
 ibm 's mainframe sales have held up better than expected this year with analysts estimating they have risen N N to N N 
 demand for these systems has been very very strong said bill <unk> a senior ibm marketing executive 
 we have a good strong backlog for the fourth quarter even without the systems that were announced yesterday 
 but the N line is nearly five years old which is getting up there in mainframe years and its growth is expected to slow in N 
 ibm armonk n.y. said it wanted to bring out the mainframes as soon as it could to spark as many sales as possible by the end of the year 
 the fourth quarter is always ibm 's biggest by far with most sales coming in december as customers seek to use budgets before year end 
 still steve cohen an analyst at <unk> financial group inc. said i do n't see that this will be sufficient to give ibm a significant kick in the fourth quarter 
 ibm has already indicated it will have problems in the quarter partly because of a delay in shipping a high-end disk drive and partly because the strong dollar will cut significantly the value of ibm 's overseas earnings when translated into dollars 
 some analysts have estimated ibm 's fourth-quarter per-share earnings will fall N N to $ N a share from $ N a share a year earlier 
 in addition to the new mainframe hardware and software ibm announced a <unk> system for data storage that it said <unk> half as much floor space as older systems but can store five times as much data on a single <unk> 
 that should help ibm address the damage that a <unk> storage technology corp. has <unk> in that market 
 concord camera corp. completed the acquisition of peter <unk> g.m.b h. a west german photographic products distributor

 this is in response to <unk> kageyama 's manager 's journal looking for the real thing in sony editorial page oct. N 
 though i agree with many of mr. kageyama 's comments i believe he points the gun in the wrong direction it is n't the americans who must be criticized for not understanding the japanese culture but the japanese who insist on forcing their culture on americans 
 the japanese want us to accept their culture but they refuse to accept the american culture 
 japanese managers ca n't expect americans to <unk> as if they were japanese instead they must manage americans as americans 
 americans are expected to conform to the japanese culture when in japan 
 what is wrong with expecting the japanese to conform to american <unk> when they <unk> here 
 americans place native or native <unk> in charge of subsidiaries overseas 
 european <unk> do likewise even in america their affiliates are usually run by american managers

 would he suggest that employees of an american company doing business in japan conform to their new bosses ' culture and philosophy 
 obviously not 
 thus the conclusion is that the burden <unk> with management to <unk> the culture and philosophy of the country in which they are operating 
 the workers can be motivated and the company reach its full potential only when management <unk> the employees ' perspective 
 a. <unk> <unk> president municipal code corp <unk> fla 
 i believe mr. kageyama left out one major aspect of japanese culture that <unk> his piece the belief in the <unk> of japanese culture and behavior vs. others 
 a manager should not have to <unk> the opinions of his employees about the style of his management 
 instead he should listen to see how that criticism can be used <unk> to advance his objective of carrying out a set of tasks through the efforts of his subordinates 
 japanese culture vs. american culture is irrelevant 
 the key is how a manager from one culture can <unk> employees from another 
 for mr. kageyama to argue that american employees must <unk> accept a direct <unk> of the japanese way of doing things is outright cultural <unk> of the first order 
 the japanese are <unk> the opportunity to <unk> a new corporate culture based on a fusion of the best aspects of both national <unk> 
 mr. kageyama is accurate to deny a specific <unk> bias 
 it is more difficult to deny a general <unk> in seeing things only the japanese way

 many americans still <unk> over their own personal feelings about abortion 
 mr. bush 's problem is n't so much that he seems to be <unk> over the issue as it is that he seems to <unk> on it 
 the political risk would be far less if the president drew a firm line and <unk> to it experts insist 
 if you have a position you 're better off to stick with it than to move around very much says republican strategist john sears 
 the need for <unk> is especially <unk> for mr. bush who mr. sears maintains lacks a strong ideological base 
 by his moderate republican heritage as well as the warnings of political advisers who say the issue is vital to younger voters the president might seem to have at least some <unk> with abortion-rights arguments 
 yet he is also firmly bound by his hard-line rhetoric and promises he made to anti-abortion activists during his long pursuit of the white house 
 on many issues <unk> for instance his keen political <unk> overcome such conflicts 
 but mr. bush and his advisers <unk> the politics of the abortion issue failing to grasp how dramatically the abortion-rights movement would be aroused following last summer 's supreme court decision to restrict those rights in the webster case 
 it was one of the <unk> changes in public attitudes i 've ever seen says former reagan <unk> richard <unk> 
 these days when others raise the subject of abortion the usually <unk> president can be <unk> almost to the point of <unk> 
 ten days ago he was asked to <unk> the reasons behind his anti-abortion stance 
 my position is well-known and <unk> he replied 
 a close look at his record over the last N years suggests that mr. bush has <unk> his views on all sides of the issue 
 in N as the u.s. representative to the united nations he wrote an introduction to a book on world population in which he <unk> of his leadership during his term in congress in expanding <unk> services for the poor 
 running for president in early N he was also quoted as supporting federal funding for abortions in cases of rape incest and to save the life of the mother 
 in his rolling stone interview in N mr. bush <unk> his abortion-rights remarks to contrast himself with his rival ronald reagan 
 in addition to supporting the landmark roe vs. wade supreme court decision <unk> abortion mr. bush said he opposed the constitutional ban on abortion that mr. reagan was promising to promote 
 as mr. reagan 's running <unk> though mr. bush plunged <unk> into the anti-abortion position <unk> a constitutional amendment <unk> abortion 
 he acknowledged only one difference with mr. reagan that the amendment ought to have exceptions for rape and incest as well as to save a woman 's life 
 throughout the early 1980s mr. bush was quoted sometimes supporting federal funding for abortion in cases of rape and incest and sometimes opposing it 
 in april N <unk> president bush had his staff write a letter <unk> out that he would support a constitutional amendment banning abortions except in cases of rape incest and life <unk> but that he opposed federal funding in all but the latter case 
 at the gop convention last year he again came out for an amendment with exceptions for rape incest and life <unk> 
 his rhetoric gathered momentum as he rolled into office <unk> his firm support of our cause during an anti-abortion rally three days after his <unk> last january 
 he again urged passage of a constitutional amendment <unk> abortion 
 but when the high court ruled in the webster case in july the president began to lower the volume 
 when the ruling was handed down the <unk> president dispatched chief of staff john <unk> to issue a statement and refused to answer questions himself 
 he did later threaten <unk> over legislation restoring the district of columbia 's right to use its own tax money to fund abortions for poor women and over restoring funding to the united nations population fund 
 but in the months since then while trying to drum up support for other issues such as an <unk> constitutional amendment he has <unk> away from talking about abortion 
 what few comments he has initiated have been <unk> such as urging greater efforts toward the protection of human life at a meeting of catholic lawyers in boston last month 
 the white house has likewise avoided any involvement in florida 's recent special legislative session on abortion which anti-abortion forces had regarded as a key test of their ability to get state lawmakers to <unk> abortion restrictions 
 the session failed to enact any new curbs 
 now some see mr. bush trapped in a position he is neither comfortable with nor able to escape 
 ken <unk> head of the republican mainstream committee a group of party <unk> observes the administration finds itself in an ideological <unk> de <unk> that it will find it difficult if not impossible to get itself out of 
 christopher cox 's oct. N editorial-page article toward more <unk> lawsuits misses the point 
 the N americans with disabilities act is about eliminating <unk> barriers 
 when we look closely at our own history it is clear that our <unk> mandated civil rights have <unk> not through the <unk> of people 's hearts but through legislation and constitutional amendments 
 this is how american women won the right to vote 
 and it is how <unk> and other minority groups were guaranteed their equal rights as citizens in this nation 
 for the more than N million americans with disabilities the N americans with disabilities act provides the missing piece 
 disabled americans have had their civil rights guaranteed in all federally funded programs since section N was passed as a part of the N rehabilitation act 
 the N act simply <unk> these guarantees to the private sector 
 those who fear a <unk> of suits <unk> our legal system need only look at the record on the rehabilitation act 
 without legal <unk> there are no guarantees of civil rights for anyone

 goodyear tire & rubber co. buoyed by improved operating profit in its tire segment reported that third-quarter net income rose N N to $ N million or $ N a share 
 in the year-ago period goodyear had net of $ N million or $ N a share 
 sales rose slightly to $ N billion from $ N billion 
 analysts had mixed responses to the results 
 donald <unk> an independent analyst in new <unk> conn. said he was impressed with the company 's performance 
 he said results were better than he 'd expected and indicate that goodyear is in the midst of a turnaround from a string of lackluster quarters that have plagued the company for a year 
 however harry <unk> an analyst at mcdonald & co. cleveland said goodyear 's results fell at the bottom of his range of estimates 
 excluding an increase in the tax rate and the effects of foreign currency <unk> mr. <unk> said the company 's results were still a little disappointing 
 goodyear 's stock which has been weak in recent weeks fell $ N yesterday to close at $ N a share in composite trading on the new york stock exchange 
 the <unk> <unk> company said pretax operating income in its tire segment jumped about N N to $ N million from $ N million a year earlier reflecting improvements in raw material costs sales of replacement tires and pricing 
 mcdonald 's mr. <unk> said goodyear appeared to have held or gained some market share in the u.s. for the first time since the second quarter of N 
 but goodyear said total u.s. tire unit sales were off about N N 
 total tire segment sales were up only about N N to $ N billion and the company said it reduced manufacturing levels at some of its u.s. tire plants because of inventory adjustments and <unk> production by auto makers 
 in the latest quarter goodyear 's tax rate was N N compared with N N a year earlier 
 as a result total tax outlays were $ N million compared with $ N million the year earlier 
 for the nine months profit skidded about N N reflecting charges taken in this year 's second quarter and the effect of <unk> of weaker foreign currencies into the stronger u.s. dollar 
 net was $ N million or $ N a share compared with net of $ N million or $ N a share the year earlier 
 the latest nine months included charges of $ N million related to the company 's south african subsidiary and unused pipe sold by its crude oil pipeline unit 
 sales rose nearly N N to $ N billion from $ N billion 
 environmental control group inc. said it expects to report minimal earnings or a loss for the third quarter 
 the environmental services company said that the <unk> of unsuccessful product lines and an increase in <unk> reserves probably will result in charges of $ N million to $ N million most of which will be taken against third-quarter results 
 in the year-ago quarter the company reported earnings of $ N million or N cents a share 
 former usx corp. chairman david m. roderick may have been lucky he retired last may 
 as he handed over the reins to successor charles a. corry steel profits were close to a cyclical peak 
 though imports were troublesome they were n't running away with the market and american companies had high hopes that steel import quotas would be extended for another five years 
 perhaps most important carl icahn who had once threatened a hostile takeover bid was subdued 
 he and mr. roderick were even <unk> out together 
 today mr. corry <unk> over a company whose fortunes have changed abruptly 
 mr. icahn the company 's <unk> <unk> adversary recently disclosed that he had raised his usx stake to N N and he again threatened a takeover 
 a battle with mr. icahn would <unk> even the most <unk> chief executive to say nothing of one who took the helm less than five months ago 
 in addition usx 's giant steel segment representing N N of its N sales is facing softening demand and slipping prices as well as increasing competition from foreign steelmakers and low-cost minimills 
 the import quotas got only a N 1\/2-year extension and usx is <unk> under a staggering $ N billion debt at a time when it must spend money to upgrade steel mills and drill for oil 
 it 's a <unk> of fire for corry says one usx executive 
 the burning question is whether the new chief can <unk> mr. icahn without being pushed into unwelcome moves 
 mr. corry might have to <unk> the company more than he wants to 
 or he might have to incur a huge expense of either buying mr. icahn 's stock possibly at a premium or paying stockholders a special dividend partly because of mr. icahn 's pressure 
 with his recent purchases of usx common stock mr. icahn shattered a <unk> <unk> standstill agreement with mr. roderick 
 in N mr. roderick <unk> <unk> mr. icahn 's first bullet after the takeover specialist had built up an N N stake 
 mr. roderick did so by having usx redeem a series of guaranteed notes a move that in effect raised the cost of a $ N billion icahn bid by about $ N billion 
 and he managed to fend off further advances and even strike up an unlikely friendship with the <unk> 
 over <unk> at new york 's sky club and links club restaurants the steel executive and the big investor talked steel international trade and thoroughbred horses 
 mr. corry who has <unk> up on corporate raiders by reading t. boone pickens 's <unk> had hoped the <unk> would continue 
 he was shocked associates say to learn of mr. icahn 's new takeover threat 
 both men declined to be interviewed for this article 
 but the fiercely competitive mr. corry quickly showed he 's no <unk> 
 he <unk> with directors at a special meeting two weeks ago and tried to block his opponent 
 although the board believed that mr. icahn is more interested in talking the stock price higher than acquiring usx it adopted a <unk> defense to be <unk> if anyone <unk> a N N stake 
 now it 's mr. icahn 's move 
 will he try to gain a seat on or control of the board and force a radical split of usx into separate oil and steel companies 
 given the weakness of the junk-bond market can he finance a buy-out 
 mr. icahn may not want to sell out unless he can get a special dividend similar to one he received before selling his stake in texaco inc. in june a coup that gave him enough cash to make his usx move 
 and although the recent turmoil in the stock and junk-bond markets by making it harder to arrange takeover financing has eased some of the pressure on mr. corry it does n't end the takeover threat 
 i know it 's not over a <unk> mr. corry acknowledged while <unk> steel suppliers in new york on oct. N and inviting them to a buffet of <unk> and <unk> in honor of kobe steel ltd. usx 's partner in a steel mill in <unk> ohio 
 in fact it 's barely begun for mr. corry who faces tough decisions before he has had a chance to get settled into his new job 
 he 's in a vulnerable position because he has n't established much credibility on his own says <unk> <unk> a securities analyst at painewebber inc 
 the <unk> tax attorney never even <unk> to the job of chief executive 
 an <unk> college student who <unk> in <unk> until he concluded that he could n't stand cutting up <unk> mr. corry wanted to work for a big company that could do big things 
 but after joining the tax department of a usx subsidiary N years ago he set the modest goal of becoming tax manager by the age of N 
 for years he quietly stuck to the back accounting rooms wearing a hat to work because everyone else did 
 i was never a rebel he said in an earlier interview 
 i do n't think most of the people that have been around me would ever say they 've seen me pound the table or get angry 
 yet the <unk> mr. corry helped chart usx 's transition from big steel to big oil 
 he served as mr. roderick 's front man in <unk> negotiations for the N purchase of marathon oil for $ N billion 
 nevertheless mr. corry once named chief executive did n't waste any time <unk> himself from his former boss who still has an office on the <unk> floor of the usx tower in pittsburgh 
 soon after taking over last june mr. corry <unk> a pay cut imposed on <unk> workers a move that mr. roderick had n't made in spite of improved earnings 
 mr. corry also ruled that all board meetings would be held in pittsburgh instead of new york or <unk> ohio marathon 's home 
 and earlier this month he announced the sale of the reserves of texas oil & gas which was acquired three years ago and has n't posted any significant operating profits since 
 one former executive says nobody wanted that deal inside usx except dave roderick who was a hunting and fishing buddy of william l. <unk> chairman of texas oil & gas 
 the executive recalls mr. corry <unk> to him and others remember this was dave 's deal 
 what <unk> many usx executives and shareholders was that the acquisition for $ N billion of stock doubled the usx shares outstanding and considerably diluted them 
 what 's more the takeover occurred as natural-gas prices were falling and just as texas oil & gas reported its first annual loss in N years 
 mr. corry expected the texas oil & gas sale to <unk> mr. icahn by addressing his concern about boosting shareholder value 
 but when the two men met in new york a day after mr. icahn disclosed the rise in his usx stake mr. corry learned that mr. icahn wanted him to sell all of texas oil not just its reserves of about N trillion cubic feet of natural gas and N million barrels of oil but also its pipeline <unk> and <unk> operations 
 that would leave usx with marathon its steel mills and its diversified business segment which includes among other things mineral and transportation products 
 some speculate that mr. corry would agree if he could find a buyer at the right price 
 the problem is that mr. icahn is pushing him to move faster and further in restructuring usx than mr. corry had planned 
 mr. icahn has long believed associates say that the company whose N sales totaled $ N billion is worth $ N a share if broken up 
 the stock closed yesterday at $ N giving mr. icahn 's N million shares a value of $ N billion 
 mr. icahn advocates the sale of the company 's steel operations and mr. corry does n't necessarily disagree 
 unlike his predecessor who saw steel as america 's <unk> mr. corry tends to view it as a <unk> and <unk> business with limited potential associates say 
 in the past five years usx has turned steel into a profit maker by closing several plants and reducing labor costs 
 but the short-term outlook is <unk> 
 it is n't surprising that messrs. roderick and corry view steel so differently 
 while mr. roderick was <unk> in the <unk> of pittsburgh 's smoking mills mr. corry grew up in cincinnati a city <unk> <unk> and more accustomed to pork <unk> than <unk> iron 
 he has never met lynn williams the president of the united steelworkers union and is n't active in the industry 's main trade group the american iron and steel institute which mr. roderick served as chairman 
 dave thought the country needed a strong u.s. steel and while chuck agreed he was more apt to say not at any cost to shareholders a former executive says 
 indeed mr. corry at an august press conference talked about investing in steel as long as it provides a good return and not a day longer 
 however shedding steel would run directly counter to mr. roderick 's original rationale for diversifying into oil and gas having two major products would <unk> the company 's <unk> to one market 's down cycle and help smooth out the flow of cash and earnings 
 as mr. roderick once said we 're a <unk> company and boy if you ca n't figure out the value of those two parts you are so damn <unk> that you do n't belong on wall street 
 moreover the opportunity to sell steel at a price acceptable to usx may be gone for now 
 the time has passed for us to spin off steel either in a public offering or to a buyer one executive contends 
 about the only way that usx now can get out of steel is to <unk> it out piece by piece in separate joint ventures he adds 
 with mr. icahn breathing down his neck however mr. corry may have little choice but to sell at a weak price even if it means losing some <unk> tax-loss <unk> 
 that would leave usx essentially an oil company with marathon as its core 
 marathon has benefited from higher <unk> prices and strong demand for refined products 
 oil has long been mr. corry 's pet 
 indeed when the bush administration finally decided this summer to renew import restrictions <unk> the most important decision to affect the steel industry in five years mr. corry and his directors were aboard <unk> high above marathon 's rich oil reserves in the north sea 
 should usx be left with only marathon mr. corry might well feel pushed to <unk> out other energy companies 
 however even usx executives who work closely with him are n't sure about his long-term goals 
 i do n't think he has a clear sense of where he wants the company to go one says 
 right now the executive adds he wants to continue to focus on paying down usx 's debt by selling assets 
 one thing is certain however mr. corry while studying other options probably wo n't make a major move until he 's clear about mr. icahn 's intentions 
 and then he wo n't panic says j. bruce johnston a former usx executive and now a labor and benefit consultant with <unk> cohen & <unk> in pittsburgh 
 mr. corry learned presence under fire when as vice president of corporate planning he handled what mr. johnston calls <unk> negotiations that led to usx 's shedding of a wide array of assets ranging from chemicals to construction 
 when negotiating mr. corry played his cards close to the <unk> 
 <unk> johnson who worked for mr. corry in strategic planning recalls how his boss would routinely ask a subordinate to research an entire industry to target acquisition candidates 
 what he really wanted to know was about a particular company but you did n't know that 
 he wanted your own <unk> virgin opinion says mr. johnson now managing director at <unk> & co. a <unk> and <unk> firm 
 ever the <unk> mr. corry said in august that he realized that usx is on acquisition screens all over the country 
 it 's part of the <unk> market system that equity can be bought and equity is bought he said 
 usx he noted was formed N years ago by in effect buying out a bunch of other companies 
 people got rich through takeovers in those days as they do today

 israel has launched a new effort to prove the <unk> liberation organization continues to practice terrorism and thus to persuade the u.s. to break off talks with the group 
 u.s. officials however said they are n't buying the israeli argument 
 israeli <unk> officials provided the state department with a <unk> list of recent terrorist incidents they attribute directly to forces controlled by plo chairman <unk> arafat 
 mr. arafat publicly <unk> terrorism dec. N satisfying the u.s. <unk> for a direct dialogue with the plo 
 a u.s. <unk> official said experts are studying the israeli list 
 we have no independent evidence linking <unk> to any acts of terrorism since dec. N N he said referring to the specific plo group that mr. arafat heads 
 so far this list does n't change our view 
 israel wants to end the dialogue but our analysts take a different view than theirs 
 israeli prime minister <unk> shamir 's top adviser on <unk> <unk> <unk> was here monday to present the report to members of congress reporters and others 
 mr. <unk> said he also presented the list last week to william brown u.s. ambassador to israel 
 separately the new york times reported that the israeli government had provided its <unk> in <unk> with different documents that israel said prove the plo has been conducting terrorism from the occupied arab <unk> 
 the state department said it has n't yet seen copies of those papers 
 if the dialogue was based on the assumption that arafat or the plo would stop terrorism and we have evidence of continued terrorism what would be the logical conclusion mr. <unk> asked 
 israel has long claimed mr. arafat never meant to <unk> terrorism particularly because he and his <unk> reserved the right to press armed struggle against the jewish state 
 now <unk> says it is backing up its <unk> with detailed accounts of alleged terrorist acts and plans linked to mr. arafat 
 it blames most of these on <unk> 
 the new accusations come at a delicate time in u.s. efforts to bring about talks between israel and palestinian representatives 
 the state department said it had received a new letter on the subject from israeli foreign minister <unk> <unk> <unk> israel 's previous <unk> to negotiating with any palestinian tied to the plo 
 deciding what <unk> terrorism can be a <unk> exercise 
 the u.s. <unk> it as <unk> politically motivated violence <unk> against <unk> targets by <unk> groups or <unk> state agents 
 to meet the u.s. criteria israel contended it only listed incidents that involved <unk> and occurred inside its <unk> borders 
 at the heart of israel 's report is a list of a dozen incidents <unk> attributes to <unk> including the use of <unk> and <unk> <unk> 
 but u.s. officials say they are n't satisfied these incidents constitute terrorism because they may be <unk> of the <unk> the palestinian <unk> in the occupied <unk> which the u.s. does n't <unk> as terrorism 
 in addition the officials say israel has n't presented convincing evidence these acts were ordered by <unk> or by any group mr. arafat controls 
 u.s. terrorism experts also say they are highly uncertain about the <unk> of the separate documents <unk> to the new york times 
 the papers which israel says were discovered in <unk> <unk> refer to terrorist acts to be carried out in the name of a group called the revolutionary <unk> 
 some supporters of israel say u.s. policy on palestinian terrorism is <unk> by an intense desire to maintain the dialogue with the plo 
 but state department officials accuse israel of <unk> questionable claims to <unk> the u.s.

 boston co. 's fall from grace is bad news for its parent shearson lehman hutton holdings inc. which has relied heavily on the banking and money management unit 's contributions in recent years 
 in N for example boston co. had an estimated pretax profit of at least $ N million while shearson managed net income of just $ N million 
 shearson does n't break out the earnings of its subsidiaries 
 but people familiar with boston co. 's performance say the unit had profit of around $ N million for the third quarter after barely breaking even for the first six months

 the <unk> exposed the company to a high degree of interest-rate risk and when rates moved <unk> beginning late last year and continuing into this year it cost them mr. <unk> said 
 mr. <unk> noted that boston safe deposit has taken some actions to better control <unk> management and improve controls in general and we think these will serve to improve credit quality 
 as some securities mature and the proceeds are reinvested the problems ought to ease he said 
 but he also cited concerns over the company 's mortgage exposure in the troubled new england real estate market 
 boston co. officials declined to comment on moody 's action or on the unit 's financial performance this year except to deny a published report that outside accountants had discovered evidence of significant accounting errors in the first three quarters ' results 
 an accounting controversy at the end of last year forced boston co. to admit it had <unk> pretax profits by some $ N million 
 the resulting scandal led to the <unk> of james n. von <unk> as boston co. 's president and to the resignations of the company 's chief financial officer and treasurer

 chicago 
 sears roebuck & co. is struggling as it enters the critical christmas season 
 yesterday the retailing and financial services giant reported a N N drop in third-quarter earnings to $ N million or N cents a share from a restated $ N million or N cents a share a year earlier 
 but the news was even worse for sears 's core u.s. retailing operation the largest in the nation 
 sears said its u.s. stores had a loss of $ N million their first deficit for the period in more than five years 
 analysts estimated that sales at u.s. stores declined in the quarter too 
 the results underscore sears 's difficulties in <unk> the everyday low pricing strategy that it adopted in march as part of a broad attempt to revive its retailing business 
 under the new approach sears set prices that were somewhere between its old regular and sale prices 
 the company said it would resort far less often to slashing prices to woo shoppers 
 sears officials insist they do n't intend to abandon the everyday pricing approach in the face of the poor results 
 instead a spokesman blames the dismal third-quarter showing on an environment that is being distorted by a very harsh climate for sales of durable goods which account for roughly two-thirds of sears 's annual merchandise volume 
 the new pricing strategy is working the spokesman asserted 
 he added that after an initial surge triggered by an advertising <unk> in march sears expected that the pricing program would n't have any effect on revenue 
 sears has been counting on growth coming from the large displays of <unk> merchandise it is adding to its stores over the next two years in what it calls power <unk> 
 but analysts say sears faces an especially <unk> challenge on the <unk> of the christmas shopping season 
 i believe everyday pricing in the current environment does n't work says walter <unk> of morgan stanley & co. pointing to soft <unk> sales 
 sears is likely to be unsuccessful if it continues with its pricing policy when everyone else is offering unusual values 
 in what amounts to an admission that the transition has n't gone as smoothly as sears had hoped the giant retailer is now trying new ways to drum up business without appearing to abandon its <unk> strategy 
 the company is <unk> more special deals in its advertising and stores and it 's offering to defer finance charges on certain <unk> items 
 sears is also stepping up its television ads and changing its message 
 in a new tv ad for instance a woman going through the sunday newspaper brands as <unk> claims by other stores that they are offering goods for N N N N and N N off 
 by lowering prices throughout its stores she says sears has the right idea 
 but the ad also <unk> sears 's sales a topic that the retailer has avoided since switching to everyday pricing 
 when sears has a sale at a special price the woman in the ad declares it 's something you do n't want to miss 
 recent surveys by leo j. shapiro & associates a market research firm in chicago suggest that sears is having a tough time attracting shoppers because it has n't yet done enough to improve service or its selection of merchandise 
 the number of people who said they were more likely to shop at sears fell in september to N N from N N in march when sears <unk> the <unk> with ads about its new pricing strategy 
 moreover the number of people who <unk> cited lower prices as the reason for their interest in sears declined to N N in september from N N in march 
 just N N of the respondents mentioned brands in september up slightly from N N in march 
 only N N of the people in september cited sears 's friendly personnel 
 the power of price as an appeal which was very considerable in driving traffic in march and april has diminished says george <unk> president of shapiro & associates 
 you see some improvement in these other areas but it 's a very small and slow process 
 for the third quarter sears said its total revenue rose N N to $ N billion from $ N billion a year earlier

 this is in response to george <unk> 's business world column the housing market is a bigger mess than you think <unk> page sept. N 
 in houston we have seen how bad the housing problem can become 
 unused houses <unk> rapidly affecting the value of nearby homes in a <unk> effect the entire neighborhood can fall victim 
 at this stage some people just walk away from homes where the mortgage exceeds current market value 
 but most of them could have <unk> to keep up their payments they chose not to do so 
 the problem is so vast that we need to try innovative solutions in <unk> experiments 
 here are some ideas 
 N foreclosed homes could be sold by the fha for no down payment the biggest obstacle to young buyers but with personal liability for the mortgage no walking away by choice 
 N encourage long-term <unk> by <unk> one month 's payment off the <unk> end of the mortgage for every six months paid or perhaps have the down payment deferred to the end of the mortgage balloon but <unk> on a monthly <unk> basis as long as the owner remains the <unk> 
 N develop rental agreements with exclusive purchase options for the <unk> 
 an <unk> will in most every case be better for the home and neighborhood than a vacant house 
 in this way the house is not dumped on to a <unk> market 
 john f. merrill

 worse the properties then sit around deteriorating for maybe a year or so but are <unk> eventually because of the <unk> of the low down payment etc to a marginal buyer who ca n't afford both the mortgage and needed repairs and having little vested interest that buyer will walk away and the vicious cycle <unk> itself all over again

 new orders for durable goods fell back slightly in september after shooting up the month before reflecting weakening auto demand after a <unk> of orders for new N models the commerce department reported 
 orders for military equipment household appliances machinery and other goods expected to last at least three years dipped N N last month to $ N billion after leaping N N in august the department said 
 most analysts had expected a sharper decline after the steep rise in august 
 moreover a recent government report showing widespread layoffs in manufacturing had contributed to perceptions that the manufacturing sector of the economy had slowed to a <unk> 
 but many economists pointed to a N N september rise in orders outside the volatile transportation category 
 that suggests the manufacturing sector is not falling apart said <unk> <unk> an economist at manufacturers hanover securities corp. in new york 
 she added however it is not robust by any means 
 while a decline in orders for cars and civilian airplanes pulled down the orders total an enormous jump in orders for heavy military equipment <unk> it up

 orders for military goods usually <unk> in september government officials say as the pentagon <unk> to spend its money before the new fiscal year begins oct. N 
 while all the numbers in the durable goods report were adjusted for seasonal fluctuations a commerce department analyst said that the adjustment probably did n't factor out all of the <unk> surge in defense orders 
 without the increase in defense bookings september orders would have plummeted N N 
 analysts were most unsettled by evidence the backlog of orders at factories is slipping 
 unfilled orders for durable goods rose N N in september to $ N billion after declining for the first time in N N years in august 
 in july unfilled orders grew N N 
 but analysts noted that excluding transportation where what they believe was a temporary surge in auto demand pushed up the figures order backlogs have declined for three months in a row 
 it means we 're eating into the bread that keeps us going 
 that is a little disturbing ms. <unk> said 
 it also means if you have a real <unk> in orders production will likely fall off very quickly because there is less to keep things going 
 capital goods orders outside of the defense sector tumbled for the second month in a row posting a N N drop after a N N decline 
 such steep drops in a category seen as a barometer of business investment would <unk> be grave news for the economy 
 but a commerce department analyst said that in both months orders would have risen had it not been for a drop in civilian aircraft bookings a category that is showing declines only after a huge surge earlier this year

 japan has climbed up from the <unk> of world war ii and a gross national product of about $ N per capita to reach the <unk> class among industrialized nations 
 now this remarkable economic growth seems to be coming to an end because the government has not converted itself into a modern democratic developed nation mode of operation 
 until N when japan joined the $ N per capita gnp club of the advanced countries it was a model developing nation 
 the government built ports bridges highways schools hospitals and <unk> 
 when industries were weak it protected them 
 it gave the japanese people a value system based on the <unk> that given the country 's lack of natural resources they must work hard to create value through exports and buy food with the surplus 
 individual prosperity inevitably would result 
 that system has worked 
 the standard of living has increased steadily over the past N years more than N N of the people consider themselves middle class 
 the people have given their leading and only credible political party the liberal democratic party clear and <unk> power for those N years 
 the ldp won by a <unk> in the last election in july N 
 but less than two years later the ldp started to <unk> and dissent rose to unprecedented heights 
 the symptoms all point to one thing japan does not have a modern government 
 its government still wants to sit in the driver 's seat set the speed step on the gas apply the <unk> and steer with N million people in the back seat 
 in a modern system the government 's role is to give the people as much choice as possible and to keep them well informed so they are capable of making a choice 
 it also allows people to buy the best and the cheapest goods from anywhere in the world 
 the japanese government does n't allow this 
 the ministry of agriculture and <unk> actually is a ministry for farmers and <unk> instead of a ministry of provisions 
 the ministry of health and welfare is a ministry of doctors and pharmaceutical companies rather than an organization dedicated to protecting the health of the people 
 the ministry of education is nothing but a <unk> for licensed teachers and certainly does not act on behalf of students 
 the ministry of construction spreads concrete throughout the country and boasts in international conferences that japan 's <unk> roadway per capita is the longest in the world but they seldom think of the poor commuters who spend so much time sitting in traffic 
 the ministry of transportation serves the industry certainly not the passengers who must pay extraordinarily high prices 
 and the ministry of foreign affairs works for itself supporting japanese diplomats who <unk> abundant aid money around the world to ensure that their seat at the dinner table is next to the host 's 
 this ministry has done nothing to correct the <unk> and <unk> that are at the root of japan 's deteriorating image 
 instead it seems to be using foreign pressure and even the trade conflict to expand its <unk> of influence <unk> a <unk> other ministries 
 all this illustrates that japanese ministries still have a provider mentality they do not serve the people and particularly not consumers 
 they serve the industries and the special-interest groups 
 the rest of the world accepted such methods when japan was developing 
 japanese put up with it because the government provided job stability and growing <unk> 
 japan is not a political country 
 it is a bureaucratic country 
 the diet plays a minor role compared with the powerful bureaucratic system 
 most bills are drafted by bureaucrats not politicians 
 the diet does n't normally even debate bills because the opposition parties are so often opposed to whatever ldp does that it would be a waste of time 
 so most bills are passed without full discussion particularly difficult bills are passed in the absence of the opposition parties 
 a recent example is the N N consumption tax on all commercial activities 
 this makes enormous sense in japan where direct tax accounts for more than N N of revenues and the capture rate of direct tax is so unfair 
 if you are a <unk> man <unk> N N captured 
 if you are a retailer N N and a farmer N N 
 to correct this <unk> most people would have favored an indirect tax like the consumption tax 
 but the bill was passed without debate in the diet in the absence of the opposition 
 as a result the japanese people did n't know what to expect when the new law was introduced on april N 
 they were frustrated by the longer <unk> at the <unk> and the small coins given as change 
 all of a sudden prices were no longer in denominations of N or N 
 they were N or N 
 pockets exploded with <unk> coins 
 while people were <unk> their change the ldp politicians were caught in scandals 
 money such as in recruit 's political donations and women as in the cases of prime minister <unk> <unk> and secretary general <unk> <unk> seldom have caused political scandals in japan 
 <unk> most men were a bit <unk> about the sex scandals though they were <unk> about recruit women were upset about both and surged to the polls 
 in the recent upper house and tokyo metropolitan congressional elections in which the socialist party won a runaway victory N N of all women voted as opposed to the usual N N 
 it is difficult to analyze how much of their anger was due to recruit the sex scandals or the <unk> coins in their <unk> but they obviously were voting to punish the ldp 
 taken by surprise the socialist party is busy changing its <unk> 
 it 's now ok to deal with the u.s. but not the soviet union 
 nuclear power plants are acceptable 
 the <unk> security treaty can continue sort of 
 and so on 
 against the rapid cosmetic overhaul of the socialist party the ldp has been <unk> 
 now is the time to reform the government from a provider developing-country vanguard role to that of a modern industrialized nation in which consumers have the ultimate choice 
 if the ldp as currently composed ca n't make the <unk> then it should split into two parties 
 one party could stand for consumer interests small government free trade and <unk> to put japan clearly among the most developed and open countries 
 the other party could continue on the traditional track of the ldp representing the manufacturers ' preference for larger government control regulation and <unk> 
 the ldp must make a decision immediately lower house elections must take place before june 
 in the current mood of the japanese people journalists and even some <unk> giving power to the <unk> might be good for the ldp <unk> it of past <unk> 
 we must not forget however that such a <unk> political experiment could cause a global <unk> wave of shocks in real-estate and financial markets 
 at the most there is only nine months before the ldp <unk> burns out

 a good delicious can indeed be delicious 
 more than twice as many red delicious apples are grown as the golden variety america 's no. N apple 
 but the apple industry is <unk> for change 
 red delicious has been <unk> and its prices have dropped below the cost of production says washington state 's mr. norton 
 the scare over <unk> a growth regulator that makes apples <unk> and <unk> but may be <unk> made consumers shy away from the delicious though they were less affected than the <unk> 
 the <unk> and <unk> lower prices combined with cancer fears was a very serious blow to growers

 supermarkets are getting into the variety act too 
 they still buy apples mainly for big red good looks that 's why so many taste like <unk> ' <unk> bags 
 but <unk> counts more than it once did and stores are expanding shelf space for <unk> but <unk> and often <unk> apples 
 rather than sell <unk> delicious maybe we can sell <unk> fujis says chuck <unk> <unk> director for <unk> <unk> inc. a minneapolis supermarket chain and food distributor 
 the fuji is a product of <unk> japanese <unk> engineering which <unk> it N years ago at a government research <unk>

 the japanese apple market is very <unk> to high quality says david lane a scientist at a canadian <unk> research center in <unk> british columbia and so apples are more of a <unk> there than a big food commodity 
 the u.s. department of agriculture estimates that this year americans will eat about N N more fresh apples per capita than the japanese

 mr. <unk> the washington grower says that he could sell fujis to taiwan buyers at $ N a box if he had them 
 taiwan already is a big importer of fujis from other places he adds 
 but his first crop wo n't be picked till next year 
 i expect to see the demand exceed supply for fujis for the next N to N years he adds 
 washington red delicious by the way are <unk> for less than $ N a box these days 
 mr. <unk> sees fujis in part as striking a blow against the <unk> of u.s. apples by supermarkets 
 when the chain stores took over there was no longer a connection between grower and consumer 
 a guy is sitting up in an office deciding what you 're going to eat 
 after all until the 1950s even the red delicious was a firm <unk> <unk> 
 then as growers <unk> them more for looks and to satisfy supermarket chains ' demands of long-term storage the red went into decline 
 now those red <unk> things stores sell in summer are <unk> lovely but usually not good eating 
 they do deserve respect however they are almost a year old probably equal to about N in human years 
 the fuji to be sure has <unk> too 
 it <unk> later than most apples and growing it in u.s. areas with <unk> <unk> may be tricky 
 moreover the <unk> fuji must compete with an increasingly <unk> delicious 
 mr. broderick the massachusetts grower says the big boss at a supermarket chain even rejected his red delicious recently because they were n't <unk> and brushed for extra <unk> 
 and he had n't used <unk> which many growers employ to <unk> their delicious apples for greater eye appeal 
 still mr. <unk> points out <unk> became popular without big red looks so why not fujis 
 he sees a shift in american values at least regarding apples toward more emphasis on substance and less on <unk>

 few people are aware that the federal government <unk> almost as much money as it <unk> 
 from N to N while federal budget deficits totaled $ N trillion the government issued $ N billion of new direct loans and an additional $ N billion of new primary loan guarantees

 federal credit programs date back to the new deal and were meant to break even financially 
 since the 1950s federal lending has experienced extraordinary growth in credit volume subsidy rates and policy applications spurred on by the growth of government in general and budget <unk> and deceptive management in particular 
 as we will see many of these obligations do n't show up as part of the federal deficit 
 but recent events indicate that federal credit is out of control 
 student loan defaults remain high at about N N and the program has been rocked by allegations of fraud and <unk> 
 farmers home administration <unk> loans have turned into de <unk> <unk> programs losses over the next three years are expected to exceed $ N billion 
 defaults on veterans affairs loan guarantees have <unk> in the past eight years 
 last month the general accounting office reported that defaults in federal housing administration guarantees were five times as high as previously estimated and that fha 's equity fell to minus $ N billion 
 <unk> 's findings are particularly troubling because the fha has about $ N billion in obligations outstanding and had previously been considered one of the most financially secure credit programs 
 scores of other credit programs subsidizing agriculture small business exporters defense energy transportation and others are less visible but in no better shape 
 if the programs continue their present path the potential government losses are staggering the federal government holds $ N billion in direct loans outstanding and backs an additional $ N billion in primary guarantees 
 secondary guarantees of pools of fha and <unk> loans by the agency known as ginnie mae currently exceed $ N billion 
 although external events have contributed to the <unk> the principal causes of the current crisis are internal and generic to all programs 
 to reduce the risks while still retaining the legitimate benefits these programs can provide credit policy must N use credit to improve the operation of capital markets not to provide subsidies 
 there is a fundamental conflict between providing a subsidy and maintaining the integrity of a credit program 
 if the program is meant to provide a subsidy collecting the debt <unk> the original goal 
 thus subsidized loans tend to turn into <unk> programs with increasing subsidy and default rates over time 
 to avoid this problem government should issue credit only if it intends to use every legal method to collect 
 in contrast credit programs can be appropriate tools to improve the operation of capital markets 
 for example legal restrictions on interstate banking once <unk> the supply of credit to the agricultural sector 
 farm lending was enacted to correct this problem by providing a <unk> flow of <unk> funds 
 however this in no way justifies the huge government subsidies and losses on such loans 
 credit policy should separate these two competing objectives and eliminate aspects that provide the subsidy 
 for example student loans currently attempt to subsidize college attendance and <unk> problems created by the fact that students ' future earnings are not accepted as collateral 
 the program provides highly subsidized loans to any student whose family earns less than a particular amount 
 high default rates a low interest rate and government coverage of all interest costs while the student is in school make program costs extremely high 
 families that do not need the loan can make money simply by putting the loan in the bank and paying it back when the student graduates 
 in contrast a student loan program that was meant solely to correct <unk> <unk> would allow loans for any student regardless of family income at market or <unk> rates 
 while the student was in school interest costs would either be paid by the student or added to the loan balance 
 this program combined with cash grants to <unk> students would reduce program costs and much more effectively target the intended beneficiaries 
 N provide better incentives 
 given the structure of most credit programs it is surprising that default rates are not even higher 
 guarantee rates are typically N N giving lenders little reason to screen customers carefully 
 reducing those rates moderately say to N N would still provide substantial assistance to borrowers 
 but it would also encourage lenders to choose more <unk> customers and go a long way toward reducing defaults 
 for example the small business administration has had reasonable success in reducing both guarantee rates and default rates in its preferred lenders ' program 
 borrowers ' incentives are equally <unk> 
 since the government has a dismal record of collecting bad debts the costs to the <unk> of <unk> are usually low 
 in addition it is often possible to obtain a new government loan even if existing debts are not paid off 
 simple policy <unk> in this case would be to improve debt collection taking the <unk> off contracted collection agencies and to deny new credit to <unk> 
 these provisions would be difficult to enforce for a program intended to provide a subsidy but would be reasonable and effective devices for programs that attempt to offset market <unk> 
 N record the true costs of credit programs in the federal budget 
 since the budget measures cash flow a new $ N direct loan is treated as a $ N expenditure even though at least part of the loan will be paid back 
 loan guarantees do n't appear at all until the <unk> defaults so new guarantees do not raise the deficit even though they create future liabilities for the government 
 by converting an expenditure or loan to a guarantee the government can ensure the same flow of resources and reduce the current deficit 
 predictably guarantees outstanding have risen by $ N billion since N while direct loans outstanding have fallen by $ N billion 
 the true budgetary cost of a credit subsidy is the discounted value of the net costs to government 
 this figure could be estimated using techniques employed by private lenders to forecast losses or determined by selling loans to private owners without federal guarantees 
 neither technique is perfect but both are better than the current system which <unk> the costs of new credit programs by amounts that vary substantially and average about $ N billion annually according to the congressional budget office 
 a budget that reflected the real costs of lending would eliminate incentives to convert spending or lending programs to guarantees and would let taxpayers know what congress is committing them to 
 N impose standard accounting and administrative practices 
 creative accounting is a <unk> of federal credit 
 many agencies roll over their debt paying off <unk> loans by issuing new loans or converting defaulted loan guarantees into direct loans 
 in any case they avoid having to write off the loans 
 some agencies simply keep bad loans on the books as late as N the <unk> bank held in its portfolio at face value loans made to cuba in the 1950s 
 more seriously <unk> has carried several billion dollars of defaulted loans at face value 
 until <unk> 's recent audit fha books had not been subject to a complete external audit in N years 
 the administration of federal credit should closely parallel private lending practices including the development of a loan loss reserve and regular outside audits 
 establishing these practices would permit earlier <unk> of emerging financial crises provide better information for loan sales and <unk> decisions and reduce fraud 
 government lending was not intended to be a way to <unk> spending figures hide fraudulent activity or provide large subsidies 
 the reforms described above would provide a more limited but <unk> safer and ultimately more useful role for government as a lender 
 without such reforms credit programs will continue to be a large-scale high-risk proposition for taxpayers

 president bush is considering casting a line-item veto as a test to determine whether the courts will rule that he has such authority

 mr. <unk> seeking to <unk> european objections to an earlier u.s. plan that called for eliminating all <unk> barriers by the year N said the new u.s. proposal would n't put farmers out of business but would only encourage them to grow what the markets desire instead of what the government wants

 another u.s. proposal filed monday urges more fair play in services trade including predictable and clear rules and <unk> in the treatment of foreign and domestic service companies 
 unlike the earlier u.s. <unk> proposal which struck european countries as too extreme the latest plan would provide some room for maneuver 
 for instance the new u.s. package makes clear there would be a transition period during which gatt members could use a combination of tariffs and quotas to cushion their farmers from foreign competition 
 it also says countries could temporarily raise tariffs on certain products if they experience an unusually heavy volume of imports 
 instead of proposing a complete elimination of farm subsidies as the earlier u.s. proposal did the new package calls for the elimination of only the most <unk> ones 
 less <unk> ones would be subject only to some restraints and others with a relatively minor trade impact would be allowed to continue under certain conditions 
 the new u.s. plan also would establish procedures to prevent countries from using health and <unk> rules to <unk> trade <unk> 
 the goal would be to resolve disputes such as one prompted by the european community 's current attempt to bar imports of beef from <unk> u.s. cattle

 the voting rights act of N was enacted to keep the promise of the <unk> amendment and enable southern blacks to go to the polls <unk> by <unk> tests and other <unk> devices 
 <unk> years later the voting rights act has been transformed by the courts and the justice department into a program of racial gerrymandering designed to increase the number of blacks and other minorities hispanics <unk> and native americans holding <unk> office 
 in the 1980s the justice department and lower federal courts that enforce the voting rights act have required state legislatures and municipal governments to create the maximum number of safe minority election districts districts where minorities form between N N and N N of the voting population 
 the program has even been called upon to create safe white electoral districts in municipalities where whites are the minority 
 although section N of the act <unk> <unk> requiring that minorities win a <unk> share of <unk> offices few municipal and state government plans achieve <unk> by the justice department or survive the scrutiny of the lower federal courts unless they <unk> out as many <unk> minority districts as possible 
 the new goal of the voting rights act more minorities in political office is <unk> 
 for the political process to work all citizens regardless of race must feel represented 
 one essential indicator that they are is that members of minority groups get elected to public office with reasonable frequency 
 as is blacks constitute N N of the population but fewer than N N of elected leaders 
 but racial gerrymandering is not the best way to accomplish that essential goal 
 it is a quick fix for a complex problem 
 far from promoting a <unk> of interests among black white hispanic and other minority voters drawing the district lines according to race suggests that race is the voter 's and the candidate 's most important <unk> 
 such a policy implies that only a black politician can speak for a black person and that only a white politician can govern on behalf of a white one 
 examples of the divisive effects of racial gerrymandering can be seen in two cities new york and birmingham <unk> 
 when they <unk> their districts after the N census every other <unk> and state in the country will face this issue 
 new york city 
 racial gerrymandering has been a familiar policy in new york city since N when congress first amended the voting rights act to expand its reach beyond the southern states 
 in N the justice department required that the electoral <unk> in the borough of brooklyn be <unk> to concentrate black and hispanic votes despite protests that the new electoral <unk> would split a neighborhood of <unk> <unk> into two different districts 
 this year a commission appointed by the mayor to revise new york 's system of government completed a new charter expanding the city council to N from N members 
 sometime in N as soon as the N census becomes available a <unk> panel will <unk> the city council district lines 
 the charter revision commission has made it clear that in response to the expectations of the justice department and the commission 's own commitment to <unk> minority political leadership the new district lines will be drawn to maximize the number of <unk> minority districts 
 blacks and hispanics currently make up N N of the city 's population and hold only N N of the seats on the council 
 several of the city 's black leaders including democratic mayoral <unk> david dinkins have spoken out for racial gerrymandering to accord blacks and hispanics the <unk> opportunity for representation 
 in this connection it is important to note that several members of new york 's sitting city council represent <unk> districts that bring together sizable black hispanic and <unk> white <unk> <unk> <unk> 's <unk> district in northern manhattan and the south bronx and susan alter 's <unk> district in brooklyn for example 
 to win their seats on the council these political leaders have had to listen to all the voices in their district and devise public policies that would benefit all 
 often they have found that the relevant issue is not race but rather housing crime prevention or education 
 birmingham ala. 
 the unusual situation in birmingham <unk> illustrates the divisive consequences of <unk> out safe districts for racial minorities 
 in birmingham which is N N black whites are the minority 
 insisting that they are protected by the voting rights act a group of whites brought a federal suit in N to demand that the city abandon <unk> voting for the nine member city council and create nine electoral districts including four safe white districts 
 the white group argued that whites were not fully and fairly represented because in <unk> elections only black candidates or white candidates who <unk> to black interests could win 
 no federal court has ruled that the voting rights act protects a white minority but in june the justice department approved a <unk> plan for birmingham that <unk> out three <unk> districts and six <unk> districts 
 richard <unk> birmingham 's black mayor <unk> the consequences 
 in the past people who had to run for office had to moderate their views because they could n't afford to <unk> blacks or whites he said 
 now you go to districts you 're likely to get candidates whose views are more extreme white and black on racial issues 
 two hundred years ago critics of the new united states constitution warned that the electoral districts for congress were too large and <unk> too many different economic interests 
 a small farmer and a <unk> merchant could not be represented by the same spokesman they said 
 but james madison <unk> that argument in one of the most <unk> political <unk> ever written no. N of the <unk> papers 
 madison explained that a representative 's duty was to speak not for the narrow interests of one group but instead for the common good 
 large <unk> election districts would encourage good government said madison because a representative would be <unk> to serve the interests of all his constituents and be <unk> to none 
 madison 's noble and <unk> vision of the representative still can guide us 
 as long as we believe that all americans of every race and ethnic background have common interests and can live together <unk> our political <unk> should reflect our belief 
 racial gerrymandering creating separate black and white districts says that we have discarded that belief in our ability to live together and govern ourselves as one people 
 ms. <unk> is a constitutional scholar at the center for the study of the presidency in new york 
 the justice department has distributed these new guidelines for u.s. attorneys <unk> rico cases 
 a related editorial appears today 
 under rico the government may seek a temporary <unk> order tro upon the filing of a rico indictment in order to preserve all <unk> assets until the trial is completed and judgment entered 
 such orders can have a <unk> impact on third parties who do business with the defendants including clients vendors banks investors creditors dependents and others 
 some highly publicized cases involving rico <unk> have been the subject of considerable criticism in the press because of a perception that pre-trial <unk> of assets is <unk> to a seizure of property without due process 
 in order to ensure that the rights of all interested parties are protected the criminal division has instituted the following requirements to control the use of <unk> in rico prosecutions 
 it should be noted that these requirements are in addition to any other existing requirements such as review by the asset forfeiture office 
 N as part of the approval process for rico prosecutions the prosecutor must submit any proposed forfeiture tro for review by the organized crime and racketeering section 
 the prosecutor must show that <unk> <unk> such as bonds are not likely to preserve the assets for forfeiture in the event of a conviction 
 N in seeking approval of a tro the prosecutor must <unk> any anticipated impact that forfeiture and the tro would have on innocent third parties balanced against the government 's need to preserve the assets 
 N in deciding whether forfeiture and hence a tro is appropriate the section will consider the nature and <unk> of the <unk> the government 's policy is not to seek the <unk> forfeiture permissible under the law where that forfeiture would be disproportionate to the defendant 's crime 
 the division expects that the prosecutor will announce these principles either at the time the indictment is returned or at the latest at the first proceeding before the court concerning the tro 
 sales of north <unk> cars and trucks plunged N N in mid-october from a year earlier as domestic manufacturers paid the price for heavy incentives earlier this year 
 people are waiting for new factory <unk> said ben <unk> sales manager of bob <unk> auto world in lynn mass. whose sales are slow 
 this trend appears to be especially true at general motors corp. which used both dealer and consumer incentives to <unk> sales in august and september 
 since then deliveries have slumped 
 gm 's car sales dropped N N in mid-october to N while truck sales fell N N to N 
 gm also had dismal results in the first N days of the month while other auto makers reported mixed results 
 all of the big three suffered in the <unk> period however with sales of all domestically made cars including those built at <unk> plants falling N N to N from a year earlier 
 the seasonal adjusted annual selling rate was six million vehicles a small improvement from the N million rate of early october but a big drop from the N million rate a year ago 
 sales of domestically made trucks also continued to be sluggish in mid-october dropping N N to N from a year ago 
 the big three auto makers already have slashed fourth-quarter production plans N N below year-ago levels but that may not be enough to prevent inventories from ballooning if sales do n't improve 
 industry analyst john h. <unk> a vice president with hill & <unk> in st. louis forecasts that domestic auto makers will have a <unk> supply of cars at the end of the year even if car sales improve to a N million vehicle rate for the quarter 
 ford motor co. reported a N N drop in sales of <unk> cars to N and a N N drop in domestic trucks to N 
 the sales are being dragged down by a <unk> of N vehicles said joel <unk> a ford analyst 
 the earlier use of incentives <unk> the market of <unk> for <unk> N cars he said 
 town & country ford in charlotte n.c. still needs to move about N N cars and trucks 
 business had been fairly strong until hurricane hugo hit the area but has been down since 
 chrysler corp. also hit the rocks in mid-october 
 the no. N u.s. auto maker had a N N plunge in car sales to N and a N N drop in truck sales to N which include its minivans and <unk> 
 honda motor co. which continues to have short supplies of domestically made accords saw its sales of north <unk> cars fall N N to N 
 but sales of domestic cars and trucks at nissan motor corp. rose N N to N 
 a nissan spokesman attributed the increase to the use of incentives this year and not a year ago and to higher fleet sales 
 toyota motor corp. which opened a plant in <unk> ky. last year saw sales triple to N vehicles 
 a totals include only vehicle sales reported in the period 
 c domestic car 
 d percent change greater than N N

 short interest in nasdaq over-the-counter stocks rose N N as of mid-october its biggest jump since N N last april 
 the most recent otc short interest statistics were compiled oct. N the day the nasdaq composite index slid N N and the new york stock exchange tumbled N N 
 the <unk> might lead to the conclusion that <unk> bet heavily on that day that otc stocks would decline further 
 as it happens the nasdaq composite did continue to fall for two days after the initial plunge 
 however the short interest figures reported by brokerage and securities clearing firms to the national association of securities dealers include only those trades completed or settled by oct. N rather than trades that occurred on that day according to gene <unk> chief economist for the nasd 
 generally it takes five business days to transfer stock and to take the other steps necessary to settle a trade 
 the total short interest in nasdaq stocks as of mid-october was N million shares up from N million in september but well below the record level of N million shares established in july N 
 the sharp rise in otc short interest compares with the N N decline in short interest on the new york stock exchange and the N N rise on the american stock exchange during the <unk> period 
 generally a short seller expects a fall in a stock 's price and aims to profit by selling borrowed shares that are to be replaced later the short seller hopes the replacement shares bought later will cost less than those that were sold 
 short interest which represents the number of shares borrowed and sold but not yet replaced can be a <unk> barometer for many stocks 
 among N of the largest otc issues short interest rose to N million shares from N million in N stocks in september 
 big stocks with large short interest gains as of oct. N included first executive intel campeau and lin broadcasting 
 short interest in first executive an insurance issue rose N N to N million 
 intel 's short interest jumped N N while campeau 's increased N N 
 intel makes semiconductors and campeau operates department-store chains and is <unk> for cash 
 <unk> savings again had the dubious honor of being the otc stock with the biggest short interest position on nasdaq 
 <unk> has headed the list since may 
 first executive and troubled valley national corp. of arizona were next in line 
 short selling is n't necessarily bad for the overall market 
 <unk> shares must eventually be replaced through buying 
 in addition changes in short interest in some stocks may be caused by arbitrage 
 for example an investor may seek to profit during some takeover situations by buying stock in one company involved and <unk> the stock of the other 
 two big stocks involved in takeover activity saw their short interest surge 
 short interest in the american depositary receipts of jaguar the target of both ford motor and general motors more than doubled 
 nasdaq stocks that showed a drop in short interest included adobe systems class a shares of tele-communications and takeover targets <unk> and <unk> 
 the nasd which operates the nasdaq computer system on which N otc issues trade <unk> short interest data in two categories the approximately two-thirds and generally biggest nasdaq stocks that trade on the national market system and the one-third and generally smaller nasdaq stocks that are n't a part of the system 
 short interest in N <unk> securities totaled N million shares compared with almost N million shares in N issues in september 
 the october short interest represents N days of average daily trading volume in the smaller stocks in the system for the reporting period compared with N day a month ago 
 among bigger otc stocks the figures represent N days of average daily volume compared with N days in september

 from the sept. <unk> N issue of the economist 
 what defeated general aoun was not only the weight of the syrian army 
 the weight of lebanon 's history was also against him and it is a history israel is in danger of <unk> 
 like lebanon and however unfairly israel is regarded by the arab world as a colonial <unk> 
 its best hope of acceptance by its <unk> lies in reaching a settlement with the <unk> 
 like lebanon israel is being <unk> by <unk> 
 in greater israel more than half the children under six are <unk> 
 within N years <unk> will probably be the minority 
 yet israel will neither share power with all these arabs nor says its present prime minister <unk> its borders closer to its <unk> jewish <unk> 
 by not choosing one of these options <unk> will condemn themselves as the <unk> did to perpetual war with the <unk> in their midst and so to the internal erosion of their state 
 unlike the <unk> israel 's <unk> will not let themselves become the weakest force in a system of private <unk> <unk> will become <unk> before it becomes <unk> 
 but that is not much of a <unk> to draw from the failure of general aoun 
 the nasdaq over-the-counter market did n't fully recover from a selling <unk> and closed down N N 
 the effects on the market of the mostly computer-driven sell-off among <unk> stocks <unk> many market makers who watched the nasdaq composite index tumble in <unk> with the dow jones industrial average and then saw it get left behind in the subsequent rally 
 after <unk> N N at one point during the day the composite rebounded a little but finished down N at N 
 in contrast the industrial average recovered almost completely from its <unk> and closed down N N 
 the new york stock exchange composite was N N lower for the day

 mci traded as low as N N during the session 
 other active stocks included jaguar whose american depositary receipts added N to N N

 the market started with several strikes against it said peter dapuzzo head of retail equity trading at shearson lehman hutton referring to news that the labor-management buy-out of ual corp. continued to <unk> and reports that the junk-bond market is <unk> 
 but the computer-guided selling in response to those developments dealt a serious blow to the over-the-counter market mr. dapuzzo said 
 even though the over-the-counter market usually does n't fall by as much as listed stocks during <unk> <unk> he said when the market does recover the damage is done and it leaves nasdaq down more than the big board 
 mr. dapuzzo also complained that the sharp swings in stock prices lately is scaring away retail and foreign investors 
 while shearson does n't do computer-guided program trading for its own account the firm does execute orders for clients involved in the buying and selling of shares tied to movements in certain stock indexes mr. dapuzzo acknowledged 
 the volatility inherent in program trading troubled other traders too 
 they do n't like the risks they are forced to assume when prices swing so drastically 
 market makers are supposed to keep supplies of stocks on hand to maintain orderly trading when imbalances occur 
 that means that on days when prices are tumbling and sellers <unk> they must be willing to buy shares from sellers when no one else will 
 in such an environment a market maker can absorb huge losses 
 but the recent volatility in stock prices caused by the program trading has made some market makers less willing to <unk> up the stocks that are for sale 
 the market makers say they are n't comfortable carrying big positions in stocks because they realize prices can tumble quickly 
 the situation makes it harder to buy and sell shares quickly <unk> the rise and fall in stock prices during <unk> trading 
 <unk> robert <unk> head of over-the-counter trading at donaldson lufkin & jenrette it 's making it tough for traders to make money

 arms control reality nov. N N the first of some N journal <unk> saying that krasnoyarsk violated the abm treaty 
 whether the installation is for early warning or space track it clearly is not deployed the lawmakers said

 the washington post sept. N N 
 the u.s.s.r. has taken unprecedented <unk> measures of openness by giving american representatives a possibility to <unk> the building site of the krasnoyarsk radar as well as radar vans in the areas of <unk> and moscow so as to see for themselves that there are no violations of the abm treaty of N on the part of the soviet union 
 letter from eduard shevardnadze to u.n. <unk> <unk> de <unk> reported in tass june N N 
 the construction of this station equal in size to the egyptian <unk> <unk> i say it directly a clear violation of abm 
 eduard shevardnadze oct. N N 
 we 're happy we guess to receive confirmation of the krasnoyarsk violation from the soviets five years after we started writing about it 
 perhaps even the american <unk> will now <unk> 
 without question something intriguing is going on in the policy chambers of the politburo 
 as it bids for new agreements new loans and indeed admission to the <unk> world the soviet government has recognized it has a credibility problem 
 so after N years it is <unk> the obvious hoping to be believed about other things 
 it 's not enough 
 if the soviets want to be believed they need to start telling the truth about more than the totally obvious 
 our own test of glasnost 's <unk> would be a soviet decision to open itself to a complete international examination of one of the most troubling <unk> in u.s.-soviet relations the reported N anthrax <unk> at a soviet military facility in sverdlovsk 
 the u.s. government has never <unk> in its assessment of this incident as an accident at a biological weapons facility there and hence a violation of the N biological weapons convention 
 the pentagon 's recently issued soviet military power though in general adopting a softer line repeated the sverdlovsk assessment 
 it also was detailed in congressional testimony this past february an explosion at the <unk> and <unk> institute in sverdlovsk released anthrax <unk> that caused a significant number of deaths 
 since mr. shevardnadze did not address this topic before the supreme soviet the soviet union 's official position remains that the anthrax deaths were caused by tainted meat 
 we doubt this claim just as we <unk> mr. shevardnadze 's assurance last year that krasnoyarsk did n't violate the abm treaty 
 and just as we did not believe the <unk> claims of the congressmen and arms-control advocates who visited krasnoyarsk we are in no way persuaded by the <unk> to the <unk> theory by a u.s. team of scientists who met with soviet counterparts in washington last year 
 the soviets ' explanation is that the anthrax came from one lot of animal feed made from the <unk> of cattle that <unk> on soil that was naturally infected with anthrax <unk> 
 harvard 's <unk> <unk> who we read has sold something called the scientific community on the notion that yellow rain attacks on the <unk> <unk> were in fact the result of <unk> <unk> by giant <unk> found the soviet anthrax scenario completely <unk> 
 we do n't believe it 
 and we certainly do not believe that mr. gorbachev or any of his <unk> yet deserve to have the west take their word for it 
 sverdlovsk is a large gray cloud over glasnost and indeed over the legitimacy of the arms-control process itself 
 the u.s. government 's sverdlovsk complaint as with krasnoyarsk is no mere political <unk> 
 biological weapons violations have figured little in political debate and indeed have not been pressed vigorously enough by the u.s. government 
 but the stated u.s. position is detailed and specific and the prospect of biological <unk> is <unk> <unk> 
 the soviets should be willing to set in motion a process that would allow them to acknowledge that sverdlovsk violated the N agreement or alternatively that would give u.s. specialists reasonable confidence that this was a wholly civilian accident 
 until that happens glasnost can not begin to deserve the kind of credibility mr. shevardnadze was bidding for with his <unk> on monday 
 manville corp. said it offered to buy $ N million of its convertible preferred stock from the manville personal injury settlement trust in a move that would improve the trust 's liquidity and reduce the potential number of manville shares outstanding 
 manville said it made the offer within the past several weeks as part of an effort to improve shareholder value 
 it said it would purchase the stock at market price 
 manville and a spokeswoman for the trust said that the two are discussing the proposal but a decision has n't been made 
 we are considering that offer along with all other alternatives the trust spokeswoman said 
 we need to look at how to maximize our cash flow to pay our beneficiaries 
 the trust created as part of manville 's bankruptcy-law reorganization to compensate victims of <unk> diseases owns N million of the series a convertible preferred shares which are each convertible into N manville common shares 
 the trust also owns half of manville 's N million common shares outstanding 
 based on manville 's closing price yesterday of $ N a share manville 's offer would purchase about N million of its preferred shares or about N N of the trust 's preferred stock holding 
 in addition to the stock and N N of manville 's profits beginning in N the trust is supposed to receive $ N billion over its <unk> life 
 but it initially was funded with about $ N million and may soon face a cash crunch 
 as of june N it had settled about N of N claims filed and its unpaid claims totaled $ N million a large portion of its $ N million in cash and <unk> securities 
 since most of its assets are tied to manville a forest and building products concern the trust might also want to diversify its holdings 
 as part of its offer manville said it requested changes in some <unk> between it and the trust to allow manville to reflect a more typical corporate ownership and financial structure 
 a manville spokesman would n't elaborate on the proposed changes 
 but he said they are to a large degree <unk> although some may generate some disagreement 
 manville said the shares issued to the trust were intended to be sold as needed and that manville has the right of first refusal to buy those shares 
 northeast utilities raised its bid for public service co. of new hampshire which is operating under bankruptcy code protection to $ N billion from $ N billion 
 northeast 's raised bid which was supported by ps of new hampshire 's official shareholder committee is a prelude to what is expected to be a round of higher bids by the other groups trying to acquire the company the largest utility in new hampshire

 some of the three other bidding groups are expected to increase their offers tomorrow a date set for revised offers by a bankruptcy court judge 
 a hearing is set for nov. N but participants do n't expect a resolution until july N 
 under the new northeast utilities plan it would pay $ N billion in cash to creditors and assume $ N million in pollution control bonds 
 secured creditors would recover both principal and interest while unsecured creditors would receive only principal and interest accrued before ps of new hampshire filed for bankruptcy code protection in january 
 the biggest change in northeast 's offer was in improvements made for equity holders who had been given short <unk> previously 
 assuming full operation of the seabrook nuclear power plant which is completed but is n't yet operating equity holders would receive up to $ N million in cash preferred stock and new 10-year seabrook bonds 
 northeast 's previous offer had proposed that equity holders receive just $ N million 
 in addition northeast promised the state of new hampshire that rate increases would be limited to N N annually for seven years 
 its previous proposal had <unk> rate limits on seabrook operations and other <unk> 
 wilbur ross financial adviser to the equity holders said given the state 's strong bargaining position we believe the <unk> plan provides the best recovery available to ps of new hampshire 's equity holders 
 officials of ps of new hampshire could n't be reached for comment

 many a <unk> wo n't be born as a result and many a <unk> will never hang in a butcher shop 
 but with inflation <unk> grain in the <unk> will still be a safer bet for the private farmer than money in the bank 
 once again the <unk> peasant holds poland 's future in his hands 
 until his labor can produce a profit in this dying and distorted system even solidarity 's sympathetic new government wo n't win him over 
 in coming months emergency food aid moving in from the west will be the one buffer between a <unk> public and a new political <unk> 
 factory workers on strike knocked poland 's communist bosses off balance last year this year it was the farmers who brought them down 
 in june farmers held onto meat milk and grain waiting for july 's usual <unk> price rises 
 the communists <unk> prices instead 
 the farmers ran a <unk> and meat disappeared from the shops 
 on aug. N the state <unk> up its controls and food prices leaped 
 without buffer stocks inflation exploded 
 that was when the <unk> old peasants ' party desperate to live through the crisis broke ranks with the communists and joined with solidarity in the east bloc 's first <unk> government 
 but by the time solidarity took office in september the damage was done 
 <unk> as economists have come to call it had gone <unk> 
 the cost of raising a <unk> kept <unk> ahead of the return for selling one 
 the farmers stayed angry 
 they still are 
 at <unk> on a cool day hundreds travel to the private market in <unk> a town not far from warsaw <unk> pigs cattle and <unk> of feed that the state 's official buyers ca n't induce them to sell

 at closing time farmers <unk> out most of what they <unk> in 
 a private market like this just is n't big enough to absorb all that business 
 the <unk> of <unk> it seems will not quickly <unk> away

 polish agriculture will need a whole private network of procurement processing and distribution plus a new manufacturing industry to supply it with <unk> pesticides <unk> and feed 
 the communists spent N years working to ensure that no such <unk> structures ever arose here 
 building them now will require <unk> from the west and removal of political <unk> a job that solidarity has barely started

 i 've heard from friends that state farms are subsidized mr. <unk> says as his wife <unk> sets some chairs out in the sun 
 we have one near here 
 there is a lot of waste 
 a private farmer never <unk> anything 
 the state quit <unk> peasants onto its subsidized farms over N years ago 
 but it never did let up on the pressure 
 until recently a farmer with no heir had to will the state his land to collect his pension 
 the pension 's size still depends on how much produce he sells the state 
 his <unk> of materials also did until the state could n't hold up its end of that bargain 
 yet the state alone sells seeds and machines 
 when supplies are short it often hands them over only in exchange for milk or grain 
 a private farmer in poland is free to buy and sell land hire help decide what to grow and how to grow it 
 he is free to invest in <unk> and to fail for lack of chicken wire 
 he has plenty of freedom but no choices 
 i 'm on my own land mr. <unk> says 
 i do n't have to listen to what anybody tells me to do 
 sometimes says his wife we 're happy about that

 both the peasants and rural solidarity are forming new political parties for farmers 
 the peasants can make a credible case against solidarity that <unk> reform will drive millions from the land 
 next spring the two will battle in local elections 
 but until then and probably long afterward the communists ' <unk> of <unk> from the head of the dairy <unk> to the village bank manager will stay planted in the polish <unk>

 the house approved a short-term spending bill to keep the government operating through nov. N and provide $ N billion in emergency funds to assist in the recovery from hurricane hugo and the california earthquake 
 the N roll call vote reflected broad support for the disaster assistance but the cost to the treasury is sure to <unk> budget pressures this year and next under the gramm-rudman deficit reduction law 
 by a <unk> N margin the chamber rejected an effort to waive gramm-rudman for purposes of addressing the two disasters and budget analysts estimate the increased appropriations will widen the fiscal N deficit by at least $ N billion unless offsetting spending cuts or new revenues are found by congress 
 the budget impact will be greater still in fiscal N and the issue forced a confrontation between the appropriations committee leadership and budget committee chairman leon <unk> whose california district was at the center of the earthquake last week 
 going to the well of the chamber mr. <unk> demanded the costs be fully counted 
 his prominent role put him in the <unk> position of challenging the very committee members on whom his state will be most dependent in the months ahead 
 we do not come to this house asking for any <unk> said the california democrat 
 we do not intend to hide these costs from the american people 
 the $ N billion package <unk> $ N million for <unk> disaster loans $ N billion in highway construction funds and $ N billion divided between general emergency assistance and a reserve to be available to president bush to meet unanticipated costs from the two disasters 
 the funds are in addition to $ N billion appropriated last month to assist in the recovery from hugo bringing the total for the two disasters to nearly $ N billion in unanticipated spending 
 because of the <unk> of gramm-rudman the immediate impact is relatively small 
 but the appropriations set in motion spending that adds to an already grim budget picture for fiscal N 
 within the appropriations process the situation is even more difficult since the costs will be counted against the share of funds to be allocated to those <unk> that recently have had the greatest difficulty in staying within the budget 
 the underlying bill approved yesterday is required to keep the government operating past midnight tonight and this urgency has contributed to the speed and critics say mistakes that have accompanied the package of disaster assistance 
 the hastily drafted measure could hurt california by requiring it to put up more matching funds for emergency highway assistance than otherwise would be required 
 and the state 's delegation is fearful that the new funding will be counted against a separate $ N million in federal highway funds it would expect to receive under its normal allocation this year 
 also the high price of san francisco real estate puts the state at odds with federal regulations more <unk> to the national average 
 for example disaster loans which will go to small businesses and homeowners offer credit as low as N N in some cases 
 but the san francisco delegation finds itself asking that the cap per household be lifted to $ N from $ N to assist the hard hit but often wealthy marina district 
 the senate is expected to make some modifications today but both the white house and congress appear most anxious to speed final approval before tonight 's deadline 
 administration pressure <unk> any effort to add to total funding and the senate changes are expected to be largely technical dealing with highway aid and lifting the ceiling on total small business administration loans to $ N billion to accommodate the increased activity expected 
 yesterday 's floor action came as a house-senate conference approved a nearly $ N billion fiscal N military construction bill representing a N N reduction from last year and making severe cuts from pentagon requests for installations abroad 
 an estimated $ N million is allocated to continue work in <unk> 
 but all funding is cut for the philippines and projects in south korea are cut to $ N million or less than a sixth of the administration 's request 
 closer to home the negotiators were more generous 
 an estimated $ N million was set aside for military installations in the home state of north carolina rep. <unk> <unk> the house chairman 
 and $ N million would go to projects in tennessee represented by his senate counterpart and fellow democrat sen. james <unk> 
 texas and california are traditionally powerful within the conference but equally striking is the dominance of alaska pennsylvania and west virginia because of their power elsewhere in the appropriations process 
 senate appropriations committee chairman robert byrd d. <unk> even added report language listing $ N million in projects he wants in the budget next year 
 no individual illustrated this mix of power more yesterday than sen. daniel inouye d. hawaii who chairs the senate defense subcommittee 
 in the final trading the house was <unk> on setting aside $ N million to carry out base closings ordered to begin in fiscal N 
 but it gave ground to mr. inouye on a number of projects ranging from a $ N million parking garage here to a land transfer in hawaii to a provision to assist the <unk> indian tribe in washington state 
 the tribe is one of the poorest in the pacific northwest 
 mr. inouye who chairs the select committee on indian affairs used his power to move $ N from the air force to the bureau of indian affairs to assist in <unk> a <unk> base to accommodate a drug and alcohol rehabilitation center 
 meanwhile house-senate negotiators have tentatively agreed on a $ N billion anti-drug and <unk> <unk> cutting other federal spending N N to pay for it 
 a formal house-senate conference is expected to <unk> the accord later this week 
 mobil corp. is preparing to slash the size of its work force in the u.s. possibly as soon as next month say individuals familiar with the company 's strategy 
 the size of the cuts is n't known but they 'll be centered in the exploration and production division which is responsible for <unk> oil reserves drilling wells and pumping crude oil and natural gas 
 employees have n't yet been notified 
 sources said that meetings to discuss the staff reductions have been scheduled for friday at mobil offices in new orleans and denver 
 this would be a second round of cuts by mobil which along with other oil producers and refiners reduced its work force by N N to N N during the mid-1980s as part of an industrywide <unk> 
 mobil 's latest move could signal the beginning of further reductions by other oil companies in their domestic <unk> operations 
 in yesterday 's third-quarter earnings report the company <unk> to a $ N million provision for restructuring costs involving u.s. exploration and production operations 
 the report says that the restructuring will take place over a two-year period and will <unk> involve the transfer and termination of employees in our u.s. operations 
 a company spokesman reached at his home last night would only say that there will be a public announcement of the reduction program by the end of the week 
 most oil companies including mobil have been reporting lower third-quarter earnings largely as a result of lower earnings from chemicals as well as refining and marketing businesses 
 individuals familiar with mobil 's strategy say that mobil is reducing its u.s. work force because of declining u.s. output 
 yesterday mobil said domestic exploration and production operations had a $ N million loss in the third quarter while comparable foreign operations earned $ N million 
 industrywide oil production in this country fell by N barrels a day to N million barrels in the first eight months of this year 
 daily output is expected to decline by at least another N barrels next year 
 some mobil executives were <unk> that a reference to the cutbacks was included in the earnings report before workers were notified 
 one mobil executive said that the $ N million charge related to the action indicates a substantial number of people will be involved 
 some will likely be offered severance packages while others will be transferred to overseas operations 
 the justice department is in the process of trying to gain control over a law that federal judge david <unk> recently called a monster 
 <unk> to say he was talking about rico 
 with its recently revised guidelines for rico justice makes it clear that the law currently holds too many incentives for abuse by prosecutors 
 the text of the new policy guidelines from the criminal division are <unk> nearby 
 they strongly suggest that justice 's prosecutions of drexel burnham lambert michael <unk> and <unk> violated <unk> of fundamental fairness 
 justice is attempting to avoid a <unk> of these tactics 
 this amounts to an extraordinary <unk> of the tenure of new york mayoral candidate and former u.s. attorney rudolph giuliani who was more inclined to gathering <unk> than understanding markets 
 the new guidelines limit the pretrial <unk> of assets of <unk> defendants and their investors clients bankers and others 
 this follows earlier new guidelines from the tax division <unk> <unk> tax cases from <unk> as rico cases 
 the forfeiture memo cited considerable criticism in the press because of a perception that pre-trial <unk> of assets is <unk> to a seizure of property without due process 
 it told prosecutors not to seek <unk> if there are less <unk> alternatives such as bonds and in any case not to seek <unk> disproportionate to the defendant 's crime 
 these changes come a <unk> late for <unk> the first <unk> securities firm 
 it was forced into liquidation before trial when investors <unk> their funds after the government demanded a huge pre-trial asset forfeiture 
 <unk> investors including <unk> & co. and the harvard <unk> made the rational decision to withdraw their money for the firm the liquidation was sentence first verdict later 
 prosecutors wanted $ N million in forfeiture for alleged tax fraud of some $ N 
 the experience of <unk> and <unk> of other <unk> cases against legitimate businesses taught drexel that a <unk> investment bank would be an <unk> bank 
 drexel therefore agreed instead to an arrangement allowing it to plea to charges which the company is not in a position to dispute because of rico 
 part of drexel 's plea was to cut mr. <unk> loose 
 so after all the prosecutorial <unk> no one has established what if anything drexel did wrong 
 so two <unk> for the new rules 
 justice has finally recognized its employees ' abuses thanks largely to the demands for reform by former u.s. attorney in washington joseph <unk> who wants to salvage rico for real criminals 
 but prosecutorial guidelines are effective only if someone at justice is willing and able to <unk> <unk> prosecutors 
 judge <unk> of the appeals court in washington made this point at a <unk> institute conference last week in a remarkable speech titled rico the monster that <unk> <unk> 
 he said <unk> is supposed to be a government of laws not of men and yet rico defenders tell us that we should rely on prosecutorial discretion to protect against <unk> of rico 
 no prosecutorial guidelines observed or <unk> limit civil rico cases by plaintiffs for damages 
 what now for <unk> officials drexel and mr. <unk> 
 justice should review these cases to see what other prosecutorial abuses may have occurred 
 we suspect that justice will some day agree that only the complete repeal of rico can guarantee an end to <unk> in its name 
 the famous teddy z which cbs inc. had hoped would emerge as one of the few bright spots in its otherwise lackluster prime-time schedule is n't turning out to be the hit the network <unk> 
 although the half-hour situation comedy seen <unk> at N p.m eastern and pacific time is n't a candidate for cancellation it is slated for <unk> and by next week the network may announce teddy z is moving to N p.m. from its N time <unk> replacing the people next door which became the first network show to be canceled this season 
 teddy z which centers on a <unk> <unk> agent at a hollywood talent agency was scheduled in the <unk> N p.m. <unk> to follow murphy brown a situation comedy about a television news magazine <unk> <unk> <unk> 
 teddy z was boosted by favorable reviews and a <unk> promotional <unk> contest with k mart corp 
 it was <unk> on cable services including <unk> <unk> at night and <unk> and <unk> as the no. <unk> show for the week 
 but five weeks after the premiere the series has <unk> 
 in figures released yesterday by a.c. nielsen co teddy z produced by the television unit of columbia pictures entertainment inc. was in <unk> place 
 worse every week it <unk> audience <unk> from murphy brown and <unk> on cbs picks up again once teddy z is over and is followed by designing women 
 there is strong indication that teddy z is not compatible with the shows it is surrounding said john <unk> senior vice president at j. walter thompson co. a unit of wpp group plc 
 last week murphy brown was viewed by N N of the available television households while the number dropped to N N for teddy z and rose to N N for designing women 
 cbs executives said the program is also slated to <unk> some plot changes 
 <unk> <unk> wilson for example included the lead character 's <unk> family in the cast but that is not the right focus anymore said one cbs executive 
 instead cbs hopes the show will increasingly highlight the talent agency and the business of being an agent 
 we 're making adjustments on the show yes but nothing radical said craig nelson the story consultant on teddy z 
 but we hope to keep a balance between the office and the family 
 the opening credits are being <unk> mr. nelson said to make teddy 's situation clear to viewers who have not been with us since the beginning 
 those viewers find the show confusing 
 the stock market 's woes spooked currency traders but prompted a quiet little party among bond investors 
 prices of long-term treasury bonds moved <unk> to the stock market as investors sought safety amid growing evidence the economy is weakening 
 but the shaky economic outlook and the volatile stock market forced the dollar lower against major currencies 
 the bond market got an early boost from the <unk> sell-off in stocks 
 that rout was triggered by ual corp. 's announcement late monday that the proposed <unk> buy-out had collapsed 
 the <unk> decline in the dow jones industrial average during the morning trading session touched off a flight to safety that saw investors shifting assets from stocks to treasury bonds 
 at its strongest the treasury 's benchmark 30-year bond rose more than a point or more than $ N for each $ N face amount 
 as the stock market recovered some of its losses later in the day bond prices retreated 
 but analysts said the combination of a second consecutive decline in monthly <unk> orders and lackluster mid-october auto sales helped <unk> up the treasury market 
 a slowing economy and the implication of lower inflation and interest rates tend to bolster bond prices 
 on the surface the decline in september durable goods only N N did n't appear very weak 
 but orders for <unk> capital goods a <unk> of future plant and equipment spending were off N N after falling N N in august 
 auto makers reported that mid-october sales were running at an annual rate of about N million units far less than the N million units analysts had expected 
 taken together the <unk> and <unk> reports confirmed perceptions that the economy is <unk> down 
 although analysts do n't expect the federal reserve to ease credit policy soon reports like those yesterday help build the case for lower rates 
 now bond investors are looking toward next week 's report from national purchasing managers and the government 's october employment report as potentially prompting the fed to lower rates 
 the stock market 's <unk> drop frightened foreign investors who quickly bid the dollar lower 
 but as stock prices recovered some of the early losses so did the u.s. currency 
 although dealers said investors are becoming more bearish toward the dollar in the wake of the stock market 's recent troubles and as the u.s. economy <unk> the dollar ended down only modestly 
 in major market activity bond prices rose 
 the treasury 's benchmark 30-year bond gained nearly half a point or about $ N for each $ N face amount 
 the yield on the issue slipped to N N 
 the dollar retreated 
 in late new york trading the currency was quoted at N marks and N yen compared with N marks and N yen monday

 cast as violetta <unk> in a new production of <unk> 's la <unk> ms. <unk> last week did many things <unk> and others not so well 
 it is n't every day that we hear a violetta who can <unk> the first act 's <unk> music with all the little notes perfectly pitched and neatly <unk> together 
 never once did she <unk> for air or <unk> her <unk> 
 she was as cool as a <unk> 
 but as you may know things are not going well for violetta 
 there are times when she must show a little <unk> 
 she has <unk> after all and a <unk> <unk> and though a successful <unk> she is just about <unk> at the bank 
 worse her walls move all the time at least in this production 
 just when ms. <unk> sat down away from her guests to cough in private her salon began sliding around the stage her country <unk> also has a very active set of <unk> 
 hold on to those funny <unk> you wanted to caution her as the sets started to roll around once more 
 this is the most moving <unk> i 've ever seen 
 normally violetta can go about her business without wondering whether she is moving as <unk> as the <unk> 
 but this is a production designed and directed by franco <unk> and paid for by <unk> <unk> who has no need to count her pennies unlike violetta down to N louis at the opera 's end 
 seeing all those millions in action i was just so relieved that ms. <unk> <unk> thing that she is did n't <unk> <unk> herself in a <unk> 
 large and <unk> <unk> is another addition to the met 's growing stock of <unk> productions mostly by mr. <unk> 
 they have a life of their own and can be counted on to look good and perform whenever a cast is n't up to either 
 if a strike ever hits the met the company can still sell tickets to his <unk> and <unk> and boom out <unk> of another era 
 last week 's <unk> audience gave a bigger hand to a greenhouse than to the <unk> neil <unk> who sang an <unk> inside it 
 <unk> <unk> as a <unk> student <unk> around on <unk> mr. <unk> hardly seemed the fellow to catch a fancy <unk> 's eye 
 i wish he could wear <unk> in his voice 
 not nearly in his best form the <unk> made <unk> sounds along with his usual <unk> hand gestures 
 maybe mr. <unk> was too busy <unk> his set to work with his naturally <unk> <unk> 
 or is it that mr. <unk> is getting a little tired of <unk> 
 this is the same production already seen in paris and <unk> and its <unk> ideas echo the movie he made with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> 
 decades earlier maria <unk> sang the dallas staging that introduced the <unk> idea 
 in an <unk> that drives <unk> <unk> <unk> violetta lies dying in bed during the prelude rising <unk> when then she <unk> the great parties she used to throw 
 the entire opera is her dream 
 given the prelude 's <unk> connections with the music preceding the last act the idea is more <unk> than bad though as luck would have it for a change there actually was a <unk> in the pit whom we wanted to hear carlos <unk> trying to make <unk> music while we all waited for the bed <unk> to stir into song 
 once she did so the <unk> german <unk> with the shaky nerves who so often <unk> offered a <unk> flowing performance that in its <unk> and <unk> approach was totally at odds with the staging 
 of <unk> moments there were nearly none and whether this has to do with mr. <unk> or the wooden cast is hard to say 
 in any event ms. <unk> barely <unk> violetta 's <unk> in her long meeting with <unk> <unk> who as <unk> seemed fairly desperate trying to <unk> an <unk> <unk> into his heavy <unk> <unk> 
 di <unk> was n't much of an <unk> for <unk> southern france 
 perhaps mr. <unk> could let him substitute one of the <unk> about dead children and dark nights from <unk> 's <unk> 
 speaking of dark nights the met 's <unk> neighbor the new york city opera has canceled its season after failing to reach a settlement with its musicians who wanted pay parity with the the chicago <unk> and san francisco opera <unk> 
 well they can now go and <unk> there 
 good luck 
 common sense suggests that people who play for a company that charges about half what those houses do for a ticket are not in the same market 
 the cancellation <unk> poorly for a company already <unk> with an identity crisis <unk> by the retirement of general director beverly <unk> and the amazing appointment of christopher <unk> as her successor after his years of <unk> <unk> in the pit 
 as the met discovered years ago following a <unk> december opening it is nearly impossible to <unk> subscribers once they have had time to <unk> their entertainment choices 
 i for instance was perfectly happy at avery fisher hall the other day listening to <unk> <unk> conduct the <unk> per <unk> a strange piece written by N different italian <unk> to honor <unk> after his death in N 
 each of them contributed a section at the <unk> of <unk> who was nearly driven to his own early grave by the troublesome arrangements 
 for all that the piece landed <unk> in a dusty <unk> after bologna refused to supply a chorus and <unk> 
 we know <unk> 's own contribution was mighty impressive since the <unk> <unk> me was <unk> for the <unk> <unk> of which he wrote every note himself having learned his lesson 
 the surprising discovery of the evening at fisher was the high standard achieved by some of his <unk> colleagues notably <unk> <unk> 
 his <unk> <unk> was smoothly sung by bass brian matthews 
 also <unk> <unk> 's <unk> <unk> was <unk> scored and <unk> put across by mr. <unk> 
 he brought along his <unk> <unk> <unk> chorus and even better the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>

 those employees are suspected of illegally gaining an estimated $ N million the prosecutor was quoted as saying by the <unk> news service

 in what has become a series of <unk> announcements the world 's largest maker of <unk> said that after reviewing its order prospects we have concluded it is prudent to plan for next year on the assumption that revenue again will be flat 
 cray jolted the market in july when it slashed revenue and earnings projections for this year citing a slowing economy that has delayed orders from government as well as commercial customers 
 the company made its N projection an unusual event for cray in announcing improved net income for the third quarter 
 cray said it earned $ N million or $ N a share up N N from $ N million or N cents a share a year ago 
 revenue gained N N to $ N million from $ N million

 as for the current period mr. <unk> said we anticipate that fourth-quarter revenue and earnings will be substantially greater than any of the preceding three quarters but not up to the record levels of last year 's fourth quarter when cray earned $ N million or $ N a share 
 he added that the company expects strong operating profit for the year but at a level significantly lower than last year 
 he said N 's net income could be N N to N N of revenue which assuming current expectations would be N N to N N below N 's level

 the company cited softness in the retail health and beauty aids category as well as the intense competition in the company 's <unk> protection product line 
 overseas sales were stronger <unk> because of a rebound in brazil where economic turmoil had hurt year-earlier results johnson & johnson said 
 mr. <unk> of painewebber said the company 's sales pace has been picking up largely because the effect of unfavorable exchange rates has been easing a pattern continuing this quarter 
 he cautioned however that a tough <unk> comparison may slow the company 's earnings growth for the current quarter

 the stock in new york stock exchange composite trading yesterday closed at $ N up N cents well below the $ N to $ N a share the insiders received for their shares 
 much of the recent slide in dun & bradstreet 's stock came late last week after negative comments by analysts at merrill lynch & co. and goldman sachs & co 
 a company spokesman declined to comment and said that the officials who sold shares would n't comment 
 one of dun & bradstreet 's chief businesses is <unk> reports that rate the <unk> of millions of american companies

 the stock fell N cents 
 insider selling is not unusual at dun & bradstreet in fact the recent pace of selling is just about average for the company according to figures compiled by <unk> a north miami fla. firm that specializes in tracking and analyzing sec insider filings 
 but previous sales have often been sales of shares purchased through the exercise of stock options and sold six months later as soon as allowed said robert <unk> president of <unk>

 it 's a good company and growing there 's nothing that would warrant that it be sold 
 yesterday in composite trading on the american stock exchange <unk> closed at $ N up N cents 
 <unk> <unk> used to hold the <unk> belief that it was more perfect to exist than not to exist and that to exist as a matter of necessity was most perfect of all 
 now only god exists as a matter of <unk> necessity it is built into his nature 
 but since the time of <unk> we humans could at least claim a sort of natural necessity for the existence of our <unk> 
 are n't we after all the inevitable culmination of that <unk> <unk> called evolution 
 if <unk> and natural selection slowly but surely give rise to more and more advanced forms of life then it was only a matter of <unk> before <unk> beings <unk> with reason <unk> and taste <unk> onto the scene 
 now along comes stephen jay gould to <unk> this <unk> illusion 
 his credentials are excellent for the task 
 star <unk> at harvard author of numerous popular books on science and <unk> of the <unk> lobby mr. gould is perhaps the world 's most <unk> <unk> <unk> 
 yet he puts quite a twist on the old story handed down from <unk> 
 for him natural history is anything but a gradual predictable march from <unk> <unk> to human <unk> it is a <unk> chaotic affair in which the emergence of a <unk> <unk> was a <unk> shot 
 in wonderful life the burgess <unk> and the nature of history norton N pages $ N mr. gould makes his case for the <unk> <unk> of human evolution 
 the argument turns on the discovery in N of an amazing fossil <unk> high in the canadian <unk> called the burgess <unk> 
 here in an area smaller than a city block lay buried <unk> of <unk> weird creatures that had <unk> more than N million years ago creatures whose <unk> variety far exceeded what can be found in all the world 's <unk> today 
 such an embarrassment of <unk> was <unk> to the man who discovered the burgess <unk> one charles <unk> <unk> 
 the received <unk> wisdom of the day said that animals living so long ago must be simple in design limited in scope and <unk> to contemporary <unk> 
 <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> hypothetical <unk> from the burgess <unk> in such a way that they could be <unk> into familiar categories 
 it was not until the early 1970s that cambridge prof. harry whittington and two sharp graduate students began to publish a <unk> of the burgess <unk> 
 by making <unk> <unk> about how the <unk> and distorted fossil remains <unk> to <unk> structures this <unk> was able to piece together a series of <unk> <unk> quite unlike anything currently on the planet 
 one was so <unk> in appearance it was dubbed <unk> 
 would that mr. gould 's minute <unk> of these creatures was always so <unk> 
 a good deal of the book is boring particularly the endless <unk> to high and pop culture and the frequent jokes <unk> the text 
 these turns do not provide sufficient relief from sentences like most modern <unk> have six <unk> <unk> on the <unk> 
 interest picks up though when mr. gould gets around to discussing the meaning of the burgess <unk> for the theory of evolution 
 not long after the appearance of life <unk> there was an explosive proliferation in the number of animal designs seen on the earth 
 the vast majority of them however were wiped out by a succession of environmental <unk> that were too sudden and catastrophic for the normal rules of natural selection to operate 
 consequently the <unk> process was like a <unk> in which each group held a ticket unrelated to its <unk> <unk> 
 so much for survival of the <unk> 
 so much too for the notion that we humans <unk> in the <unk> struggle by <unk> big brains 
 our <unk> <unk> <unk> out through the <unk> impact that did in the <unk> because they were small not smart 
 if anyone has difficulty <unk> a world in which history went <unk> on without us mr. gould <unk> several 
 in one birds are the dominant <unk> in another the <unk> <unk> with little <unk> 
 back when the burgess <unk> were <unk> it seems human <unk> hopes hung on the survival of a little worm with a <unk> called <unk> 
 mr. gould finds this oddly <unk> like an <unk> of old he views our <unk> as a source of both freedom and <unk> moral responsibility 
 i by contrast can not help feeling that if some other <unk> from the burgess <unk> had survived instead beings at once <unk> and less <unk> than <unk> <unk> might have eventually gained <unk> dominion 
 but even if no <unk> life had <unk> here at all the universe is a big place and given the right conditions sympathetic to creating some form of life 
 surely at some other <unk> address a <unk> <unk> would have risen out of the <unk> to explain why <unk> speaking it is indeed a wonderful life 
 mr. holt is a columnist for the literary review in london 
 the justice department scrambled to play down the significance of its new guidelines concerning prosecutions under the federal racketeering law 
 the guidelines were distributed to u.s. attorneys last summer but were disclosed for the first time by press reports this week 
 they discourage prosecutors under certain circumstances from seeking court orders <unk> the assets of racketeering defendants prior to trial 
 but david runkel chief justice department spokesman said the guidelines are a <unk> and a <unk> far more than a new direction 
 use of the <unk> influenced and corrupt organizations law against white-collar defendants as opposed to alleged <unk> figures has come under attack from some defense lawyers and legal scholars 
 critics have complained that the law unfairly strips defendants of assets before a jury <unk> they have committed a crime and that aggressive use of the forfeiture provisions can <unk> corporate defendants or force them into unfavorable plea bargains 
 in the new guidelines the justice department says that in attempting to freeze disputed assets before trial the government will not seek to disrupt the normal legitimate business activities of the defendant and will not seek to take from third parties assets <unk> transferred to them 
 the guidelines also state the government 's policy is not to seek the <unk> forfeiture permissible under the law where that forfeiture would be disproportionate to the defendant 's crime 
 another provision <unk> certain limits on when prosecutors may use <unk> charges as a basis for bringing a racketeering case 
 mr. runkel declined to speculate on whether the guidelines would curb racketeering prosecutions against corporate defendants 
 the impact if there is any will be impossible to judge ahead of time because the decision whether to use racketeering charges is made in individual cases by justice department officials in washington he said 
 in a memorandum describing the guidelines assistant attorney general edward dennis jr. said that government efforts to freeze defendants ' assets pending racketeering prosecutions have been the subject of considerable criticism in the press 
 but mr. runkel said the government is n't backing off on these kinds of matters at all 
 california legislators searching for ways to pay for the $ N billion to $ N billion in damages from last week 's earthquake are laying the <unk> for a temporary increase in the state 's sales tax 
 the talk of a sales tax rise follows a <unk> from congress on the question of how much the federal government is willing to spend to aid in california 's earthquake relief efforts 
 the state had sought as much as $ N billion in relief but yesterday the house approved a more general <unk> measure calling for $ N billion in aid the bulk of which would go to california with an unspecified amount going to regions affected by hurricane hugo 
 that leaves the state roughly $ N billion to $ N billion short 
 a sales tax increase appears to be the fastest and <unk> to raise funds in a hurry 
 according to the state department of finance a <unk> increase in the state 's <unk> per dollar sales tax could raise $ N billion 
 <unk> brown speaker of california 's assembly said that gov. george deukmejian has agreed to schedule a special session of the legislature within two weeks 
 california 's so-called <unk> limit effectively prevents the state from spending new tax money and so drastically limits its options in an emergency 
 both mr. brown the state 's most influential legislator and gov. deukmejian favor a temporary sales tax increase should more money be needed than the state can raise from existing sources and the federal government 
 according to a spokesman the governor is also studying the possibility of raising state gasoline taxes 
 mr. brown meanwhile believes only one tax will be <unk> and it will be a <unk> sales tax increase said chuck <unk> an aide 
 one immediate source of money is an emergency fund set up by gov. deukmejian 
 the fund has about $ N billion and is set up to handle precisely the kind of emergency the state faces said tom <unk> the governor 's deputy press secretary 
 but the fund 's size is disputed by mr. brown 's office which estimates the fund holds from $ N million to $ N million 
 moreover an aide to mr. brown said gov. deukmejian has expressed a desire not to spend all the reserve on this 
 to push through a sales tax increase however the state will have to suspend the <unk> limit citing an emergency 
 and then it will be required to lower taxes by a corresponding amount during a three-year period after the temporary tax increase ends said <unk> katz assistant director of the state department of finance 
 a sales tax increase would require two-thirds approval in both houses of the state 's legislature 
 but observers expect broad support 
 if there 's an emergency and there are n't sufficient funds from elsewhere i think the attitude will be supportive said kirk west president of the california chamber of commerce 
 but others think property owners ought to pay a higher portion of the state 's earthquake relief <unk> 
 since the late 1970s california property owners have benefited from a tax <unk> as a result of a state ballot initiative known as proposition N 
 the state could also increase gasoline taxes every one penny increase in the tax would yield $ N million a month 
 but gov. deukmejian and others are reluctant to do anything to harm the state 's chances of sharply raising gasoline taxes on a permanent basis 
 to raise more highway funds a measure to double the state 's <unk> a <unk> tax over five years is set to appear on the state 's june election ballot 
 but some fear imposing a temporary gasoline tax increase in the meantime could undercut support among voters for the measure 
 not everyone is convinced the state must raise new revenue to meet its earthquake needs 
 it 's possible though not probable that the state could get by with its existing resources and federal help said <unk> <unk> chairman of the state senate 's transportation committee 
 separately two men injured in last week 's <unk> freeway collapse in oakland began a legal battle against the state over whether officials adequately <unk> warnings about the structure 's safety 
 the claims which were filed with the state board of control but will probably end up in court are the first arising out of the collapse of the so-called cypress structure <unk> 
 the men can defeat <unk> that states often <unk> in court by showing that officials knew or should have known that design of the structure was defective and that they failed to make reasonable changes 
 a board of control spokesman said the board had not seen the claim and declined to comment

 people start their own businesses for many reasons 
 but a chance to fill out <unk> records is rarely one of them 
 red tape is the <unk> of small business 
 ironically the person who wants to run his or her own business is probably the active <unk> sort most likely to hate meeting the rules and <unk> demands of federal state and local regulators 
 yet every business owner has to face the <unk> of forms and regulations and often is the only one available to tackle it 
 there is hope of change 
 last week sen. malcolm <unk> r. <unk> held hearings on a bill to strengthen an existing law designed to reduce regulatory <unk> for small businesses 
 a great many federal regulations are meant for larger entities and do n't really apply to small businesses says <unk> jacob a legislative aide to sen. <unk> 
 other lawmakers are busy trying to revive the recently <unk> <unk> reduction act which many feel benefited small enterprises 
 thus optimistic entrepreneurs await a promised land of less red tape just as soon as uncle sam gets around to arranging it 
 meanwhile they tackle the <unk> of paper and <unk> about a dream world where <unk> postal regulations and government inspectors are <unk> 
 to find out what red tape <unk> entrepreneurs most the journal asked a completely <unk> random sample of business owners to <unk> about the forms and regulations they would most like to get lost in the mail 
 some entrepreneurs say the red tape they most love to hate is red tape they would also hate to lose 
 they concede that much of the government <unk> that <unk> them is essential to the public good and even to their own businesses 
 rules that set standards for products or govern business behavior generally the best regarded form of red tape create a level playing field and keep unscrupulous competitors away says <unk> west president of <unk> international inc. a <unk> va. business that designs <unk> and other products 
 mr. west cites the federal communications commission and its standards for telecommunications equipment they monitor product quality and prevent junk from flooding the market 
 some <unk> about red tape are predictable architects complain about a host of building regulations auto leasing companies about car insurance rules 
 determining when handicapped access is required can be a nightmare for architects says mark <unk> president of <unk> & co. a <unk> mass. architectural firm 
 there is such a <unk> of federal state and local codes that building inspectors are backing away from <unk> them mr. <unk> says 
 taxi leasing and other companies that maintain fleets of vehicles devote substantial resources to <unk> with state insurance laws and a host of agencies 
 it 's very costly and <unk> says phil rosen a partner in fleet & leasing management inc. a boston <unk> company 
 one senior executive at his firm spends nearly N N of his time on insurance he says 
 other forms of red tape are more pervasive 
 the most onerous many entrepreneurs say is the <unk> and filing required by tax authorities 
 <unk> with environmental and workplace regulations runs a close second 
 but <unk> run the <unk> 
 here is the red tape that <unk> surveyed business owners the most 
 environmental regulations 
 next to medical insurance costs of compliance are the fastest-growing expense at <unk> inc. a <unk> r.i. chemical company 
 peter <unk> the company 's owner says spending on regulatory paper work and the people to do it mostly to comply with federal state and local environmental laws will rise almost N N this year to $ N 
 mr. <unk> adds that spending on environmental red tape amounts to between N N and N N of <unk> 's total operating expenses 
 eastern <unk> corp. a <unk> mass. maker of thin metal precision parts must report to five federal and state agencies as well as to local fire police hospital and plumbing authorities says robert <unk> president 
 one state environmental regulator returned a report because it was n't heavy enough it could n't have been correct mr. <unk> says 
 <unk> rules 
 employers must deposit <unk> taxes exceeding $ N within three days after payroll or pay stiff penalties and that 's a big problem for small businesses 
 it 's especially <unk> if you 're on the road and you 're the one responsible says eddie brown president of brown capital management inc. a baltimore <unk> firm 
 employee <unk> 
 <unk> employee <unk> on <unk> health care and other subjects costs over $ N a year for <unk> <unk> president of professional agricultural management inc. a <unk> calif. provider of business services to farmers 
 an employer leaves itself open to a great deal of liability if its employee <unk> do n't reflect the most recent laws he says 
 but the <unk> laws are usually so complicated and confusing that you need professionals to help you you ca n't do it yourself he adds 
 pension and <unk> rules 
 <unk> with these is enough to make business owners look forward to their own pension days 
 yearly changes in federal benefit laws force small businesses to repeatedly <unk> and <unk> existing plans 
 alice <unk> who runs her own public-relations concern in new york says she has had to overhaul her pension and <unk> plans three times in the past three years 
 it does n't increase benefits but it 's costly and <unk> ms. <unk> says 
 compliance added N N to N N to her accounting bill last year she says 
 sales tax records 
 advertising agencies and other service companies are exempt from city and state sales tax in most <unk> but the exemption comes at a price of <unk> records and <unk> reviews 
 to justify their exempt status and avoid penalties these businesses must show once a year that each and every transaction on which they did n't pay sales tax was a legitimate business expense 
 you need one person to just take care of sales tax says <unk> <unk> executive vice president of lee <unk> & <unk> advertising inc. new york 
 when the trinity <unk> theater named anne bogart its artistic director last spring the nation 's theatrical <unk> <unk> a collective <unk> 
 ms. bogart an <unk> <unk> of <unk> dramatic <unk> that <unk> into such <unk> <unk> as <unk> and <unk> 's south pacific is <unk> downtown 
 trinity rep meanwhile is one of the nation 's oldest and most respected regional theaters still <unk> an annual a christmas carol 
 how would this <unk> of traditional values fare in ms. bogart 's <unk> hands 
 she held her fire with her first production at the trinity earlier this season 
 it was a predictable revival of her <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> 's theoretical <unk> called no plays no <unk> 
 now with the opening of <unk> gorky 's <unk> <unk> ms. bogart has laid her cards on the table 
 <unk> is a hand that will test the <unk> of her audiences 
 for ms. bogart who initially studied and directed in germany and cites such european directors as peter stein giorgio <unk> and <unk> <unk> as influences tends to stage her productions with a <unk> <unk> whether the text demands it or not 
 and gorky considered the father of soviet socialist <unk> did not write plays that easily lend themselves to deliberately <unk> <unk> techniques 
 gorky was a loyal if occasionally <unk> <unk> writer committed to <unk> the <unk> with plain speaking rooted in a slightly sour version of <unk> <unk> 
 and <unk> <unk> in N as a kind of <unk> to <unk> 's cherry <unk> is a lawn party of russian <unk> engaged in an <unk> ideological fight to the finish between the <unk> and the reformers 
 along the way there also are lots of romantic <unk> 
 <unk> ms. bogart has kept gorky 's time and place intact 
 despite the absence of <unk> and a tendency to turn the furniture upside down the production is rich in russian <unk> voiced by <unk> folk sporting <unk> <unk> and <unk> cotton with <unk> and fishing poles <unk> 
 but beyond this <unk> <unk> to tradition ms. bogart and company head off in a <unk> direction that all but <unk> gorky 's <unk> drama into something <unk> to well <unk> 
 the director 's attempt to force some <unk> distance between her actors and their characters frequently <unk> with performances that are <unk> <unk> 
 not only do the actors stand outside their characters and make it clear they are at odds with them but they often literally stand on their heads 
 like peter <unk> ms. bogart <unk> her actors as if they were <unk> <unk> <unk> them on <unk> <unk> them off tables even hanging them from <unk> while having them perform some <unk> <unk> of <unk> 
 there are moments in this <unk> when the characters <unk> the vast <unk> country house which looks like a <unk> of frank lloyd wright and is designed by <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with the <unk> <unk> <unk> of <unk> in 
 talk <unk> from where it <unk> one of them says 
 the clash of <unk> <unk> this treatment but the <unk> and <unk> of gorky 's individual characters have <unk> in the <unk> 
 as for the humor that gorky 's text provides when <unk> in such broad strokes particularly by the lesser members of the <unk> it looks and sounds forced 
 ms. bogart does better with music than with words when she wants as she so often does want to express herself through gorky 's <unk> play 
 here she has the aid of her longtime associate jeff <unk> whom she appointed trinity 's <unk> musical director and whom she equipped with a <unk> new $ N sound system and recording studio 
 for gorky mr. <unk> provided an <unk> <unk> of <unk> and <unk> which is less a score than a separate character with a distinct point of view 
 like <unk> and indeed <unk> pound ms. bogart has said that her intent in such <unk> staging of the <unk> is simply an attempt to make it new 
 indeed during a recent <unk> audience discussion the director explained that her <unk> artistic wish was to find a way to play somewhere over the rainbow so that the song 's original beauty comes through <unk> the <unk>

 homefed corp. said third-quarter net income slid N N to $ N million or $ N per fully diluted share from $ N million or $ N a fully diluted share because of increased bad assets and unexpected trouble in unloading foreclosed property 
 the decline surprised analysts and jolted homefed 's stock which lost N N of its value closing at $ N on the new york stock exchange down $ N 
 homefed had been one of the handful of large west coast thrifts that in recent quarters had <unk> interest-rate problems <unk> the industry by keeping a lid on problem assets and lending heavily into the <unk> california housing market 
 analysts had been projecting fully diluted earnings in the third quarter in the range of about $ N a share 
 however homefed 's loan <unk> and purchases plunged N N in the quarter to $ N billion from $ N billion a year earlier 
 meanwhile <unk> assets rose to $ N million from $ N million 
 some $ N million of the troubled assets is <unk> real estate a N N surge from the $ N million of <unk> property homefed held a year ago 
 homefed has $ N billion of assets 
 homefed said most of the troubled assets are apartment <unk> shopping <unk> and other commercial real estate 
 it said about half are in california with the rest scattered across the country 
 it said sales of such properties were slower than anticipated in the third quarter but it expects sales to pick up in the rest of the year 
 homefed said the slide in loan <unk> was more a matter of design than a sign of cooling in the california market 
 any such downturn in california would be grim news for west coast thrifts particularly the less healthy ones which have performed poorly even with a <unk> market 
 but homefed said it <unk> <unk> loan <unk> in the quarter because of uncertainty over the new capital requirements and regulations that will emerge from negotiations over <unk> the government 's massive thrift bailout bill

 yields on certificates of deposit at major banks were little changed in the latest week 
 the average yield on six-month cds of $ N and less slipped to N N from N N according to banxquote money markets an information service based here 
 on one-year cds of $ N and less the average slid to N N from N N 
 both issues are among the most popular with individual investors 
 because of <unk> in the economy rates can be expected to decline over a one-year horizon said <unk> mehl chairman of banxquote 
 it 's unclear how much rates can fall and how soon 
 changes in cd yields in the week ended tuesday were in line with <unk> up and down within a fairly narrow range for the last two months 
 interest rates generally began declining last spring after moving steadily upward for more than a year 
 the average yield on <unk> three-month cds moved up <unk> of a percentage point in the latest week to N N 
 long-term cds declined just a fraction 
 the average yield on both two-year cds and five-year cds was N N

 the average yield on six-month <unk> cds rose to N N from N N and on one-year cds the average yield rose to N N from N N

 some <unk> posted <unk> changes in average yields this week both up and down 
 the average yield on <unk> <unk> rose to N N from N N while the two-year average fell by the same amount to N N 
 six-month and <unk> yields were unchanged on average 
 the cd market is unsettled right now said banxquote 's mr. mehl 
 it 's very easily influenced by changes in the stock market and the junk bond market 
 the small changes in averages reflect generally unchanged yields at many major banks 
 some however lowered yields significantly 
 at chase manhattan bank in new york for example the yield on a small <unk> six-month cd fell about a quarter of a percentage point to N N 
 in california bank of america dropped the yield on both six-month and one-year savings cds to N N from N N

 benjamin jacobson & sons has been the new york stock exchange specialist firm in charge of trading stock in ual corp. and its <unk> since the early 1930s 
 but the firm has never had a day like yesterday 
 at first ual did n't open because of an order <unk> 
 when it did a half-hour into the session it was priced at $ N a share down more than $ N from monday 's close 
 it sank further to as low as $ N but a big rally developed in the last half hour pushing the stock back up to close at $ N down just $ N from monday 
 in the process N million shares traded making ual the second most active issue on the big board 
 <unk> pizza when they could and <unk> until their voices gave out the two benjamin jacobson specialists at the big board 's ual trading post yesterday <unk> over what can only be described as a financial <unk> 
 it was chaotic 
 but we like to call it controlled chaos said <unk> robert j. jacobson jr. <unk> of the firm 's founder 
 he <unk> the ual post yesterday with christopher bates N an energetic long <unk> who 's a dead ringer for actor <unk> <unk> 
 who was doing all the selling 
 options traders arbitrage traders everyone said mr. bates cooling down with a <unk> of apple <unk> after the close yesterday 
 added mr. jacobson there were some pretty bad losses in the stock 
 big board traders said a <unk> buy order at $ N a share entered by bear stearns & co. which was active in ual stock all day is what set off the ual crowd in the late afternoon 
 a subsequent rally in ual helped the staggering stock market stage an <unk> recovery from an <unk> deficit to finish only slightly below monday 's close 
 both jacobson traders who had been hoping ual trading would get back to normal read the news about the <unk> of ual takeover plans on the train into work yesterday morning 
 the news told them it would be a while longer before ual resumed trading like a regular airline stock after months of gyrations 
 when mr. jacobson walked into the office at N a.m. edt he announced ok buckle up 
 messrs. jacobson and bates walked on the big board floor at about N a.m. yesterday and immediately spotted trouble 
 already entered in the big board 's computers and <unk> to their post were sell orders for N ual shares 
 the ual news had already caused a selling furor in the so-called third market in which firms buy and sell stock away from the exchange floor 
 ual which closed on the big board monday at $ N a share traded in the third market afterward as low as $ N a share 
 there were rumors of $ <unk> trades 
 in the N minutes before the N opening bell the jacobson specialists kept getting sell orders heavier than they <unk> 
 and at N they posted a $ N to $ N first indication or the price range in which the stock would probably open 
 that range was quickly narrowed to $ N to $ N although traders surrounding the post were told that $ N to $ N would be the likely target 
 when ual finally opened a half hour late some N shares traded at $ N 
 there was selling pressure from everyone said one trader 
 this month 's friday-the-13th market plunge spurred by ual news was n't as bad for the jacobson specialists as yesterday 's action 
 on that earlier day the stock 's trading was halted at a critical time so the specialists could catch their breath 
 not yesterday 
 mr. jacobson his gray hair flying did n't wear out his <unk> <unk> but he sweat so much he considered sending out for a new <unk> 
 mr. bates usually handles day-to-day ual trading on his own 
 but yesterday the heavy trading action eventually consumed not only messrs. jacobson and bates but four other jacobson partners all doing their <unk> job of <unk> buyers and sellers together and adjusting prices to accommodate the market 
 about N floor traders <unk> near the ual post most of the day and probably hundreds more came and went a <unk> mass as one trader described it 
 the N <unk> volume flowing through the jacobson specialist operation was about five times normal for the stock 
 the heavy buying in the last half hour led the specialists to take special steps 
 the bear stearns order that marked the <unk> turnaround caused a massive buying effort as ual jumped $ N a share to $ N in the last half hour said mr. bates 
 with N seconds of trading to go mr. jacobson with what voice he had left announced to the trading <unk> we 're going to trade one price on the bell 
 that meant no trading would occur in the final seconds as a way of making sure that <unk> orders are n't <unk> to a sudden price swing that would upset customers 
 about N shares sold at $ N on the bell representing about eight to N late orders the specialists estimate 
 big board traders praised the jacobson specialists for getting through yesterday without a trading halt 
 in chicago a ual spokesman by way of policy declined to comment on the company 's stock or the specialists ' performance 
 leaving the exchange at about N p.m. the jacobson specialists made no predictions about how trading might go today 
 said <unk> ellis a jacobson partner who got involved in the ual action it all starts all over again today 
 britain 's current account deficit dropped to # N billion $ N billion in september from an adjusted # billion $ N billion the previous month but the improvement comes amid increasing concern that a recession could strike the u.k. economy next year 
 the confederation of british industry 's latest survey shows that business executives expect a <unk> slowdown largely because of a <unk> series of interest-rate increases that has raised banks ' base lending rates to N N 
 the outlook has deteriorated since the summer with orders and employment falling and output at a standstill said david <unk> chairman of the industry group 's economic committee 
 he also said investment by businesses is falling off 
 of N companies surveyed N N expect to cut spending on plant equipment and machinery while only N N plan to spend more 
 but despite mounting recession fears government data do n't yet show the economy <unk> to a halt 
 unemployment for example has continued to decline and the september trade figures showed increases in both imports and exports 
 as a result prime minister margaret thatcher 's government is n't currently expected to ease interest rates before next spring if then 
 chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson views the high rates as his chief weapon against inflation which was <unk> by tax cuts and loose credit policies in N and N 
 officials fear that any <unk> this year could <unk> inflation or further weaken the pound against other major currencies 
 <unk> off attacks on his economic policies in a house of commons debate yesterday mr. lawson said inflation remains the greatest threat to our economic <unk> and promised to take whatever steps are needed to <unk> it off 
 the latest government figures said retail prices in september were up N N from a year earlier 
 many economists have started predicting a mild recession next year 
 david owen u.k. economist with kleinwort benson group reduced his growth forecast for N to N N from N N and termed the risk of recession next year quite high 
 but he said the downturn probably wo n't become a major <unk> similar to those of N and N 
 still britain 's current slump is a cause for concern here as the nation joins in the european community 's plan to create a unified market by N 
 compared with the major economies on the continent the u.k. faces both higher inflation and lower growth in the next several months 
 as a result mr. owen warned investment will be more likely to flow toward the other european economies and the u.k. will be less prepared for the single market 
 britain 's latest trade figures contained some positive news for the economy such as a surge in the volume of exports which were N N higher than a year earlier 
 but while september exports rose to # N billion imports shot up to # N billion 
 the resulting # N billion merchandise trade deficit was partly offset by an assumed surplus of # N million in so-called <unk> items which include income from investments services and official transfers 
 despite the narrowing of the monthly trade gap economists expect the current account deficit for all of N to swell to about # N billion from # N billion in N 
 increasingly economists say the big deficit reflects the slipping competitive position of british industry 
 when the country gets <unk> we tend to buy high-quality imports mr. owen said 
 vickers plc a british aerospace defense and automotive conglomerate said it reached an agreed cash bid of # N million $ N million for ross <unk> group plc a maker of specialty <unk> and <unk>

 vickers said its offer also includes an option to receive a <unk> loan note in <unk> of cash 
 the notes can be redeemed starting in july N

 a group of investors recently bought the remaining assets of <unk> hoping to rebuild it 
 other investors have lost millions in partnerships that bought thoroughbred <unk> or <unk> breeding rights 
 one big problem has been the thoroughbred <unk> market 
 from N to N prices for the best <unk> at the summer sales rose N N to an average of $ N

 you can see the highs and lows of the business all under one <unk> she tells the group 
 there are n't too many winners 
 perhaps the biggest hurdle owners face is convincing newcomers that this is a reputable business 
 some badly managed partnerships have burned investors sometimes after they received advice from industry consultants 
 so owners have developed a code of ethics <unk> rules for consultants and agents and disclosure of fees and any conflicts of interest 
 but some are skeptical of the code 's effectiveness 
 the industry is based on individual honesty says cap <unk> a lexington horse farmer and one of the investors who bought <unk> 
 despite the drop in prices for <unk> owning one still is n't cheap 
 at the low end investors can spend $ N or more to own a <unk> in partnership with others 
 at a <unk> sale a buyer can go solo and get a horse for a few thousand dollars 
 but that means paying the horse 's maintenance on average it costs $ N a year to raise a horse

 general electric co. executives and lawyers provided misleading and false information to the pentagon in N in an effort to cover up longstanding fraudulent billing practices federal prosecutors alleged in legal briefs 
 the government 's startling allegations filed only days before the scheduled start of a criminal <unk> trial against ge in philadelphia federal district court challenge the <unk> and <unk> of the nation 's third-largest defense contractor 
 in a strongly <unk> response <unk> a filing made in the same court yesterday ge asserted that prosecutors have misstated the testimony of witnesses distorted documents and ignored important facts 
 the company attacked the government 's allegations as reckless and <unk> <unk> and said its management promptly and accurately reported to the pentagon all relevant information about billing practices 
 the case strikes at the corporate image of ge which provides the military with everything from jet engines and electronic <unk> equipment to highly classified design work on the strategic defense initiative and could cause a loss of future defense contracts if pentagon and justice department officials take a tough stance 
 the company has been considered an industry leader in <unk> cooperation and voluntary disclosures of improper or inflated billing practices 
 but the government now claims that a group of company managers and lawyers engaged in an elaborate strategy over five years to <unk> from federal authorities the extent and details of widespread fraudulent billing practices 
 the problems were uncovered during a series of internal investigations of the company 's space systems division which has been the focus of two separate <unk> prosecutions by the government since N 
 the dispute stems from pretrial <unk> in the pending court case in which prosecutors have been demanding access to a host of internal company <unk> reports and documents 
 last november a federal grand jury indicted ge on charges of fraud and false claims in connection with an alleged scheme to <unk> the army of $ N million on a <unk> computer contract 
 the company for its part maintains that many of the disputed documents are <unk> <unk> communications that should n't be turned over to prosecutors 
 a hearing is scheduled on the issue today 
 the government 's <unk> filing covers events leading up to the current case and an earlier indictment in march N when ge was accused of <unk> the pentagon by illegally claiming cost overruns on <unk> missile contracts 
 ge pleaded guilty and paid a fine of more than $ N million in the <unk> case which involved some of the same individuals and operations that are at the center of the dispute in the philadelphia court 
 in order to show that all of its units had corrected billing problems and therefore should become eligible again for new contracts prosecutors contend that <unk> ge executives and company lawyers provided misleading statements to <unk> force secretary <unk> <unk> and other pentagon officials during a series of meetings in N

 ge which was surprised by the last-minute subpoena for more than N boxes and file <unk> of documents <unk> that senior ge managers did n't find out about questionable billing practices until N and that the information was passed on quickly to mr. <unk> at his first meeting with company representatives 
 subsequent meetings initiated after the company and two of its units were briefly suspended from federal contracts were held to <unk> mr. <unk> with the company 's <unk> procedures and to disclose additional information according to ge 
 ge 's filing contends that the billing practices at the heart of the current controversy involved technical disputes rather than criminal activity 
 the company 's conduct does not even raise a question of <unk> corporate intent <unk> or <unk> ge 's brief asserts 
 on the contrary it shows a corporation reacting swiftly and aggressively to very difficult issues in largely <unk> waters

 savings and loans reject blacks for mortgage loans twice as often as they reject whites the office of thrift supervision said 
 but that does n't necessarily mean thrifts are <unk> against blacks the agency said 
 the office an arm of the treasury said it does n't have data on the financial position of applicants and thus ca n't determine why blacks are rejected more often 
 nevertheless on capitol hill where the information was released yesterday at a senate banking subcommittee hearing lawmakers said they are worried that financial institutions are routinely <unk> against minorities 
 they asked regulators to suggest new ways to force banks and thrifts to comply with <unk> laws 
 sen. alan <unk> d ill. chairman of the subcommittee on consumer and regulatory affairs said i 'm not a <unk> 
 but when blacks are getting their loan applications rejected twice as often as whites and in some cities it is three and four times as often i conclude that discrimination is part of the problem 
 james <unk> a spokesman for the u.s. league of savings institutions said the data is a red flag but lacking the financial data you ca n't make a case that discrimination is widespread 
 the trade group official added certainly the federal government should take a hard look at it 
 sen. <unk> held the hearing to follow up on a provision in the savings and loan bailout bill that required regulators to report on evidence of <unk> in mortgage lending 
 the legislation also requires broad new disclosures of the race sex and income level of borrowers but that information wo n't be gathered in new studies for several months at least 
 the federal reserve said its studies in recent years which adjust for income differences and other <unk> showed that blacks received fewer home mortgages from banks and thrifts than whites 
 but john <unk> a fed governor told the subcommittee the evidence is mixed and that the fed 's believes the vast majority of banks are n't <unk> 
 for instance he noted the fed studies have shown that blacks receive more home improvement loans than whites 
 several lawmakers were angered that the bank and thrift regulators generally said they have been too busy handling the record number of bank and thrift failures in the past few years to put much energy into investigating possible discrimination 
 we would be the first to admit that we have not devoted the necessary amount of emphasis over the past several years to developing <unk> for discrimination said jonathan <unk> a top official of the office of thrift supervision 
 if we 've got folks out there who are being turned away in the mortgage market improperly and unfairly said sen. donald <unk> d. mich. chairman of the banking committee then that is a matter that needs remedy now not six months from now or six years from now or N years from now

 the agency investigated the complaints but no violations were cited 
 thrift regulators did n't give any figures on their enforcement actions 
 mr. <unk> said that among the possibilities being considered by regulators to fight discrimination is the use of <unk> government investigators who would pose as home buyers

 time warner inc. is considering a legal challenge to tele-communications inc. 's plan to buy half of showtime networks inc. a move that could lead to <unk> war between the cable industry 's two most powerful players 
 time is also fighting the transaction on other fronts by attempting to discourage other cable operators from joining tele-communications as investors in showtime cable-tv industry executives say 
 time officials declined to comment 
 last week tele-communications agreed to pay viacom inc. $ N million for a N N stake in its showtime subsidiary which is a distant second to time 's home box office in the delivery of <unk> networks to cable subscribers 
 tele-communications the u.s. 's largest cable company said it may seek other cable partners to join in its investment 
 tele-communications is hbo 's largest customer and the two have a number of other business relationships 
 earlier this year time even discussed bringing tele-communications in as an investor in hbo executives at both companies said 
 the purchase of the showtime stake is a direct <unk> in our face said one senior time executive 
 time is expected to mount a legal challenge in u.s. district court in new york where viacom in may filed a $ N billion antitrust suit charging time and hbo with <unk> the <unk> business and trying to crush competition from showtime 
 executives involved in <unk> time 's defense say it is now preparing a <unk> naming both viacom and tele-communications as defendants 
 the executives say time may seek to break up the transaction after it is <unk> or may seek constraints that would prevent tele-communications from dropping hbo in any of its cable systems in favor of showtime 
 viacom officials declined to comment 
 jerome <unk> tele-communications ' chief outside counsel said he was n't aware of time 's legal plans 
 but he said that any effort by time to <unk> the tele-communications investment in showtime as <unk> would be the pot calling the <unk> black 
 it 's hard to see how an investment by the largest cable operator in the weaker of the two networks is <unk> when the stronger of the two networks is owned by the second largest cable operator mr. <unk> said 
 in addition to owning hbo with N million subscribers time warner separately operates cable-tv system serving about N million cable-tv subscribers 
 tele-communications controls close to N million cable subscribers and viacom has about one million 
 in its suit against time viacom says the ownership of both cable systems and <unk> networks gives the company too much market power 
 time argues that in joining up with tele-communications viacom has potentially more power particularly since viacom also owns cable networks <unk> <unk> and <unk> at <unk> 
 ironically tele-communications and time have often worked closely in the cable business 
 together they control nearly N N of turner broadcasting systems inc. tele-communications has a N N stake while time warner has a N N stake 
 but since time 's merger with warner communications inc. relations between the two have become <unk> 
 each company worries that the other is becoming too powerful and too <unk> integrated 
 meanwhile some legal observers say the tele-communications investment and other developments are weakening viacom 's antitrust suit against time 
 viacom <unk> time in its suit of refusing to carry showtime or a sister service the movie channel on time 's manhattan cable tv system one of the nation 's largest urban systems 
 but yesterday manhattan cable announced it will launch showtime on nov. N to over N subscribers

 but showtime has continued to sign new contracts with hollywood studios and yesterday announced it will buy movies from columbia pictures entertainment inc. which currently has a <unk> arrangement with hbo 
 the federal trade commission said it authorized its staff to seek a preliminary injunction barring imo industries inc. from acquiring the shares outstanding of the u.s. unit of the british company united scientific holdings plc for $ N million

 the ftc said it would seek to <unk> the proposed acquisition in a federal trial court but declined to specify which one 
 under federal law if the court grants a preliminary injunction the ftc must begin administrative proceedings to determine the <unk> of the proposed stock purchase within N days

 the airline industry 's fortunes in <unk> shape for most of the year have taken a sudden turn for the worse in the past few weeks 
 citing rising fuel costs promotional fare cuts and a general slowdown in travel several major carriers have posted or are expected to post relatively poor third-quarter results 
 yesterday usair group inc. recently one of the industry 's <unk> performers posted a <unk> $ N million net loss for the period 
 so far the industry 's fourth quarter is n't looking too strong either prompting many analysts to slash earning projections for the rest of the year by as much as <unk> 
 and they say the outlook for N is nearly as bad 
 airlines in N came in like a bang and are going out like a <unk> said kevin murphy an airline analyst at morgan stanley & co 
 this turn of events has put a big <unk> on an industry that seemed almost <unk> last spring when fares were rising at double-digit rates and many carriers seemed to be growing fat on <unk> in certain markets 
 now many airline companies might become a lot less attractive as takeover targets on wall street 
 the downturn also raises questions about the carriers ' ambitious orders for new airplanes which currently total $ N billion over the next three years 
 for travelers though the industry 's problems have had some positive effects 
 in recent weeks airlines have cut numerous fares in leisure markets to try to win back customers 
 others have tried to <unk> up <unk> programs 
 previously airlines were limiting the programs because they were becoming too expensive 
 just last week for example trans world airlines and pan am corp. 's pan american world airways went so far as to offer cash rebates or gift checks of $ N to $ N to certain <unk> members making <unk> flights in business class or first class 
 the industry 's slowdown became apparent this month when amr corp. parent of american airlines reported an N N drop in third-quarter net income and said its fourth quarter would be disappointing 
 shortly before that usair had said its third-quarter results would be significantly lower than a year earlier 
 yesterday it provided the details 
 its loss of $ N million or $ N a share <unk> with net of $ N million or $ N a share in the N third quarter 
 revenue rose only N N in the latest period to $ N billion from $ N billion 
 for the nine months the <unk> va. company 's net plunged N N to $ N million or N cents a share from $ N million or $ N a share 
 revenue rose N N to $ N billion from $ N billion 
 the results surprised many analysts because usair has almost no competition in its pittsburgh hub and has expanded operations by completing its acquisition of <unk> airlines 
 shortly after announcing its quarterly loss usair 's stock tumbled $ N a share 
 it ended at $ N down $ N in new york stock exchange composite trading 
 nobody was expecting this size of a loss said paul <unk> an analyst with first boston corp 
 one airline executive who declined to be identified called the loss amazing 
 in announcing the results usair cited many of the same problems that several other industry officials have named recently 
 it said the industry 's domestic traffic was flat in the third quarter analysts say this was because hefty fare increases earlier in the year scared off many leisure travelers this summer 
 to try to combat the traffic slowdown airlines started reducing fares average fares rose only N N in august in contrast to increases of N N each in february and march 
 but so far the effort has failed and traffic is still slow 
 some other fare promotions have <unk> 
 this summer the industry introduced a kids fly free program in which children were allowed to fly free if they were traveling with an adult 
 airlines tried to restrict the program substantially by limiting the offer to certain days of the week but it still was apparently used far more heavily than the airlines expected 
 airlines also say their <unk> programs are <unk> profits because <unk> are being redeemed at a <unk> rate 
 one airline official said about three times as many <unk> coupons are being turned in as in previous years not surprisingly as the airlines last year allowed many travelers to build up <unk> at triple the normal rate 
 rising operating expenses are another problem 
 fuel costs were up N N in the third quarter 
 labor costs which <unk> off in the past few years because of lower pay <unk> for newer employees are on the <unk> again at many carriers 
 and some carriers are facing other unexpected headaches usair for example blamed some of its loss on merger expenses and on disruptions caused by hurricane hugo last month 
 we can not <unk> the total adverse effects of hugo said edwin <unk> chairman and president of usair group 
 whatever the cause for the downturn few people are predicting any sudden improvement 
 airline economics inc. an aviation consulting firm is projecting an industrywide operating profit of $ N billion for N compared with earlier forecasts of $ N billion to $ N billion 
 as for N the firm predicts that profit will slip to between $ N billion and $ N billion

 the <unk> schedule of <unk> will be kicked off officially with a combination live and <unk> <unk> special at the <unk> bowl in january 
 all the <unk> though have some marketing experts questioning whether the party may go too far 
 there are too many people participating says al <unk> of <unk> & <unk> a greenwich conn. marketing consulting firm 
 if you want to cut through the clutter you have to make your message as distinct sharp and individual as possible 
 sharing a character with other advertisers is n't a way to do that 
 but united media says it 's very <unk> with the contracts it hands out 
 we 're not interested in promoting every single product that comes along mr. shore says 
 metropolitan life ad executives could n't be reached about the use of the peanuts characters by others 
 but mr. shore says that company 's exclusive advertising rights extend only to the insurance and financial services category

 the <unk> <unk> for takeover-stock traders who by then had seen ual stock tumble N N since oct. N also triggered a <unk> sell-off that sent the dow jones industrial average down more than N points at N a.m 
 but then steady concentrated buying by bear stearns & co. which frequently buys stock for corporate raiders took hold and <unk> the fall in ual which eventually buoyed the entire market 
 the industrial average closed down only N points at N 
 late in the afternoon several big purchases by bear stearns particularly a block of N shares at N p.m. at $ N a share triggered a buying spree that took ual up more than N points in the final hour of trading 
 ual stock closed at $ N a share down $ N 
 volume was a tumultuous N million shares or N N of the N million ual shares outstanding 
 traders estimated that bear stearns bought more than N million shares 
 the two most frequently rumored buyers neither of whom would comment were coniston partners which battled the ual board in N and new york real estate developer donald trump who recently made and withdrew an offer for american airlines parent amr corp 
 however one person familiar with ual said the signs pointed to coniston because mr. trump has n't asked for permission to buy more than $ N million of stock under federal antitrust rules 
 takeover-stock traders <unk> by their huge losses in ual stock remained eager for some action by an outside catalyst following the collapse oct. N of a $ 300-a-share $ N billion labor-management buy-out 
 their hope was that the catalyst would seek to oust the board in a solicitation of shareholder <unk> 
 baker nye investments a new york takeover-stock trader that owns ual stock would n't comment on reports the firm is considering seeking such a shareholder vote 
 but partner richard nye said this is the most extraordinary failed transaction i 've seen in N years in this business 
 it would make sense for somebody to do it 
 i have never seen a case of <unk> shared by so many participants 
 in N baker nye <unk> a proxy fight for control of leaseway transportation inc. that ultimately led to leaseway 's being sold 
 some traders pointed hopefully to earlier estimates by ual 's investment adviser first boston corp. that <unk> could yield $ N to $ N a share 
 but those would require pilots ' cooperation 
 any investor who acquires ual stock in an attempt to force a buy-out or recapitalization must deal with united 's contentious unions 
 the pilots are working under an expired contract and the machinists contract expires next month 
 that gives them enormous leverage including the threat of a strike to block any buy-out or recapitalization attempt they oppose 
 however a catalyst like coniston could seek shareholder support for a sale to a labor-management group at the last price discussed by that group before the board meeting monday 
 the pilots had been working on a buy-out bid between $ N and $ N a share or $ N billion to $ N billion 
 one person familiar with ual said the unsettled labor situation and the uncertain world-wide financial markets contributed to the board 's decision to avoid rushing around selling the company at a bargain price particularly since it accepted a $ 300-a-share offer just last month 
 even some takeover-stock traders said they could n't <unk> with the board 's logic 
 but the board 's decision prompted many to bail out of the stock yesterday 
 we had a lot of people who threw in the towel today said <unk> ellis a partner in benjamin jacobson & sons a specialist in trading ual stock on the big board 
 another trader noted that many arbitrage firms are afraid to sell their ual stock at the bottom but already own so much they ca n't buy any more 
 this deal is like a <unk> motel he said 
 they check in but they ca n't check out 
 but both the traders and the pilots remain interested in some transaction 
 so too according to many reports is british airways plc despite its public withdrawal from the buy-out 
 the pilots might end up <unk> up with their longtime <unk> the machinists union in a recapitalization 
 the machinists are reviewing proposals they made in the past for <unk> that would pay a special shareholder dividend and give employees a minority stake 
 the company rejected those past proposals 
 it is unclear however if the machinists would support a majority stake as the pilots want 
 a <unk> official said that would depend on how much in concessions machinists would have to give in return for the majority stake 
 some investors whose names were <unk> about by traders as potential ual stock buyers said they were n't buying 
 i 'm not interested said dallas investor harold simmons 
 a source close to carl icahn a corporate raider who owns trans world airlines inc. said he has n't owned any ual stock and is n't buying 
 one person familiar with texas billionaire robert bass said he is n't likely to make any hostile moves 
 and a spokesman for reliance group holdings inc. which had held N N of ual before the first buy-out bid but later reduced its holdings below N N would n't comment 
 marvin davis whose $ N billion takeover bid originally put the nation 's second-largest airline in play is limited by a standstill agreement with ual he signed in september 
 the los angeles investor ca n't buy ual stock <unk> shareholder <unk> or make a new offer unless he makes a formal offer of $ N a share or ual <unk> an offer below $ N 
 however mr. davis could pressure the board by asking that the agreement be <unk> or letting it be known that he has financing for an offer at a lower price 
 times mirror co. said third-quarter net income fell N N to $ N million or N cents a share compared with net income of $ N million or N cents a share a year earlier 
 the los angeles media concern said that the year-ago period included a $ N million gain from the sale of assets primarily <unk> 
 revenue was $ N million up N N from $ N million 
 stronger results from the company 's broadcast and cable television units and professional and <unk> publishing divisions plus increased advertising at the company 's largest newspaper the los angeles times offset advertising declines in the company 's newspapers in the eastern u.s. the company said 
 looking ahead to the fourth quarter the outlook for the newspaper group remains <unk> with no improvement yet seen in operating trends in our eastern markets said robert f. <unk> times mirror 's chairman and chief executive 
 copper futures sold off sharply yesterday influenced by declines in the stock market and dollar and a rally in bonds 
 december copper opened near monday 's close tried to rally but failed and then triggered stop-loss orders on its way down to settle at $ N a pound off N cents for the day 
 stop-loss orders are placed previously with instructions to execute them if the market hits a <unk> price 
 william kaiser president of the kaiser financial group in chicago said the decline was almost certainly influenced by the early sell-off in the stock market which partly reflected a weakening economy 
 he said the recent decline in copper stocks was misleading in the face of a slowdown in manufacturing 
 mr. kaiser said traders could have picked up signals of an imminent price decline had they been watching the scrap metal markets which became <unk> weaker two to three weeks ago 
 but though a weakening economy implies reduced demand mr. kaiser said that third world <unk> countries have n't any choice but to sell copper 
 they might even step up sales in a falling market he said in an effort to maintain the flow of foreign exchange into their <unk> 
 technically mr. kaiser noted that a lot of traders had bought into the market when the price was in the $ N to $ N range thinking there was support at the $ N level 
 when the market fell below that level on monday and then yesterday could n't climb above that level traders started selling out their positions 
 <unk> <unk> senior metals analyst at prudential-bache securities in new york agreed that most of the selling was of a technical nature 
 she said the market hit the $ N level at around N a.m. edt where it encountered a large number of stop-loss orders 
 more stop-loss orders were touched off all the way down to below $ N where modest buying was attracted 
 ms. <unk> said the settling of strikes in canada and mexico will have little effect on supplies of copper until early next year 
 she thinks the next area of support for copper is in the $ N to $ N range 
 i believe that as soon as the selling <unk> somewhat we could see a rally back to the $ N region she added 
 she thinks a recovery in the stock market would help copper rebound as well 
 she noted that the preliminary estimate of the third-quarter gross national product is due out tomorrow and is expected to be up about N N to N N 
 if the number is a little better then copper will respond <unk> if it is worse then more selling could <unk> she predicted 
 ms. <unk> noted that relating economic numbers to specific market activity is tricky 
 yesterday for example the durable goods numbers came out for september and the number was down only N N she said 
 however if you exclude <unk> orders then durable goods were down N N 
 i believe that number reflects a slowing economy 
 she said copper traders will also be looking toward the release of the index of leading economic indicators next tuesday 
 however david <unk> president of <unk> & co. an international metals company noted that so far this year copper consumption is way ahead of the same period of N and that projected production is below last year 
 mr. <unk> said the copper market seems to be anticipating a recession in three months with declining use being the result 
 but he added we have had that exact same perception six times in the last six years 
 he noted that currently the ratio of available copper to consumption is about N weeks 
 he said the normal ratio is five to six weeks 
 according to mr. <unk> the <unk> in copper production is n't at the mines but at the copper refineries 
 it takes three months to turn copper concentrate into <unk> he said 
 if there is n't a recession he said we will be out of copper by the end of march 
 if there is a recession that will change the statistical situation 
 he thinks that without a recession copper prices could exceed a high of $ N a pound which was reached last year 
 in the past mr. <unk> has been known to have substantial long positions that is he had bought copper futures in anticipation of rising prices in the copper futures market 
 in other commodity markets yesterday 
 energy the attitude was <unk> in crude oil futures yesterday in trading on the new york mercantile exchange 
 prices for the u.s. benchmark west texas intermediate crude remained locked in a fairly narrow range before ending the session four cents lower at $ N a barrel for december delivery 
 several analysts and brokers said the petroleum market was ready to rally after two days of price declines from profit-taking 
 but an early <unk> drop in the dow jones industrial average stopped the crude rally cold 
 the industrial average recovered to close only N points lower but petroleum futures never shook off the <unk> 
 most market participants said they were looking to this week 's inventory statistics from the american petroleum institute to give the market some direction 
 the report is n't generally available until late on <unk> 
 precious metals futures prices inched upward in mostly lackluster trading 
 december gold was up $ N an ounce at $ N december silver gained N cents to $ N an ounce 
 january platinum rose $ N an ounce to $ N 
 mr. kaiser said there were no fundamental factors moving these markets 
 he noted that two weeks ago there were rumors of soviet sales of precious metals to finance grain purchases but the sales do n't seem to have materialized 
 ms. <unk> thought yesterday 's price action reflected weakness in the stock market and the dollar 
 gold still acts as a haven when uncertainty <unk> in the financial markets as it did yesterday she said 
 mr. kaiser noted that gold was more than N times the price of silver at the close yesterday which is historically high 
 the high ratio reflects the fact that silver is still regarded as about a <unk> metal and its price lagging relative to gold says that traders are expecting a weakening economy he said 
 grains and soybeans prices closed lower after trading in relatively narrow ranges because of strong selling in the cash market and continued favorable harvest weather 
 the sale to the chinese government of N metric tons of wheat under the government 's export <unk> program was announced after the close of trading monday but the sale was expected and failed to <unk> prices yesterday said dale <unk> a futures analyst with drexel burnham lambert inc. in chicago 
 as for other export customers the soviet union is n't expected to be back buying u.s. corn in significant amounts until early next year he said 
 a number of commercial grain users <unk> that opinion yesterday by buying certain corn options for delivery in march indicating to analysts that the commercial companies would use the options to hedge against expected corn sales in next year 's first quarter 
 cocoa futures at first continued the rally begun on monday but then faltered and closed lower 
 the december contract opened just under monday 's close triggered some previously placed buy orders just above $ N a metric ton pushing the price to $ N and then encountered heavy selling by traders who buy and sell for their own accounts and by commercial interests 
 the contract settled at $ N a ton off $ N 
 robert <unk> senior commodities analyst at kaiser financial group said monday 's rally continued yesterday for only about N minutes after the opening 
 he said even though there was arbitrage buying in new york because of the weak dollar cocoa fell to <unk> pressure from bearish traders 
 but he noted that speculators apparently do n't believe there is much more of a decline in store for cocoa 
 the december contract reached its <unk> low of $ N a ton on oct. N its lifetime high was $ N set in N and its recent high was $ N set in early august 
 the last time cocoa traded at prices as low as currently was in N 
 but while further modest declines might be ahead mr. <unk> said it would be difficult to get through resistance levels just above yesterday 's high 
 citizens first bancorp inc. said it agreed to buy <unk> first financial group inc. a <unk> n.j. bank holding company for about $ N million in cash and stock 
 citizens first which controls citizens first national bank and is based in <unk> rock n.j. will pay a maximum of N N in cash for the parent of <unk> savings bank and the remainder in convertible preferred stock with a liquidation value of $ N a share 
 <unk> holders will have the option to request either stock or cash 
 the convertible preferred will pay dividends at N N and be convertible into shares of citizens first at a rate equal to N N above the average closing price of the stock during a <unk> period prior to the transaction 's completion 
 the deal requires regulatory and shareholder approval 
 color systems technology inc. los angeles said its major creditor general electric pension trust agreed to convert $ N million of debt owed into N N of color system 's fully diluted common stock 
 the agreement also calls for general electric pension a unit of general electric co. to receive as much as N N of color systems ' fully diluted common stock depending on the proceeds from the sale of the <unk> film library and its receivables 
 general electric pension took control of the <unk> library last month after color systems defaulted on the loan 
 the agreement depends on color systems ' ability to win similar concessions from other creditors 
 buddy young president said the company expects to conclude negotiations with other creditors within N days 
 color systems which <unk> black-and-white film to color <unk> posted a loss of $ N million or $ N a share on revenue of $ N million for the fiscal year ended june N 
 its stock fell N cents to $ N in american stock exchange composite trading yesterday 
 next to kohlberg kravis roberts 's <unk> rjr nabisco deal sci television is small <unk> 
 but the troubles of sci tv are a classic tale of the leveraged buy-out excesses of the 1980s especially the <unk> game 
 sci tv which expects to release a plan to restructure $ N billion of debt in the next day or so is n't just another lbo that went bad after <unk> on debt though it did do that 
 the cable and tv station company was an lbo of an lbo a set of assets that were leveraged twice enabling the blue-chip buy-out king henry kravis in N to take more than $ N billion of cash out of the <unk> <unk> 
 sci tv 's buy-out was an <unk> in the hole for mr. kravis and for investors in kkr partnerships 
 but it has left holders of sci tv 's junk bonds holding the bag including some <unk> that kkr might need to finance future deals such as kemper financial services first executive columbia savings & loan and prudential insurance co. of america 
 some junk-holders are said to be considering legal action against kkr or moves to force sci tv into bankruptcy court 
 and kkr 's majority partner in sci tv 's buy-out <unk> tenn. entrepreneur george gillett also is said to be very unhappy 
 sci tv 's six stations once were part of storer communications 
 kkr loaded up the cable and television company with debt in an N buy-out then later sold storer 's cable operations at a fat profit 
 in N kkr for the second time <unk> debt onto storer 's tv stations selling them for $ N billion to a new entity that was <unk> by kkr and <unk> by gillett corp. which now operates the sci tv stations 
 in this second lbo kkr with one hand took more than $ N billion of cash out of the tv company 's assets and moved it into the storer cable operations making them more valuable in a N sale 
 storer also took $ N million of junior sci tv bonds as partial payment for the tv assets 
 with the other hand kkr put back into sci tv less than N N of the cash it had taken out buying sci tv common and preferred shares 
 so while kkr today has an estimated $ N million <unk> in <unk> sci tv including equity and debt the lbo firm still is $ N billion ahead on the sci tv buy-out after taking cash up front 
 on storer as a whole kkr racked up compound annual returns of N N in the three years it owned storer 
 meanwhile mr. gillett risks losing his entire equity investment of about $ N million in sci tv if the company ca n't be restructured 
 overall mr. gillett 's holding company gillett holdings is heavily <unk> and except for its <unk> mountain resorts is n't doing very well 
 with the tv business falling on hard times in recent years analysts say that if sci tv had to be liquidated today it might fetch N N less than in the N buy-out <unk> out most of the company 's junk-holders and its stockholders 
 meanwhile sci tv can barely pay its cash interest bill and to stay out of bankruptcy court it must soon <unk> a lot of bank loans and junk bonds that have fallen due 
 sci tv 's grace period for paying its bills is due to expire nov. N 
 it now is quietly circulating among creditors a preliminary plan to restructure debt 
 negotiations have started con <unk> but that 's not to say we like this particular offer says wilbur ross of rothschild inc. adviser to sci tv junk-holders 
 no major player in the sci tv deal will talk publicly 
 but it 's understood that mr. kravis is disappointed that mr. gillett did n't manage to boost sci tv 's operating profit after the buy-out 
 mr. kravis apparently thinks sci tv can survive if lenders extend its debt payments until tv stations rise in value again allowing sci tv to sell assets to pay debt 
 mr. gillett is said to be proud of his operating record he has lifted some stations ' ratings and turned around a detroit station 
 as for junk-holders they 're <unk> it can be a mistake to take the other side of a trade by kkr 
 the bonds of sci tv now are being quoted at prices ranging from only five cents to about N cents on the dollar according to <unk> smith & co. in new york which trades <unk> securities 
 people who have seen sci tv 's restructuring plan say it offers concessions by kkr and gillett corp 
 they would both give part of their combined $ N million in common equity in sci tv to holders of sci tv 's $ N million of junk bonds as a <unk> to persuade them to accept new bonds that might reduce the value of their claims on the company 
 but some <unk> sci tv junk-holders say that 's not enough 
 they contend that sci tv 's equity now is <unk> 
 they add that it is n't costing kkr anything to give up equity because of its big <unk> cash profit on the buy-out which they think contributed to sci tv 's current problems 
 kemper the biggest holder of senior sci tv bonds has refused to join the <unk> committee and is said to be reviewing its legal options 
 to protect their claims some junk-holders want kkr and perhaps mr. gillett to invest new money in sci tv perhaps $ N million or more 
 one investment banker who is n't involved in the deal says sci tv needs at least $ N million of new equity to survive 
 junk-holders say they have a stick to beat kkr with the threat of bankruptcy is a legitimate tool to extract money from kkr says one big sci tv holder 
 this could be the first major bankruptcy-law proceeding for kkr he adds 
 a big bankruptcy-court case might <unk> kkr 's name and provide new fuel for critics of lbos in washington and elsewhere 
 but others say junk-holders have nothing to gain by putting sci tv into bankruptcy-law proceedings 
 while kkr does n't control sci tv which is unusual for a kkr investment it clearly has much deeper pockets than mr. gillett 
 bankruptcy specialists say mr. kravis set a precedent for putting new money in sour lbos recently when kkr restructured <unk> <unk> furniture doubling kkr 's equity stake 
 but with <unk> kkr was only trying to salvage its original investment says bankruptcy investor james rubin of <unk> <unk> rubin in new york 
 by contrast kkr probably has already made all the money it can on sci tv 
 and people who know mr. kravis say he is n't in a hurry to pour more money into sci tv 
 rubbermaid inc. reflecting strong earnings growth boosted its quarterly dividend N N to N cents a share from N cents 
 the maker of household products said the new dividend is payable dec. N to shares of record nov. N 
 separately the company 's board adopted a proposal to <unk> its N shareholder rights plan further <unk> the company from takeover 
 rubbermaid officials said they are n't aware of any effort to take over the company but believed the shareholder plan needed to be strengthened 
 the board has stated repeatedly that rubbermaid should be independent said walter w. williams rubbermaid president 
 some changes to the plan were minor adjustments but the most significant was an amendment that provides that if any investor holds N N or more of rubbermaid 's voting securities each right held by others would <unk> the holder to buy rubbermaid shares with a market value of twice the right 's exercise price 
 mr. williams said the exercise price is $ N meaning holders would have the right to buy $ N of rubbermaid stock for half price <unk> the investor 's N N stake 
 for the third quarter rubbermaid earned $ N million or N cents a share up N N from $ N million or N cents a share a year earlier 
 sales rose N N to $ N million from $ N million 
 rubbermaid shares closed yesterday at $ N off N cents in new york stock exchange composite trading 
 the stock market went on a dizzying ride as ual parent of united airlines once again led shares into a <unk> decline and then an afternoon comeback 
 at the end of it all the dow jones industrial average closed down N to N 
 at one point yesterday morning the dow was down N points 
 new york stock exchange volume was N shares 
 declining issues <unk> advancers N to N 
 yesterday 's sell-off and rebound was a powerful reminder that N days after the 190-point plunge on friday the 13th the stock market still has a bad case of nerves 
 takeover stock speculation and futures-related program trading drove the industrial average through wide ranges 
 and there is more volatility to come 
 october 13th left us with a cut and exposed <unk> said jack <unk> technical analyst for bear stearns 
 people are fearful and sensitive 
 everybody 's finger is one inch closer to the <unk> 
 i have never had as many calls as i had this morning 
 volatility is here to stay 
 the dow jones industrial average plunged about N points in slightly more than one hour after the opening bell 
 for many it began to look like a <unk> of oct. N 
 as stocks and stock-index futures fell a trading limit was hit in the s&p N stock futures pit 
 under a <unk> crash reform the chicago mercantile exchange would n't permit the december s&p futures to fall further than N points for a half hour 
 that caused a brief period of panic selling of stocks on the big board 
 but at a critical moment stock-index arbitrage traders showed their power and control 
 they <unk> up hundreds of s&p futures when the market needed it most 
 at about N a.m. edt several big buy orders hit the s&p pit simultaneously lifting the futures up out of the trading limit and eventually into ranges that caused computer-driven program buying of stocks 
 it is very clear that those buy orders came from people who wanted their franchise protected said one chicago-based futures trader 
 these guys wanted to do something to show how powerful they are 
 traders said goldman sachs shearson lehman hutton and salomon brothers were the main force behind the futures buying at the <unk> moment 
 shearson lehman hutton declined to comment 
 officials at goldman sachs and salomon brothers were unavailable for comment 
 as in the oct. N massacre yesterday morning 's drop was triggered by bad news for speculators in ual 
 a ual statement after the market closed monday indicated that the airline 's board wanted to keep the company independent effectively <unk> hopes of an immediate buy-out 
 five minutes before the big board opened a preliminary price was <unk> for ual somewhere between N and N a loss of as much as $ N a share from monday 's close 
 ual finally opened for trading at N a.m. at N down $ N 
 floor traders said there was a huge crowd around the big board specialist 's post where ual trades 
 there was a <unk> mass of people said one floor trader 
 then there was a big liquidation of stock across the board he added 
 takeover speculators who have already taken a record loss estimated at more than $ N million on ual started selling other stocks as well as s&p futures in an attempt to hedge against a further ual blood <unk> 
 shortly after the ual opening program traders started selling stocks in the major market index and s&p N index 
 the <unk> mmi <unk> the dow jones industrial average 
 by N a.m. the dow was down N 
 all <unk> in the mmi except exxon general motors and sears were down $ N to $ N 
 at N when the s&p N december futures contract <unk> to a <unk> loss under the force of sell programs s&p futures trading was halted and program trades on the big board were <unk> into a special computer that <unk> for order imbalances 
 under the rules adopted by the chicago mercantile exchange the futures contract can not drop below the limit but buyers can purchase futures 
 at this point the dow industrials were down N points and falling 
 the trading halt in the s&p N futures <unk> selling and confusion many traders maintain 
 but as the <unk> began to spread through the s&p pit the big brokerage firms came in and bought futures aggressively 
 it was <unk> said one futures trader 
 in five minutes the dow industrials climbed almost N points 
 the big futures buying triggered stock-index buy programs that eventually trimmed the dow 's loss to N points by N a.m 
 traders said the futures buying was <unk> calculated by program traders 
 these firms sold stock into the big morning decline but seeing the <unk> of the market 's drop held back on their offsetting purchases of futures until the s&p futures hit the trading limit 
 then they completed the other side of the trade by buying futures which abruptly halted the stock market 's decline as traders began to buy stocks 
 from then on the dow industrials held at a loss of N to N points 
 then in <unk> trading <unk> buy orders for ual hit the market including a <unk> order through bear stearns that seemed to spark ual 's late price surge 
 almost simultaneously painewebber began a very visible buy program for dozens of stocks 
 the combined buying rallied the dow into a small gain before closing at a slight loss 
 some institutional traders loved the wild ride 
 this is fun asserted susan del <unk> head equity trader at travelers investment management co

 traders attributed rallies in a number of stocks to a japanese buy program that painewebber carried out as part of a shift in portfolio strategy according to dow jones professional investor report 
 dow jones climbed N N to N on very heavy volume of N shares

 a dow jones spokesman said there were no corporate developments that would account for the activity

 after being <unk> by a volatile stock market treasury bonds closed higher 
 but junk bonds took more hits 
 early in the day bond dealers said trading volume was heavy as large institutional investors scrambled to buy long-term treasury bonds on speculation that the stock market 's volatility would lead to a <unk> rally 
 that happens when nervous stock investors dump equities and buy treasurys which are higher in quality and thus considered safe 
 some retail accounts such as commercial banks and pension funds wanted to get on the <unk> before it was too late said sung won <unk> chief economist at <unk> corp. minneapolis 
 at one point the dow jones industrial average fell about N points on news that ual corp. decided to remain independent 
 in response treasury prices soared N N points or about $ N for each $ N face amount 
 but the gains in treasury bonds were <unk> as stocks staged a partial recovery 
 the industrial average ended at N down N points 
 economists said the bond market 's strength also is a sign that investors expect the federal reserve to cut interest rates amid growing evidence that the economy is slowing 
 while they do n't expect the fed to move right away they say the case for lower rates is building 
 yesterday for example the commerce department reported that new orders for durable goods fell N N while the nation 's auto makers reported lackluster mid-october sales 
 the treasury 's 30-year bond ended over N point higher 
 municipal mortgage-backed and investment-grade corporate bonds rose N to N point

 rjr 's N N bonds due N fell N N points 
 trading activity in the junk market was extremely light as dealers could n't find enough buyers to match sellers 
 while the stock market was falling most junk bond holders were just watching it not knowing what to do said paul <unk> director of fixed-income securities at oppenheimer management corp 
 it was like driving down the highway watching a <unk> 
 everybody was <unk> 
 adding to the junk market 's jitters were reports that donaldson lufkin & jenrette securities corp. is having trouble <unk> a $ N billion offering for tw food services inc. and will postpone or even cancel the issue 
 tw is the largest franchisee of <unk> 's a fast-food restaurant and operates several other food chains 
 donaldson lufkin would n't comment

 also the tw offering includes <unk> and <unk> securities which are currently unpopular 
 meanwhile investors turned a cold shoulder to the treasury 's sale of $ N billion of new two-year notes yesterday 
 it 's not too surprising that the auction was sloppy given the volatility in the bond market because of stocks said robert t. <unk> a senior vice president at <unk> bank ltd 
 people are looking past supply to lower interest rates but they 're also worried about being <unk> by the volatility in the stock market

 sluggish demand was also <unk> by the weak <unk> <unk> ratio which was lower than the average <unk> ratio at the last N similar auctions 
 the ratio which reflects the number of bids the treasury receives for each bid accepted is used to gauge investor demand 
 dealers said players <unk> away from the note sale because they were concerned that prices at the time of the auction might erode if the stock market staged a recovery which in fact did happen 
 individual and japanese participation in the auction was disappointing according to dealers 
 interest by japanese investors was limited said michael <unk> chief economist at daiwa securities america inc 
 they are typically not active in two-year note auctions but today 's participation could be viewed as <unk> 
 however mr. <unk> added that the japanese generally have a positive view of the u.s. bond market because of expectations that the dollar will remain strong and interest rates will decline 
 he said possibly they 're waiting to buy at the quarterly refunding of government debt to be held next month by the treasury 
 a trader at a japanese firm estimated that the japanese purchased no more than N N of the two-year notes 
 treasury agency securities 
 today investors will focus on the long-awaited auction of $ N billion of 30-year bonds by resolution funding corp 
 the initial bond offering by the new government agency which was created to help rescue the nation 's troubled thrifts is n't expected to see robust demand 
 a small yield premium over comparable treasurys and a lack of liquidity is <unk> dealers ' efforts to drum up interest in the so-called bailout bonds 
 in when-issued trading the refcorp bonds were quoted at a price to yield N N 
 yesterday the benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late at N N to yield N N compared with N N to yield N N on monday 
 the latest 10-year treasury was quoted at N N to yield N N compared with N N to yield N N 
 short-term rates were unchanged to slightly lower 
 the discount rate on three-month treasury bills was quoted at N N for a bond-equivalent yield of N N while the rate on six-month treasury bills was quoted at N N for a yield of N N 
 rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value 
 thus higher bidding narrows the investor 's return while lower bidding widens it

 a # N million $ N million british airways plc rights issue <unk> badly the victim of recent market turbulence and the collapse of the buy-out bid for united airlines ' parent ual corp 
 the united kingdom carrier had planned the issue to help finance its $ N million purchase of a N N stake in ual 
 but british airways withdrew from the ual labor-management buy-out plan last friday after the group failed to get bank financing for its $ N billion buy-out 
 british airways said its shareholders accepted only N N of the convertible capital bonds but that the rest of the issue will be taken up by underwriters 
 analysts said that N N level marked the poorest showing for any major british rights issue since the N global stock market crash 
 it is close to being a record <unk> said bob <unk> an analyst with london broker smith new court securities 
 fund managers do n't like to have rights issues that do n't have an obvious reason 
 the obvious reason was for british air to buy a stake in united airlines 
 in a statement british air chairman lord king said the company was obviously disappointed that the issue was not taken up but it would have been <unk> to expect a better result given the volatility of the stock market since the launch of the issue 
 but except for the embarrassment british air will emerge relatively <unk> from the <unk> issue 
 underwriters led by lazard brothers & co. will pick up the rest of the airline 's offer of four convertible capital bonds for every nine common shares 
 lazard and other primary underwriters have reduced or eliminated their exposure by <unk> the issue among u.k. institutional investors 
 the paper loss here is very small for these <unk> observed john nelson a lazard managing director 
 in any case he added most institutions probably wo n't sell the bonds 
 and instead of buying the ual stake the u.k. carrier will be able to reduce its high debt level and build an acquisition war <unk> 
 from a cash flow point of view british airways is better off not being in united airlines in the short term said andy chambers an analyst at nomura research institute in london 
 added another u.k. analyst it gives them some cash in the back <unk> for when they want to do something 
 for instance british air is continuing to negotiate with <unk> royal dutch airlines about each acquiring a N N stake in <unk> world airlines the air transport subsidiary of the belgian national airline 
 a definitive agreement had been expected by the end of july 
 the failed rights issue also should have a modest impact on british air shares 
 the airline 's share price already is far below the N pence $ N level seen after the company announced the rights issue in late september 
 in late trading on london 's stock exchange yesterday the shares were off three pence at N pence 
 and because british air is issuing convertible bonds rather than ordinary shares the share price wo n't be directly hurt by any surplus left with underwriters after they try to sell the issue in the open market 
 but british air 's withdrawal from the ual buy-out could have further <unk> 
 some analysts speculated yesterday that the move has set off a board room split which may lead to the resignation of sir <unk> marshall the carrier 's chief executive officer 
 the stories are <unk> a british air spokesman said

 in an oct. N editorial-page article it 's the world bank 's turn to adjust paul craig roberts <unk> most of the blame for what <unk> developing countries at the <unk> of the world bank 
 the article is unfortunately <unk> with <unk> <unk> 
 one of mr. roberts 's <unk> is that the bank 's own loan portfolio is in deep trouble because of its lending to developing countries 
 this is just not so 
 the reality is that bank finances are rock solid 
 as of june N N the day our past fiscal year came to a close only N N of the bank 's portfolio was affected by <unk> of over six months 
 this is an <unk> low level 
 moreover the bank follows a prudent <unk> policy and has set aside $ N million against possible loan losses 
 for the same fiscal year by the way the bank 's net income was a robust $ N billion after provisions 
 because of the <unk> manner in which the bank goes about development financial markets have confidence in it 
 this helps explain the triple-a rating enjoyed by our bonds and our ability to borrow $ N billion in fiscal N on the most <unk> terms 
 another of mr. roberts 's criticisms is that bank lending has done more harm than good by <unk> the wrong incentives and <unk> energy away from economic development 
 here too mr. roberts is way off the mark 
 the reality is that bank loans have been linked to policy improvements for N years 
 our traditional project loans have for instance supported <unk> energy pricing in the power sector sound interest-rate policies in the credit area and the operation of public utilities as efficient <unk> agencies 
 by and large these efforts have <unk> fruit 
 in my home region latin america much of the existing infrastructure base an important building block for development has been financed by the world bank 
 mr. roberts also takes a <unk> at the bank 's adjustment lending 
 what are the facts on this type of lending 
 the bank has been making adjustment loans for N years 
 as their name implies these operations are linked to far-reaching policy reforms that aim at helping borrowing countries get back on the growth path and at <unk> their <unk> 
 typically these measures include reforms to <unk> the role of government and <unk> in the economy to open up <unk> economies to international competition and to promote the development of a vigorous private sector 
 support for the private sector has been a longstanding concern of the bank 's 
 over the years it has helped encourage investments by entrepreneurs in the third world through its extensive credit operations and through loans and investments by the international finance corp 
 most recently the bank group has been expanded to include the <unk> investment guarantee agency to stimulate direct foreign investment in developing countries by offering guarantees against <unk> risk and advice to member countries on how to improve their business climate 
 these are not the actions of a development agency <unk> to central planning and to the concentration of investment decisions in the hands of government as mr. roberts alleges 
 rather they reflect the bank 's <unk> <unk> approach which aims at ensuring that developing countries put their scarce resources to the best possible use

 the government said it would streamline its enormous and <unk> food marketing and distribution network <unk> <unk> de <unk> <unk> or conasupo 
 conasupo director <unk> <unk> fernandez said the agency will sell N midsized supermarkets and several <unk> plants and warehouses beginning early next year 
 the agency will withdraw from the production of nine food products maintaining production of the two most important ones corn and milk 
 mr. <unk> also said conasupo will cut back subsidies to producers of <unk> farm products and close retail outlets in wealthy neighborhoods 
 the agency 's workers and private companies would be allowed to bid for the assets up for sale 
 conasupo controls prices on agricultural goods and operates retail outlets where basic consumer items are sold at <unk> prices 
 business leaders have long criticized the agency as a leading example of <unk> waste 
 private-sector leaders praised the conasupo restructuring 
 but most economists doubt the streamlining would cut deeply into conasupo government subsidy which largely goes to reduce consumer prices for corn and milk 
 the food and drug administration banned all imports of mushrooms from china in response to a rash of <unk> <unk> linked to <unk> chinese mushrooms 
 the agency has concluded that <unk> may be widespread throughout the <unk> industry in china an fda spokesman said yesterday 
 the agency wo n't allow mushrooms that were <unk> or packed in <unk> at any chinese plant to enter the u.s. until satisfactory <unk> measures are implemented in china to prevent <unk> <unk> 
 on may N the fda began <unk> chinese mushrooms in <unk> cans after more than N people in mississippi new york and pennsylvania became ill from eating tainted mushrooms

 the <unk> were <unk> to <unk> <unk> a type of bacteria that produces a toxin capable of surviving the high temperatures used in <unk> <unk> 
 a recall of the mushrooms blamed for the food <unk> began in early march 
 in N china exported N million pounds of mushrooms valued at $ N million to the u.s.

 your sept. N politics & policy article about william bennett 's emergency drug plan for washington gives the impression that the fbi has not been nor is actively involved 
 this is not the case 
 the fbi is very supportive of and an active participant in mr. bennett 's initiative 
 it was agreed at the outset of the washington drug initiative that the fbi 's role would be to continue targeting the major drug traffickers through our national drug strategy 
 through these investigations we do not focus on the street drug user but rather we target and attack major <unk> organizations that control a large segment of the drug market 
 the trial of <unk> <unk> iii in washington serves to highlight our efforts in this area and the results achieved through our excellent working relationship with the drug enforcement administration and the metropolitan police department <unk> 
 the fbi 's role is to <unk> the d.c. initiative through not only these major trafficking investigations but also by providing a full range of services through various task forces and our contacts with local police <unk> handling drug-related crimes 
 in fact we have agents assigned full time to assist the <unk> in drug-related crimes such as <unk> and other crimes of violence

 the wall street journal american way of buying survey consists of two separate <unk> nationwide polls conducted for the journal by peter d. hart research associates and the roper organization

 the poll conducted by the roper organization interviewed N adults age N and older from july N to july N N 
 responses were weighted on the basis of age and <unk> to conform with u.s. census data 
 for each poll the odds are N out of N that if <unk> had sought to survey every household in the u.s. using the same <unk> the findings would differ from these poll results by no more than N N percentage points in either direction 
 the margin of error for <unk> for example married women with children at home would be larger 
 in addition in any survey there is always the chance that other factors such as question <unk> could introduce errors into the findings

 meredith corp. is launching a new service to offer advertisers package deals combining its book magazine and videocassette products 
 the des <unk> publisher said it created a new custom marketing group that will offer advertisers special rates for combination packages in its magazines such as <unk> home journal and better homes and gardens 
 in addition the group will create <unk> media such as <unk> newspaper <unk> and <unk> for ad campaigns 
 earlier this year meredith sold its first such package for $ N million to kraft inc. now a unit of new york-based philip morris <unk> 
 the kraft package included a specially published <unk> a national <unk> <unk> in sunday newspapers and a kraft <unk> section that ran in five meredith magazines 
 kraft recently agreed to spend an additional $ N million on similar programs through N 
 bill murphy director of the new marketing unit said meredith is negotiating other large-scale packages with leading companies in several product categories but he would n't disclose their names 
 sources close to the company and ad agencies that work with meredith said leading advertisers in consumer electronics packaged goods and automotive products were among those negotiating ad packages with the meredith group 
 other magazine publishing companies have been moving in the same direction 
 the new york times co. 's magazine group earlier this year began offering advertisers extensive merchandising services built around buying ad pages in its golf digest magazine 
 time warner inc. recently formed a <unk> department to seek out ways to offer advertisers packages that could combine time 's magazines with warner products such as <unk> 
 paul <unk> director of media services at grey advertising said meredith is the leader in providing <unk> packages 
 they may get passed up later when other publishers get their acts together but for now they are the <unk> offering the most extensive plan he said 
 mr. murphy of meredith said one advertiser which he would n't identify wants meredith to provide ad pages in seven meredith magazines publish an <unk> book that will be distributed at point of purchase give away a <unk> on installation <unk> and possibly use meredith 's better homes and gardens ' residential real-estate agents to distribute <unk> books to new homeowners

 the management turnover at reebok international ltd. continued with the resignation of company president c. joseph <unk> who joined reebok just two years ago 
 mr. <unk> 's departure follows by two months the resignation of mark <unk> as senior vice president and chief marketing officer after only N months at reebok 
 the resignations by the two executives considered <unk> and <unk> by reebok insiders reflect a difference in style with paul fireman chairman and chief executive according to several former executives 
 the two executives are among a number of outsiders recruited by reebok in the past few years to help it make the transition from a small start-up company to a marketing giant with sales last year of $ N billion 
 the changes come as reebok which grew rapidly in the mid-1980s but has seen its sales <unk> of late is seeking to regain momentum in the <unk> business against rivals <unk> inc. and l.a. gear inc 
 the departures said alice ruth an analyst at montgomery securities in san francisco should enable the company to focus on business issues instead of management differences 
 i think it 's more an issue of style 
 i would view it as a net positive 
 the company can go about its business 
 they 're in the midst of a turnaround she noted 
 earnings have rebounded in N after a N N decline last year 
 a former executive agreed that the departures do n't reflect major problems adding if you see any company that grows as fast as reebok did it is going to have people coming and going

 and time warner inc. is developing a spinoff of time magazine aimed at kids on the heels of its successful sports illustrated for kids 
 over the past four years the number of consumer magazines has increased by an average of N magazines annually according to donald <unk> president of the magazine publishers of america 
 this is an impressive show of faith in the future of the magazine industry said mr. <unk> 
 entrepreneurs do n't rush to get into a <unk> or declining industry 
 and despite the recent tough advertising climate industry figures released at the meeting here indicate things may be turning around 
 for the first nine months advertising pages in consumer magazines tracked by the publishers information bureau increased N N from the same period last year to N pages 
 total magazine ad revenue for the same period increased N N to $ N billion 
 though for some magazines categories a tough advertising climate <unk> the industry in general is doing well compared with the newspaper industry 
 though some magazines are thriving the magazine publishing industry remains a risky business

 meanwhile american health partners publisher of american health magazine is deep in debt and owen <unk> founder and managing partner is being forced to sell the magazine to reader 's digest association inc 
 mr. <unk> 's absence from the meeting here raised speculation that the sale is in trouble 
 mr. <unk> said in a telephone interview from new york that the sale was proceeding as planned 
 the magazine is strong 
 it 's simply the right time to do what we are doing mr. <unk> said 
 magazines can no longer be considered institutions said james <unk> president of meredith corp. 's magazine group 
 publishers will find that some magazines have served their purpose and should die he added 
 magazines could like other brands find that they have only a limited life 
 there are also indications that the number of magazine entrepreneurs traditionally depended upon to break new ground with potentially risky <unk> are <unk> 
 more than ever independent magazines and small publishing groups are being <unk> up by larger publishing groups such as american express publishing corp. a unit of american express co. and <unk> <unk> publications inc. a unit of advance publications inc. which are consolidating in order to gain leverage with advertisers

 among other services the firm provides pre-trial opinion polls creates <unk> of ideal jurors sets up <unk> trials and shadow <unk> coaches lawyers and witnesses and designs courtroom graphics 
 much like their <unk> in political consulting and product marketing the litigation advisers encourage their clients to play down complex or <unk> matters <unk> their messages and provide their target audiences with a psychological <unk> to make the <unk> choice 
 with jury <unk> getting bigger all the time companies are increasingly willing to pay huge sums for such advice 
 recently litigation sciences helped pennzoil co. win a $ N billion jury verdict against texaco inc 
 it advised the national football league in its largely successful defense of antitrust charges by the united states football league 
 and it helped win defense <unk> in <unk> suits involving scores of products ranging from <unk> N tires to the <unk> drug <unk> 
 largely as a result litigation sciences has more than doubled in size in the past two years 
 its N revenue was $ N million 
 meanwhile competitors are being spawned almost daily some N new businesses many just <unk> shops have <unk> up 
 mr. vinson estimates the industry 's total revenues approach $ N million 
 in any <unk> case you can be sure that one side or the other or even both is using litigation consultants 
 despite their <unk> the consultants are n't entirely welcome 
 some lawyers and scholars see the social scientists ' vision of the american jury system as a far cry from the ideal presented in <unk> <unk> and <unk> on the movie screen

 litigation consulting is as new york trial attorney donald <unk> puts it highly <unk> 
 he adds the notion they try to sell is that <unk> do n't make decisions <unk> 
 but the effort is also being made to try and cause jurors not to decide things <unk> 
 i find it troubling 
 but mr. <unk> also acknowledges that consultants can be very effective 
 it 's gotten to the point where if the case is large enough it 's almost <unk> not to use them he says 
 others complain that the consultants ' growing influence <unk> the advantage of <unk> wealthy enough to afford such <unk> services 
 the affluent people and the corporations can buy it the poor <unk> in political cases get it free and everybody in between is at a disadvantage and that 's not the kind of system we want says <unk> <unk> a prominent sociologist who teaches at george washington university 
 sophisticated trial consulting grew ironically from the radical political movements of the 1960s and 1970s before finding its more lucrative calling in big commercial cases 
 the <unk> N trial in N in which daniel <unk> and others were charged with <unk> <unk> violence was a landmark 
 in that case a group of <unk> <unk> interviewed N registered voters around <unk> 
 the researchers discovered that <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> were nearly always against the defendants the lawyers resolved to try to keep them off the jury 
 the defense also learned that <unk> people were <unk> conservative about the vietnam war 
 a more blue-collar panel became a second aim 
 ultimately that carefully picked jury <unk> with a N vote to <unk> and the prosecution decided not to <unk> the case 
 litigation consulting had arrived 
 the fledgling science went corporate in N when international business machines corp. hired a marketing professor to help defend a complex antitrust case 
 the problem for ibm trial lawyers thomas <unk> and david <unk> was how to make such a highly technical case <unk> 
 as the trial <unk> they were eager to know if the jury was keeping up with them 
 the solution devised by the professor was to hire six people who would mirror the actual jury <unk> sit in on the trial and report their reactions to him 
 he then <unk> messrs. <unk> and <unk> who had the chance to tilt their next day 's presentation <unk> 
 thus the shadow jury was born 
 mr. vinson the professor got the law <unk> and formed litigation sciences 
 ibm won the case 
 the hardest thing in any complex case is to retain <unk> and in some sense your ignorance says mr. <unk> of <unk> <unk> & moore 
 what you look for in a shadow jury is very much what you do when you give an opening argument to your wife or a friend and get some response to it 
 a shadow jury is a way to do that in a more <unk> and organized way 
 the approach worked well in the recent antitrust case in which energy transportation systems inc. sued santa fe pacific corp. over the transport of <unk> coal the kind of case likely to make almost anyone 's eyes <unk> over 
 energy transportation retained litigation sciences at a cost of several hundred thousand dollars to poll <unk> profile and shadow 
 just before the actual closing arguments the firm put the case to a vote of the five shadow jurors each of whom was being paid $ N a day 
 the jurors who did n't know which side had retained them decided for energy transportation and awarded $ N million in damages 
 the real jury returned days later with a $ N million victory for energy transportation 
 it 's just like weather forecasting says energy transportation trial attorney harry <unk> of vinson & <unk> 
 it 's often wrong but it 's better than consulting an indian rain <unk> 
 forecasting is only one part of litigation sciences ' work 
 changing the outcome of the trial is what really matters 
 and to the <unk> some of the firm 's approaches may seem <unk> <unk> 
 <unk> jurors are supposed to weigh the evidence in a case <unk> and <unk> 
 instead mr. vinson says interviews with thousands of jurors reveal that they start with firmly entrenched attitudes and try to <unk> the facts of the case to fit their views 
 pre-trial <unk> helps the consultants develop a profile of the right type of <unk> 
 if it is a case in which the client seeks punitive damages for example depressed <unk> people are far more likely to grant them 
 someone with a master 's degree in classical arts who works in a <unk> would be ideal litigation sciences advises 
 so would someone recently <unk> or <unk> 
 since litigation sciences generally represents the defense its job is usually to help the lawyers identify and remove such people from the jury 
 for personal-injury cases litigation sciences seeks defense jurors who believe that most people including victims get what they deserve 
 such people also typically hold negative attitudes toward the <unk> handicapped the poor blacks and women 
 the consultants help the defense lawyers find such jurors by asking questions about potential jurors ' attitudes toward volunteer work or toward particular movies or books 
 litigation sciences does n't make moral <unk> 
 if a client needs <unk> jurors the firm will help find them 
 as mr. vinson explains it we do n't control the facts 
 they are what they are 
 but any lawyer will select the facts and the strategy to employ 
 in our system of <unk> the trial lawyer is duty bound to present the best case he possibly can 
 once a jury is selected the consultants often continue to determine what the jurors ' attitudes are likely to be and help shape the lawyers ' presentation <unk> 
 logic plays a minimal role here 
 more important are what lsi calls psychological <unk> a few <unk> points calculated to appeal to the jury on a gut level 
 in one personal-injury case a woman claimed she had been injured when she slipped in a pool but the fall did n't explain why one of her arms was <unk> <unk> 
 by repeatedly drawing the jury 's attention to the arm the defense lawyers planted doubt about the <unk> of the woman 's injuries 
 the <unk> worked 
 the defense won 
 in a classic defense of a personal-injury case the consultants concentrate on encouraging the jury to shift the blame 
 the ideal defense in a case involving an accident is to persuade the jurors to hold the accident victim responsible for his or her plight mr. vinson has written 
 <unk> graphics <unk> for effectiveness also play a major role in litigation sciences ' operation 
 studies show the consultants say that people absorb information better and remember it longer if they receive it <unk> 
 <unk> <unk> help 
 the average american watches seven hours of tv a day 
 they are very <unk> sophisticated explains lsi graphics specialist robert <unk> 
 lawyers remain divided about whether anything is wrong with all this 
 supporters acknowledge that the process aims to manipulate but they insist that the best trial lawyers have always employed similar tactics 
 they may not have been able to <unk> it all but they did it says stephen <unk> a legal ethics expert at new york university law school 
 what you have here is <unk> made <unk> 
 many lawyers maintain that all 's fair in the adversary system as long as no one <unk> with the evidence 
 others point out that lawyers in small communities have always had a feel for public sentiment and used that to advantage 
 litigation consulting is n't a guarantee of a favorable outcome 
 litigation sciences concedes that in one in N cases it was <unk> wrong in its predictions 
 a few attorneys offer <unk> stories of jobs <unk> by consultants or of <unk> services as when one lawyer paid a consultant not at litigation sciences $ N to interview a jury after a big trial and later read more <unk> interviews with the same jurors in the american lawyer magazine 
 some <unk> <unk> at the notion that a sociologist knows more than they do about what makes a jury <unk> 
 the <unk> of being a trial lawyer is understanding how people of diverse backgrounds react to you and your presentation says barry <unk> of simpson <unk> & bartlett who recently won a huge case on behalf of insurers against shell oil co 
 he says he used consultants in the case but found them to be virtually <unk> 
 but most lawyers accept that the marketplace has spoken 
 and the question remains whether the jury system can maintain its integrity while <unk> such a <unk> massage 
 for more than a decade mr. <unk> the sociologist has been a leading critic of the <unk> 
 there 's no reason to believe that <unk> rule <unk> he says 
 but the last thing you want to do is manipulate the <unk> to make them think better 
 what you then do is you make them think <unk> 
 to <unk> the work of litigation scientists he suggests that courts sharply limit the number of jurors that lawyers can remove from the jury panel through so-called <unk> challenges <unk> that do n't require <unk> 
 in most civil cases judges allow each side three such challenges 
 for complex cases judges sometimes allow many more 
 mr. <unk> also suggests <unk> anyone from gathering background information about the jurors 
 some courts release names and addresses and researchers can drive by houses look up credit ratings and even question neighbors 
 furthermore he says <unk> should not be allowed to analyze jurors ' <unk> 
 even some lawyers who have used consultants to their advantage see a need to limit their impact 
 mr. <unk> the first lawyer to use mr. vinson 's services <unk> against courts ' allowing extensive jury questioning known as <unk> dire or giving out personal information about the jurors 
 the more extensive the <unk> dire the easier you make it for that kind of research to be effective and i do n't think courts should lend themselves to that mr. <unk> says 
 silicon graphics inc. a fast-growing maker of computer workstations said it landed two federal government contracts worth more than $ N million over the next five years 
 one award is part of a department of defense contract to loral <unk> <unk> computers and could be valued at more than $ N million over five years 
 the other involves the sale of about N of the company 's high-end workstations to the national institutes of health 
 the models which cost about $ N each will be used in research 
 the <unk> are evidence that silicon graphics ' approach to computer graphics is catching on with users of powerful desktop computers analysts said 
 the company 's on a roll said robert <unk> an analyst at hambrecht & quist 
 no other computer vendor offers graphics performance that good for their price 
 in the battle to supply desktop computers for researchers and design engineers most of the attention is given to the biggest competitors sun microsystems inc. hewlett-packard co. and digital equipment corp. which make computers mainly aimed at a wide range of engineering and scientific needs 
 silicon graphics on the other hand has targeted a specific niche since its inception in N which has been dubbed by some as <unk> computing 
 this is a style of <unk> computing that provides <unk> color models of everything from the inside of a house to the latest in women 's fashion 
 though silicon graphics is much smaller than digital <unk> and sun it has emerged in recent years as a feared adversary in this graphics portion of the workstation market 
 in addition the company has made it tough on competitors by offering a stream of desktop computers at sharply lower prices 
 a year ago silicon graphics introduced a model priced at $ N almost as cheap as mainstream workstations that do n't offer special graphics features 
 silicon graphics also plans to unveil even less expensive machines in the near future 
 it 's pretty safe to assume we can bring the cost down of these systems by N N to N N a year said edward <unk> the company 's chief executive officer 
 silicon graphics ' strategy seems to be paying off 
 revenue for its first quarter ended sept. N was $ N million a N N increase over the year-ago period 
 profit was $ N million compared with $ N million for the year-ago quarter 
 remember those <unk> <unk> refrigerators of N years ago 
 they or at least something less efficient than today 's <unk> units may soon be making a comeback 
 that something whatever it is could add as much as $ N to the $ N or so consumers now pay for <unk> refrigerators 
 these and other expensive changes in products ranging from auto air <unk> to foam <unk> to commercial <unk> are in prospect because of something called the montreal protocol signed by N nations in N 
 in one of the most sweeping environmental regulatory efforts to date involving products with an annual value of $ N billion in the u.s. alone the <unk> agreed to curtail sharply the use of chlorofluorocarbons cfcs 
 world-wide production would be cut in half by N 
 the u.s. senate liked the treaty so well it ratified it by a vote of N to N 
 not to be <unk> george bush wants cfcs <unk> altogether by the year N a goal endorsed at an <unk> u.n. environmental meeting in <unk> in the spring 
 that 's a lot of <unk> as it turns out 
 cfcs are the primary <unk> in a gas often referred to by the du pont trade name <unk> which is <unk> to liquid form to serve as the cooling agent in <unk> and <unk> equipment 
 <unk> containing cfcs are pumped into <unk> to make the foam used in <unk> <unk> and <unk> 
 <unk> foam is a highly efficient <unk> which accounts for why the walls of refrigerators and <unk> can be <unk> now than they were back in the days when they were <unk> with glass fiber 
 but even though by some estimates it might cost the world as much as $ N billion between now and the year N to convert to other <unk> <unk> agents and <unk> and to <unk> equipment for these less efficient <unk> the montreal protocol 's <unk> of supporters say it is worth it 
 they insist that cfcs are damaging the earth 's <unk> ozone layer which screens out some of the sun 's <unk> <unk> 
 hence as they see it if something is n't done <unk> will become ever more subject to <unk> and skin cancer 
 peter teagan a specialist in heat transfer is running a project at arthur d. little inc. of cambridge mass. to find alternative technologies that will allow industry to eliminate cfcs 
 in addition to his interest in ozone depletion he has <unk> studied the related topic of global warming a theory that <unk> 's generation of carbon dioxide through increased combustion of fossil fuels is creating a greenhouse effect that will work important <unk> changes in the earth 's atmosphere over time 
 i would be the first to admit that there is not a complete consensus in the scientific community on either one of these problems says mr. teagan 
 in the kind of literature i read i come across <unk> opinions quite frequently 
 but the nature of the problem is such that many others feel it has to be addressed soon before all the evidence is in 
 we ca n't afford to wait 
 but does it have to be so soon 
 some atmospheric scientists think that even if cfcs were released into the atmosphere at an accelerating rate the amount of ozone depletion would be only N N by the middle of the next century 
 it 's easy to get something comparable by simply moving to a higher <unk> in the u.s. 
 moreover there are questions particularly among atmospheric scientists who know this subject best about the ability of anyone to know what in fact is happening to the ozone layer 
 it is generally agreed that when cfcs rise from earth to <unk> the <unk> in them is capable of <unk> with the process through which <unk> <unk> split <unk> <unk> and form ozone 
 but ozone creation is a very large-scale natural process and the importance of <unk> cfcs in reducing it is largely a matter of <unk> 
 the ozone layer is constantly in motion and thus very hard to measure 
 what scientists have known since the late 1970s is that there is a hole in the layer over <unk> that <unk> or contracts from year to year 
 but it is at least worthy of some note that there are very few refrigerators in <unk> 
 moreover surely someone has noticed that household refrigerators are closed systems running for many years without either the <unk> gas or the <unk> ever <unk> 
 another argument of the environmentalists is that if <unk> are available why not use them 
 mr. teagan cites a list of <unk> but none so far match the <unk> <unk> cfcs 
 <unk> and propane can be used as <unk> for example but are <unk> 
 moreover new lubricants will be needed to protect <unk> from the new <unk> which as with cfcs are <unk> 
 mr. teagan points out as well that if the equipment designed to get along without cfcs is less efficient than current devices energy consumption will rise and that will worsen the greenhouse effect 
 folks in the midwest who just suffered a mid-october <unk> may wonder where the greenhouse was when they needed it but let 's not be <unk> about grave risks 
 as it happens arthur d. little is not at all interested in throwing cold water on ozone depletion and global warming theories 
 it is interested in making some money advising industry on how to convert to a world without cfcs 
 there is after all big money in environmentalism 
 maybe we should ask why it was that du pont so quickly <unk> and issued a statement giving it wide publicity that it was <unk> cfcs 
 <unk> introduced in N <unk> america by making <unk> and air <unk> practical after all 
 one answer is that big companies are growing <unk> of fighting environmental movements and are trying instead to cash in on them although they never care to put it quite that way 
 du pont as it happens has a potential substitute for cfcs 
 imperial chemical industries of the u.k. also has one and is building a plant in louisiana to produce it 
 japanese chemical companies are at work developing their own <unk> and hoping to <unk> new markets of course 
 there are still others who do n't mind seeing new crises arise 
 environmental groups would soon go out of business were they not able to send out <unk> describing the latest threat and asking for money to fight it 
 university professors and consultants with scientific credentials saw a huge market for their services <unk> when price <unk> destroyed the energy crisis and thus the demand for alternative energy 
 they needed new crises to generate new grants and contracts 
 in other words environmentalism has created a whole set of vested interests that fare better when there are many problems than when there are few 
 that tends to tilt the public debate toward solutions even when some of the most knowledgeable scientists are skeptical about the <unk> of the threats and the insistence of urgency 
 there is an element of <unk> involved 
 consumers pay the bill for all this in the price of a <unk> or an <unk> car 
 if they were really getting insurance against environmental disaster the price would be cheap 
 but if there is no impending threat it can get to be very expensive 
 but worries about N 
 with most legislatures <unk> for the year small business is <unk> its <unk> 
 much of its attention was spent fighting organized labor 's initiatives on issues the small-business community traditionally opposes from raising state minimum wage levels to <unk> benefits in health plans 
 while results were mixed in many states small business got by fairly well concludes don l. robinson associate director of the national federation of independent business the largest small-business organization 
 five states oregon <unk> island new hampshire iowa and wisconsin passed bills to boost the minimum wage but measures in N other states were defeated 
 oregon 's rate will rise to $ N an hour the nation 's highest in jan. N N 
 iowa 's will be the second highest at $ N an hour in january N but small-business lobbyists won an exclusion for tiny concerns and a lower training rate 
 in N central states one small-business count shows lawmakers adopted only three of N bills <unk> health coverage or parental leave 
 the illinois legislature narrowly passed a <unk> bill which gov. james thompson vetoed and iowa and tennessee amended laws to require that employers pay for <unk> <unk> 
 small business is bracing for an <unk> of similar proposals next year 
 those kinds of issues always keep coming back says robert <unk> who manages the illinois chamber of commerce 's small-business office 
 despite victories this year small business fears losing <unk> war 
 only two states vermont and washington this year joined five others requiring private employers to grant leaves of absence to employees with <unk> or adopted <unk> 
 similar proposals were defeated in at least N other states 
 but small business which generally <unk> <unk> benefits has taken note of the growing number of close votes 
 it 's just a matter of time before the tide turns says one midwestern lobbyist 
 consequently small business is taking more <unk> steps to counter mandated leaves 
 in pennsylvania small businesses are pushing for a voluntary alternative they favor a commission that would develop sample leave policies that employers could adopt 
 they also support a tax credit for employers to offset the cost of hiring and training workers who temporarily replace employees on parental leave 
 in N the issue is expected to be especially close in alaska california michigan new york pennsylvania and illinois 
 we 'll be playing a lot of defense especially in the midwest and northeast says jim <unk> of the <unk> 
 in los angeles more small businesses <unk> adopting a child-care policy 
 triggering the <unk> is a recent city council decision to give preference in letting city contracts to suppliers with a stated policy on child care for their employees 
 the <unk> treatment even applies to <unk> small contracts under $ N and consulting and temporary services which often go to the smaller concerns 
 firms are permitted wide flexibility in the child-care arrangements they provide 
 council member <unk> <unk> the measure 's chief advocate considers it part of a <unk> policy that makes los angeles a leader in <unk> the workplace

 with some new rules state officials say they made it easier and faster to sell new <unk> whose terms <unk> from those in <unk> contracts 
 previously regulators insisted that franchisers <unk> such changes with the state a costly process taking at least six weeks 
 now some negotiated sales that meet a series of tests do n't have to be <unk> 
 for instance franchisers no longer must <unk> sales to <unk> franchisees who qualify as sophisticated purchasers 
 such buyers must have a minimum net worth of $ N million $ N annual income or recent experience in the business area of the franchise being sold 
 but critics consider the changes <unk> 
 lewis g. <unk> a chicago lawyer who represents franchisers contends california is narrowly limiting rather than expanding opportunities for negotiating sales 
 he argues california regulators historically have <unk> their law and he says negotiated sales that are n't <unk> have been legal all along

 about N commuters trying to find their way through the bay area 's <unk> transportation system <unk> <unk> into <unk> sat in traffic <unk> on major freeways or waited <unk> for buses yesterday 
 in other words it was a <unk> manhattan commute 
 city officials feared widespread gridlock on the first day that normal business operations were resumed following last tuesday 's earthquake 
 the massive temblor which killed at least N people <unk> the bay bridge a major artery to the east and closed most <unk> leading to and from highway N the biggest artery to the south 
 it will take several weeks to repair the bridge and several months to repair some of the N connections 
 but in spite of a <unk> <unk> gridlock never materialized mainly because the bay area rapid transit subway system carried N N more passengers than normal 
 for the first time in memory it was <unk> only in bart 's <unk> modern <unk> 
 moreover the two main bridges still connecting san francisco with the east bay did n't charge <unk> allowing traffic to zip through without <unk> 
 officials also suspect that traffic benefited from steps by major employers to get workers to come in at odd hours or that many workers are still staying at home 
 many commuters who normally drove across the bay bridge which is shut down for several weeks because of damage to one span actually may have reached work a bit faster on bart yesterday provided they could find a parking space at the system 's <unk> stations 
 in the best of times the bay bridge is the worst commute in the region often experiencing <unk> of N to N minutes or more 
 not that getting into town was easy 
 storm flooding caused <unk> on the freeway and many commuters had to find <unk> to bart 's stations because parking lots were full before <unk> 
 bus schedules were sometimes in disarray <unk> commuters such as <unk> sullivan 
 her commute from <unk> calif. normally takes an hour and N minutes via the golden gate bridge which <unk> san francisco with the north bay area 
 yesterday she was still waiting at a bus stop after three hours trying to transfer to a bus going to the financial district 
 it 's worse than i thought she said 
 i do n't know where all the buses are 
 but while traffic was heavy early in the commute over the golden gate by N a.m. it already had <unk> out 
 it 's one of the <unk> <unk> i 've ever had said charles <unk> an insurance broker on the bus from mill valley in <unk> county 
 it looks like a holiday 
 i think a lot of people got scared and stayed home 
 however a spokeswoman for bankamerica corp. said yesterday 's <unk> at the bank holding company was no greater than on an average day 
 at the san mateo bridge which <unk> the san francisco peninsula with the east bay police were surprised at the speed with which traffic moved 
 everybody pretty much pitched in and <unk> said <unk> <unk> a <unk> with the california highway <unk> 
 there were many indications that the new work hours implemented by major corporations played a big role 
 the golden gate handled as many cars as normally yesterday but over four hours rather than the usual <unk> crush 
 <unk> group inc. the giant closely held engineering concern says it has instituted a N a.m. to N p.m. <unk> arrangement <unk> employees may select any <unk> period during those hours to go to work 
 of <unk> 's N employees about N work in san francisco one-third of them <unk> from <unk> east bay 
 pacific gas & electric co. is offering its N san francisco employees a two-tier <unk> schedule either N a.m. to N p.m. or N a.m. to N p.m 
 the <unk> may cut by almost a third the number of <unk> employees working conventional N hours a spokesman says 
 some of the utility 's employees may <unk> for a four-day <unk> N hours a day to cut the commute by N N 
 at pacific telesis group <unk> is left up to individual working groups because some of the telephone company 's employees must be on-site during normal business hours a spokeswoman says 
 some individuals went to some <unk> on their own to avoid the anticipated gridlock 
 one senior vice president at <unk> said he got up at N a.m. to drive into san francisco from the east bay 
 but transportation officials worry that such extraordinary measures and cooperation may not last 
 although one transportation official said drivers who did n't use car pools were committing an <unk> act about two-thirds of the <unk> crossing the golden gate were alone compared with the normal N N rate 
 and some commuters relieved by the absence of gridlock were planning to return to their old ways 
 <unk> kasparov went to combat sunday with the world 's most advanced <unk> computer and kicked it around <unk> anyway like an old <unk> can 
 playing black in the first game the human champion <unk> deep thought known for its attacking <unk> into a totally passive position 
 then he <unk> his own <unk> attack 
 and in the second game with mr. kasparov advancing <unk> as white d.t. offered <unk> resistance and lost even faster 
 well <unk> can rest easier for now 
 though almost everybody at the playing site had been looking for the <unk> soviet to beat the <unk> computer he gave the machine a far worse <unk> than many expected 
 and when mr. kasparov <unk> into the playing hall he called the outcome 
 as if he were iron mike about to enter the ring with a <unk> <unk> he declared i 'll be able to beat any computer for the next five years 
 his strategy against d.t. was based on a <unk> study of dozens of its games he said including its notorious <unk> of the <unk> <unk> larsen of <unk> and robert <unk> of the u.s. 
 mr. kasparov was <unk> 
 the computer 's mind is too straight too <unk> lacking the <unk> and creativity needed to reach the top he said 
 the champion apparently was not worried at all about d.t. 's strong points 
 its chief <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> his <unk> the <unk> for its tactical <unk> at <unk> out of horrible positions 
 d.t. also has a <unk> and <unk> memory is utterly <unk> and could n't be <unk> by the <unk> <unk> <unk> spread around the playing hall in the new york academy of art 
 in fact d.t. never left home <unk> mellon university in pittsburgh but <unk> with its human <unk> by telephone link 
 they conceded that the odds favored mr. kasparov but they put their hope in d.t. 's recently enhanced capacity for <unk> positions up to a million per second from N 
 but the <unk> mistakenly stuck with silicon chips they needed <unk> 
 this became apparent as game one a <unk> defense by mr. kasparov <unk> 
 no human can examine millions of moves but mr. kasparov using his <unk> powerful brain consistently found very good ones 
 after eight moves by each side the board was the same as in a game in which nigel short of great britain fought the champion to a draw in N 
 but the computer did n't play mr. short 's ninth move a key pawn thrust and its position deteriorated rapidly 
 instead of <unk> a standard measure to <unk> the king d.t. made a <unk> <unk> maneuver at move N then it put a knight <unk> on move N 
 only two classes of minds would think of this very weak human players and computers said <unk> <unk> the expert <unk> for the match which was attended by hundreds of <unk> fans 
 by move N d.t. had fallen into a deep <unk> trap 
 it allowed mr. kasparov to exchange his <unk> <unk> for one of d.t. 's <unk> 
 <unk> usually are worth slightly more than <unk> but in this case mr. kasparov was left with a very dangerous knight and d.t. 's surviving <unk> was reduced to <unk> 
 indeed it looked more like a pawn a tall pawn as <unk> <unk> put it 
 consistently d.t. was <unk> about its chances which it continually <unk> up in <unk> form 
 when most <unk> thought its position <unk> the computer thought it was only in effect one-half of a pawn down 
 such <unk> met with <unk> and kept the machine from resigning as soon as humans would have prompting more <unk> 
 while d.t. <unk> its king back and forth in a defensive <unk> mr. kasparov <unk> the knight to a dominant <unk> 
 he also launched a <unk> storm <unk> a pawn to <unk> d.t. 's king 
 no amount of <unk> could have saved this game for <unk> 
 a piece down the computer resigned 
 now with the crowd in the analysis room <unk> <unk> blood the only question seemed to be how fast mr. kasparov could win game two 
 with the advantage of playing white which moves first mr. kasparov followed up <unk> against the computer 's defense a queen 's <unk> accepted 
 as early as move six mr. kasparov <unk> from a well-known <unk> of moves developing a knight instead of making a standard <unk> attack against the computer 's advanced knight 
 this left the computer with a broader range of <unk> replies and it immediately <unk> by moving a <unk> pawn to the <unk> of <unk> development 
 in a new position just after the opening a computer will have serious problems mr. kasparov said later 
 in such positions he explained you have to create something new and the computer is n't able to do that right now 
 after only N moves for each side the computer 's position was shaky 
 <unk> it grabbed a pawn at the cost of facing a <unk> attack 
 and when a defensive move was called for d.t. passed up an obvious pawn move and instead exposed its queen to immediate tactical threats 
 mr. kasparov <unk> later that even a weak club player would have avoided the queen move 
 now after only a dozen moves <unk> were looking for a <unk> combination 
 on a demonstration board <unk> <unk> <unk> showed a quick kill initiated by a knight sacrifice no <unk> <unk> this line of play 
 mr. kasparov 's <unk> was slower but in the end just as deadly 
 he won d.t. 's queen for two minor pieces and two <unk> not enough compensation in this position to give the computer much hope 
 in a <unk> position the computer resigned rather than make its <unk> move 
 and mr. kasparov to <unk> and applause marched back into the analysis room 
 in both games i got exactly what i wanted he said 
 what he had demonstrated he added is that there 's more to <unk> than sheer <unk> 
 <unk> d.t. 's <unk> vowed to press on 
 indeed three of them will be building a successor machine for international business machines corp 
 promises <unk> <unk> in three years we 'll mount a better challenge 
 mr. <unk> is a reporter in the journal 's new york bureau 
 reaching for that extra bit of yield can be a big mistake especially if you do n't understand what you 're investing in 
 just ask richard blumenfeld a new jersey <unk> who considers himself a reasonably sophisticated investor 
 in may N dr. blumenfeld gave merrill lynch & co. about $ N for a federally insured certificate of deposit offering an effective yield of more than N N 
 it was a time when interest rates came down very rapidly dr. blumenfeld recalls 
 yields on five-year cds at major banks were averaging about N N and 10-year treasury notes were paying less than N N 
 the cd seemed like a great deal 
 but nearly N N years later merrill says the investment is worth about $ N an amount that represents an annual return of just over N N on dr. blumenfeld 's $ N 
 the problem is that the cd he bought for a retirement plan was n't a plain <unk> cd 
 instead his merrill broker put him in a zero-coupon cd which is sold at a deep discount to its face value 
 the difference between the price and the face value payable at maturity is the investor 's return 
 more important the cd was purchased on the secondary or resale market 
 because the cd had an effective yield of N N when it was issued in N and interest rates in general had declined sharply since then part of the price dr. blumenfeld paid was a premium an additional amount on top of the cd 's base value plus accrued interest that represented the cd 's increased market value 
 now the thrift that issued the cd is insolvent and dr. blumenfeld has learned to his surprise that the premium is n't insured under federal deposit insurance 
 the <unk> came when he opened a recent merrill lynch statement and found that the cd 's estimated current market value had plummeted by $ N in a month 
 several phone calls and a visit to his broker 's office later the <unk> found out that the $ N drop represented the current value of the premium he paid when he bought the cd and that the amount was n't insured 
 this is one thing i was never aware of he says 
 he assumed that principal and interest were fully insured up to $ N he adds 
 dr. blumenfeld is n't unique 
 especially at times like these when declining rates make it hard for investors to get yields they have come to expect too many people chase the promise of <unk> returns without fully <unk> the risk 
 yield greed often gets in the way of understanding things says john <unk> research director of the american association of individual investors a chicago-based educational group 
 the biggest problem we have is that investors realize after the fact that they did n't understand what they were investing in 
 dr. blumenfeld concedes he did n't fully understand what he was buying 
 he says that he knew he was getting a zero-coupon cd and that he had previously invested in <unk> treasury income growth receipts a type of zero-coupon treasury security sold by merrill lynch 
 but he says he did n't understand he was buying the cd on the secondary market and he contends his broker never fully explained the risks 
 the broker thomas <unk> of merrill lynch 's morristown n.j. office refuses to discuss the matter with a reporter referring inquiries to merrill lynch officials in new york 
 those officials say there was full disclosure of the risks in a fact sheet sent to all cd investors with their confirmation of sale 
 the fact sheet dated april N says on page three if the price paid for a cd purchased in the secondary market is higher than the <unk> value in the case of zero-coupon cds the difference is not insured 
 <unk> involving zero-coupon cds are more complicated and you should discuss any questions you may have with your financial consultant 
 dr. blumenfeld says he does n't remember the <unk> about premiums in the fact sheet he received and did n't realize part of what he paid was a premium 
 i assumed i was buying a cd as a cd he says 
 nevertheless merrill lynch has agreed that if the thrift that issued dr. blumenfeld 's cd peoples heritage federal savings & loan association in <unk> kan. is liquidated and the cd terminated the brokerage firm would cover the premium dr. blumenfeld paid 
 federal deposit insurance would pay principal and interest accrued to the date of liquidation to a maximum of $ N 
 it 's not a blanket commitment it 's a <unk> situation says albert <unk> a managing director of merrill lynch money markets inc 
 there 's a question whether brokers at the time were fully aware of the risks 
 we were n't sure that full disclosure as we wanted it was being made 
 merrill lynch says it 's impossible to estimate how many investors are in dr. blumenfeld 's situation although it says the firm has received only one other complaint about premiums on the secondary market in three years 
 merrill lynch now provides credit rating information about the institutions whose cds it sells which it did n't provide in N 
 zero-coupon cds are only a small portion of the $ N <unk> in cds outstanding and those purchased on the secondary market are an even smaller part of the total 
 merrill lynch estimates that fewer than N financial institutions currently issue zero-coupon cds 
 still there are several billion dollars of zero-coupon cds with various maturities outstanding 
 because of the tax consequences of zero-coupon investments income tax is payable in the year interest is accrued although interest is n't actually paid until maturity zero-coupon cds are usually sold for <unk> accounts to finance things like retirement and children 's education 
 most zero-coupon cds are in maturities of six to nine years and they usually double in value by maturity 
 but investors who bought zero-coupon cds in the secondary market are n't the only ones who may be surprised to learn the full amount of their investments is n't insured 
 people who paid a premium for standard cds purchased on the secondary market could also find that those premiums are n't insured if the institutions that issued the cds failed 
 however those premiums are usually far smaller than on zero-coupon cds and the simpler pricing structure of a standard cd makes it more apparent when a premium is paid 
 whatever the case a merrill lynch spokesman <unk> investors should n't have to worry about the uninsured premium issue unless the bank or thrift that issued the cd is closed and its deposits paid off before maturity or transferred to another institution at a lower rate 
 dr. blumenfeld says he 's satisfied that his problem has been resolved 
 and he says he 's learned a lesson you always have to watch out for yourself 
 no one else will watch out for you

 but sales for u.s. franchisees were flat at best on a <unk> basis despite weak N figures 
 compared with the first nine months of last year average franchisee store sales this year were down nearly $ N reflecting a fierce discounting war among fast-food chains 
 since mcdonald 's <unk> prices rose this year the actual decline may have been more 
 mcdonald 's closed at $ N up $ N in new york stock exchange composite trading yesterday 
 while franchisees were having a tough time holding sales mcdonald 's <unk> stores posted hefty gains for the nine months with sales per <unk> unit rising $ N 
 one analyst noted that the company often has better store locations than do its franchisees thus <unk> promotional efforts

 there are more than three times as many <unk> domestic outlets as there are company stores 
 profit margins at u.s. company-owned stores in the quarter were up nearly N N which the company attributed in part to lower food costs

 carnival cruise lines inc. 's common stock was dragged down yesterday amid concerns that a bankruptcy filing by a finnish <unk> would delay delivery of three big cruise ships 
 the miami-based company 's stock fell $ N yesterday to $ N a share in heavy american stock exchange composite trading 
 early yesterday carnival said in a company statement that it had been notified <unk> that waertsilae marine industries the finnish shipyard that is building its three new cruise ships planned to file for bankruptcy 
 officials at carnival declined to comment 
 there is just a tremendous amount of uncertainty about what the effect if any of all this is said john p. <unk> an analyst at raymond james associates inc 
 i did n't even know that a company in a <unk> country could file for bankruptcy 
 carnival said the fantasy the first of the three $ N million ships that carnival has on order is scheduled to be delivered next month just in time for the winter tourist season in the caribbean 
 that ship which would carry about N passengers would expand the capacity of carnival 's existing <unk> fleet by N N 
 the second ship which is <unk> is scheduled to be delivered in fall N and the third in fall N 
 there 's a N N chance that the fantasy will be delivered close to schedule said <unk> levy an analyst at shearson lehman hutton inc 
 the others will probably be delivered as well but carnival will likely have to pay a higher price for them 
 she said the company could pay as much as N N more for the ships 
 if the ships are n't delivered however it will likely have an effect on the company 's earnings as soon as the N fiscal year which begins dec. N 
 analysts said those estimates which range from about $ N a share to $ N a share are based on fantasy being in operation in N 
 if the ship fails to arrive those per-share earnings estimates could be trimmed N cents or more 
 analysts were n't willing to speculate on how much money carnival might lose through deposits 
 normally a company pays a portion of the total cost of a ship as it reaches various stages of construction 
 carnival for example has already paid about $ N million of the total cost for fantasy 
 some analysts say this may give it the right to seize the ship if the situation warrants it 
 according to reports from finland waertsilae marine <unk> by conglomerate oy waertsilae filed for bankruptcy yesterday after the shipyard 's contractors had started to demand bank guarantees

 ms. garratt was the subject of a wall street journal article in march 
 the designer 's attorney <unk> <unk> said that ms. garratt was forced to start bankruptcy-law proceedings because <unk> began <unk> her royalty payments last month 
 <unk> paid ms. garratt royalties for the line known as multiples by <unk> garratt which are sold primarily through department stores 
 ms. garratt sued the dallas apparel maker earlier this year charging that <unk> developed and marketed clothing lines <unk> after her designs in violation of their contract 
 that lawsuit is still pending

 ms. garratt 's assets and liabilities were n't disclosed 
 eaton corp. had a N N drop in third-quarter profit mainly because of lower sales of truck parts its largest and most profitable single business 
 sales of medium and <unk> trucks continue to lag <unk> rates leading eaton to expect fourth-quarter net income to fall below year-earlier levels said stephen r. <unk> vice chairman and chief financial and administrative officer 
 he declined to make a specific earnings estimate 
 third-quarter net was $ N million or $ N a share from $ N million or $ N a share a year ago 
 sales rose N N to $ N million from $ N million 
 the quarter net was below analyst expectations mainly because <unk> sales did n't rebound in september from the summer doldrums as they usually do said patrick e. <unk> analyst with mcdonald & co 
 mr. <unk> who had been expecting quarter profit of about $ N a share says he is reducing his estimate for the year to the area of $ N a share from his previous estimate of $ N 
 eli <unk> of painewebber inc. who a couple of weeks ago reduced his N estimate to $ N a share because of the weakening truck market says he will make another cut to about $ N a share in light of the third-quarter report 
 he said eaton 's quarter profit margin on controls was lower than he anticipated 
 eaton said sales of truck <unk> <unk> and other parts fell N N to $ N million 
 sales of parts for cars and construction vehicles rose 
 eaton does n't provide profit figures separately for each category but operating profit for vehicle parts as a group fell N N to $ N million on an about N N drop in sales to $ N million 
 mr. <unk> said <unk> operators appear to be cautious about buying new trucks until they see how the economy <unk> 
 the truck sales slowdown reflects the general slowing in sales of consumer goods he said and the latest reports show a slight improvement rather than any indication of a downward <unk> 
 operating profit from electrical and electronics controls eaton 's other major business group fell N N to $ N million despite a N N increase in sales to $ N million 
 the company attributed the decline to weakness in the <unk> market in north america and in the european <unk> market 
 for the nine months net including profit from discontinued operations both years and in N an extraordinary charge of $ N million related to settlement of a lawsuit was $ N million or $ N a share up N N from $ N million or $ N a share a year ago 
 eaton earned from continuing operations $ N million or $ N a share down N N from $ N million or $ N a share a year earlier 
 nine-month sales were $ N billion up N N from $ N billion a year earlier

 in poland 's rapid shift from socialism to an <unk> alternative environmental issues have become a cutting edge of broader movements to restructure the economy cut <unk> <unk> and <unk> local politics 
 initial steps were taken at poland 's first international environmental conference which i attended last month 
 the conference held in lower <unk> was <unk> by the environment ministry the rockefeller brothers fund and the polish ecological club and was attended by N poles from government and industry as well as <unk> <unk> russians japanese and americans 
 the conference was entitled economic <unk> for environmental protection a significant departure from east bloc usage which recognizes only one economic mechanism central planning to direct industrial behavior 
 even more <unk> it focused on emissions trading and similar market approaches to address pollution notwithstanding poland 's lack of <unk> markets 
 why did east bloc participants unanimously <unk> <unk> pollution approaches 
 the answer lies both in the <unk> environment of these countries and the perceived causes of that <unk> 
 like other east bloc countries poland <unk> environmental laws more <unk> in their breach than in their <unk> 
 according to a detailed report by <unk> <unk> of the university of minnesota 's <unk> <unk> institute N areas containing a third of poland 's population are regarded as ecological hazards due to multiple violations of standards 
 <unk> are consistently exceeded at N N of <unk> <unk> monitoring sites and N N of those for dust and <unk> emissions 
 <unk> of poland 's <unk> have become highly <unk> N N of its southern <unk> are projected to die by century 's end 
 between N and N polish waters fit for human consumption dropped from N N to N N of all surface waters while those <unk> even for industry use nearly doubled 
 poland produces about N times more <unk> and five times more <unk> dioxide and solid waste per unit of gross national product than does western europe 
 its mortality rate for males over N is about N N higher than west germany 's and N N higher in hazard areas than the national average 
 since N average annual growth rates for most <unk> have <unk> the growth of gnp 
 conference participants saw these effects as flowing directly from a marxist devaluation of environmental resources which are not produced by labor b planned economies ' inability to control pollution where enterprises are state-owned and penalties are paid by the government and c the continuing <unk> emphasis on heavy industry for economic development producing a far heavier and more <unk> use of energy and natural resources than in the west 
 they repeatedly noted that environmental progress could not be secured without true ownership genuine competition based on market factors and the risk of bankruptcy if a business makes the wrong decisions 
 the solutions they formally proposed included <unk> taxes conservation and recycling incentives <unk> <unk> <unk> pollution permits an ecological bank to finance <unk> credits and <unk> swaps 
 but their most fundamental recommendation was to separate industry from the state making it fully <unk> for pollution control 
 a revolution takes more than conference <unk> 
 indeed skepticism was <unk> captured by a joke told by poles at the conference the world must be coming to an end 
 the russians are talking peace 
 the <unk> are talking elections 
 and the poles are engaged in commerce 
 but the implications of such a shift to market approaches go well beyond the fact that poland is already working on nationwide emissions trades to reduce <unk> pollution or that the soviets plan to introduce <unk> pollution permits in some republics next year 
 those implications include privatization 
 faced with a $ N billion foreign debt and <unk> inflation poland must <unk> industry and eliminate subsidies to stabilize its currency and qualify for international assistance 
 <unk> pollution control may consume some capital that would otherwise purchase state industries 
 but it could also accelerate <unk> by reinforcing industrial accountability breaking up state monopolies giving managers a stake in solutions and ensuring that modernization is not <unk> for failure to address environmental effects 
 <unk> solutions 
 as conferees noted scarce capital means the costs of control must be <unk> through a broad <unk> of compliance choices for individual firms 
 that means simple clear rules that secure the first large blocks of reduction deferring more complex issues such as risk 
 it also means use of <unk> pollution limits such as <unk> permits rather than <unk> limits such as <unk> fees 
 that 's because <unk> managers will likely respond better to quantity than to price signals 
 creative financing 
 even <unk> environmental solutions will require billions of dollars 
 new types of financing must make funds available without <unk> poland 's <unk> reserves 
 <unk> 
 east bloc pollution data typically have been state secrets 
 while polish data have been freely available since N it was no accident that participants urged the free flow of information 
 for once information flows public participation follows and repression becomes difficult to <unk> 
 global <unk> 
 one participant <unk> declared that america has had a free market in goods but a planned economy for environmental protection while poland represents the opposite 
 his point it will be increasingly difficult for the u.s. to <unk> to <unk> measures if even the east bloc steps to a different <unk> 
 at the moment poland resembles <unk> pittsburgh more than a modern industrial society with <unk> production inadequate environmental management and little ecological awareness 
 but the continuing pressures for free-market economics suggest the conference 's vision was not all fantasy 
 mr. <unk> former head of epa 's regulatory reform staff adapted this from his november column for the journal of the air and waste management association 
 disappointing earnings news from some technology companies <unk> investors in the over-the-counter market who sold shares of apple computer intel and many other <unk> concerns 
 the drop in those and other technology stocks contributed to an N N slide by the nasdaq composite index 
 it finished at N down N 
 the nervousness about the technology stock outlook also hurt the dow jones industrial average which slipped about N N 
 mostly because of the sell-off in technology stocks the nasdaq N index of the otc 's largest <unk> issues dropped N to N 
 the nasdaq financial index of giant insurance and banking issues lost N to N 
 some traders said the sell-off of technology stocks on low volume reflected a lack of conviction by investors 
 but charlie <unk> vice president in charge of otc trading at <unk> financial in stamford conn. said the selling was orderly 
 it 's a quiet retreat said mr. <unk> 
 it 's nothing dramatic just a routine sell-off 
 some of it was due to lower-than-expected earnings from leading companies he said 
 but some of it also represented profit-taking by investors who have made big gains in some issues

 that would be good news for the otc market some analysts say because many small growth stocks are traded there 
 michael r. <unk> partner in charge of research at robertson <unk> & co. in san francisco said some investors have already made the switch

 why ca n't we teach our children to read write and <unk> 
 it 's not that we do n't know how to because we do 
 it 's that we do n't want to 
 and the reason we do n't want to is that effective education would require us to <unk> some <unk> <unk> <unk> about human nature in general and the human nature of young people in particular as well as to violate some <unk> vested interests 
 these <unk> so dominate our educational establishment our media our politicians and even our parents that it seems almost <unk> to challenge them 
 here is an example 
 if i were to ask a sample of american parents do you wish the <unk> schools to encourage creativity in your children the <unk> answer would be yes of course 
 but what do we mean specifically by creativity 
 no one can say 
 in practice it ends up being <unk> with a <unk> that encourages the youngsters ' <unk> 
 the result is a generation of young people whose ignorance and intellectual <unk> is matched only by their good opinion of themselves 
 the whole notion of creativity in education was and is part and parcel of a romantic <unk> against disciplined instruction which was and is regarded as <unk> a repression and frustration of the <unk> <unk> and the wonderful if as yet <unk> <unk> inherent in the <unk> of all our children 
 it is not surprising that parents find this romantic <unk> so attractive 
 fortunately these same parents do want their children to get a decent education as traditionally understood and they have enough common sense to know what that demands 
 their commitment to creativity can not survive <unk> <unk> 
 american education 's future will be determined by the degree to which we all of us allow this common sense to prevail over the <unk> that we also share 
 the education establishment will fight against common sense every inch of the way 
 the reasons are complex but one simple reason ought not to be underestimated 
 <unk> education as it was once called is far more interesting and <unk> to teachers than is disciplined instruction 
 it is nice for teachers to think they are engaged in <unk> development and even <unk> to minimize those <unk> tests with often disappointing results 
 it also provides teachers with a superior <unk> as a profession since they will have passed courses in educational psychology and educational philosophy 
 i myself took such courses in college thinking i might end up a <unk> 
 they could all fairly be described as <unk> courses 
 but it is unfair to dump on teachers as distinct from the educational establishment 
 i know many <unk> and on the whole they are seriously committed to <unk> teaching 
 they may not be among the best and <unk> of their generation there are very few such people by definition 
 but they need not be to do their jobs well 
 yes we all can remember one or two truly <unk> teachers from our school days 
 but our education <unk> at the hands of those others who were merely competent and <unk> 
 in this sense a teacher can be compared to one 's family doctor 
 if he were brilliant he probably would not be a family doctor in the first place 
 if he is competent and <unk> he serves us well 
 our teachers are not an important factor in our educational crisis 
 whether they are or are not <unk> is a problem of equity it is not an educational problem 
 it is silly libel on our teachers to think they would educate our children better if only they got a few thousand dollars a year more 
 it is the kind of libel the teachers ' unions do n't mind spreading for their own narrow purposes 
 it is also the kind of libel politicians find useful since it helps them strike a friendly posture on behalf of an important constituency 
 but there is not one <unk> of evidence that other things being equal salary <unk> result in educational <unk> 
 if there were such evidence you can be sure you would have heard of it 
 if we wish to be serious about american education we know exactly what to do and just as important what not to do 
 there are many successful schools scattered throughout this nation some of them in the poorest of <unk> and they are all sending us the same message 
 <unk> there are the majority of unsuccessful schools and we know which efforts at educational reform are doomed <unk> 
 we really do know all we need to know if only we could <unk> this knowledge into our thinking 
 in this respect it would be helpful if our political leaders were <unk> rather than <unk> concerned 
 they are inevitably inclined to echo the conventional <unk> since this is the least controversial option that is open to them 
 thus at the recent governors ' conference on education gov. bill clinton of arkansas announced that this country needs a comprehensive <unk> policy for children under five 
 a comprehensive development policy for governors over N would seem to be a more pressing need 
 what gov. clinton is <unk> in effect is extending the educational system down to the <unk> years 
 whether desirable or not this is a child-care program not an educational program 
 we know that very early exposure to <unk> improves performance in the first grade but afterward the difference is quickly <unk> away 
 let us sum up what we do know about education and about those education reforms that do work and do n't work parental involvement is a bad idea 
 parents are too likely to blame schools for the educational limitations of their children 
 parents should be involved with their children 's education at home not in school 
 they should see to it that their kids do n't play <unk> they should make certain that the children spend enough time doing <unk> they should <unk> the report card 
 if parents are <unk> with a school they should have the option of switching to another 
 community involvement is an even worse idea 
 here the experience of new york city is decisive 
 locally elected school boards especially in our larger cities become the <unk> of ambitious generally corrupt and invariably <unk> local politicians or would-be politicians 
 new york is in the process of trying to <unk> itself from a <unk> commitment to this system of school <unk> even as chicago and other cities are moving to institute it 
 in most states increasing expenditures on education in our current circumstances will probably make things worse not better 
 the reason is simple education takes place in the classroom where the influence of money is minimal 
 decades of educational research tell us <unk> that even smaller classes have zero effect on the academic performance of the <unk> though they may sometimes be desirable for other reasons 
 the new money flows into the already <unk> administrative structure which <unk> itself <unk> more and more paper work on the teachers 
 there is neither mystery nor <unk> in the fact that as educational expenditures in real terms have increased sharply in the past <unk> we now spend more per <unk> than any other country in the world educational performance has declined 
 that is the way the system works 
 students should move up the educational <unk> as their academic potential allows 
 no student should be permitted to be <unk> from <unk> school without having <unk> the N r 's at the level that prevailed N years ago 
 this means tracking whose main purpose is less to permit the <unk> youngsters to <unk> though that is clearly desirable than to ensure that the less <unk> get the necessary <unk> for further study or for entering the modern world of work 
 the notion that tracking is somehow <unk> is absurd 
 the purpose of education is to encourage young men and women to realize their full academic potential 
 no one in his right mind actually believes that we all have an equal academic potential 
 it is generally desirable to use older <unk> many of them <unk> out of print rather than newer ones 
 the latter are <unk> trendy often downright silly and at best <unk> 
 they are based on dubious psychological and <unk> theories rather than on educational experience 
 one of the reasons american students do so poorly in <unk> tests as compared with british french german or japanese students is the influence of the new <unk> on american <unk> and teaching methods 
 anyone who wants to appreciate just how bizarre this situation is with students who ca n't add or <unk> learning the conceptual basis of <unk> theory should read the article by <unk> nelson himself a recent <unk> major at harvard in the november american <unk> 
 most important of all schools should have principals with a large measure of authority over the faculty the <unk> and all matters of student discipline 
 study after study the most recent from the <unk> institution tells us that the best schools are those that are free of outside <unk> and are <unk> by a powerful head 
 with that authority of course goes an <unk> accountability 
 schools that are structured in this way produce students with higher morale and superior academic performance 
 this is a fact though in view of all the <unk> that are <unk> by this fact it is not surprising that one <unk> so little about it

 manufacturers have already spent so heavily on <unk> that they are one of the computer industry 's leading revenue sources 
 but many manufacturers find that communication between different computers has been <unk> nearly impossible by the <unk> of computer <unk> used by different machines including robots and machine tools 
 ibm 's announcement which was expected and will formally be made to customers today also marks an attempt to gain credibility on the plant floor where digital equipment corp. has long dominated and where hewlett-packard co. has recently gained market share 
 consultants have said that it will take a while for all the pieces of the ibm strategy to fall into place even though the specific products ibm unveiled will generally be available by the end of the first quarter 
 sam albert a consultant in <unk> n.y. said that in the past ibm has developed broad software strategies only for problems that crossed industry lines 
 he said he believes ibm 's decision to invest this sort of effort into a single industry showed that it was getting serious about understanding customers ' problems and was n't just selling technology 
 he said he expects ibm to unveil similar strategies for other industries in coming months 
 ibm 's push is also unusual in its approach to marketing 
 rather than just send out marketing people to knock on customers ' doors ibm is making several hundred of its own manufacturing people available to discuss specific needs 
 ibm 's manufacturing staff also will be able to provide software that ibm has developed <unk> and will be able to form teams with a customer to jointly solve manufacturing problems 
 ibm can obviously bring its expertise to bear on problems related to computer manufacturing but it could also help customers on software to deal with such things as changes in engineering documents 
 we may not have every manufacturing problem but we have most said george <unk> ibm 's top marketing official

 the tougher new regulations under the savings-and-loan bailout law are accelerating the thrift industry 's shrinking act 
 largely to meet tougher new capital requirements thrifts reduced their assets $ N billion in august by selling such assets as mortgage-backed securities and loans 
 industry assets as of aug. N were $ N trillion the lowest since august N 
 as thrifts sell assets to improve their <unk> ratio as required under the new law passed in august they must also reduce liabilities such as deposits 
 as interest rates paid <unk> were lowered thrift withdrawals exceeded deposits by $ N billion not including interest credited to accounts 
 it was the third consecutive month in which thrifts shed assets to increase the size of their capital in <unk> to their assets the office of thrift supervision said 
 the asset <unk> was particularly concentrated in several large california institutions 
 the <unk> of the thrift industry is well under way said <unk> <unk> an industry consultant in <unk> va 
 this suggests the bailout law is having a more dramatic effect than anyone would have <unk> so soon 
 james <unk> an economist with the office of thrift supervision also attributed some of the <unk> to seasonal factors 
 august is a month when people are paying school tuition he said 
 that and adjustment to the new law were the biggest factors in the industry 
 not including thrifts under government conservatorship s&ls reduced their assets by $ N billion from the previous month and deposit outflows totaled $ N billion 
 for the N insolvent thrifts under government management at the end of august assets declined by $ N billion and withdrawals exceeded deposits by $ N billion 
 thrifts raised capital mostly by selling mortgages and mortgage-backed securities which were reduced by $ N billion in august from the prior month 
 as of aug. N thrifts held $ N billion in mortgage-backed securities 
 the deposit numbers for august marked a swing back to huge outflows after a july net deposit <unk> of $ N million the only net <unk> in more than a year 
 deposits are n't expected to exceed withdrawals in the foreseeable future as the industry continues to shrink 
 i think we are going to see deposit <unk> continue unless we see big changes in rates mr. <unk> said 
 for the first eight months of N thrifts ' withdrawals exceeded deposits by $ N billion 
 for the prior year deposits exceeded withdrawals by $ N billion 
 the estimates of real gross national product prepared by the bureau of economic analysis in the department of commerce significantly <unk> the rate of economic growth 
 since the bureau 's estimates for the business sector provide the <unk> for the productivity ratios calculated by the department of labor underestimated growth rates artificially depress official productivity statistics 
 if this <unk> is correct it has important implications for <unk> policies it may lower the sense of urgency behind efforts to enact tax incentives and other measures to increase the rate of growth in productivity and real gnp 
 it would also affect the perceptions of the board of governors of the federal reserve system and the informed public generally as to what <unk> a reasonable degree of price stability 
 in the early 1980s i predicted a significant acceleration in productivity growth over the rest of the decade 
 this forecast was based on the apparent reversal of most of the negative forces such as <unk> changes the oil shock and accelerating inflation that had reduced productivity gains in the 1970s 
 there has indeed been more than a one percentage point improvement in productivity growth since N 
 but i had expected more which is one reason i began looking at evidence suggesting defects in the official output estimates 
 the evidence does not clearly support the view that the downward bias in output growth has become greater during the N period but all i am claiming is that the growth trend is <unk> 
 it is however possible that further study will reveal increasing bias 
 this bias is in no way <unk> 
 the <unk> of growth is due largely to the conservative <unk> adopted to deal with deficiencies in basic economic data 
 the first of three major sources of error is the use of labor input estimates mainly employment or hours instead of output estimates for those sectors such as governments paid household services and private <unk> institutions where there are difficulties in <unk> output data 
 this means that no allowance is made for possible increases in output per unit of labor 
 in an unrelated program in which the labor department does estimate output per employee for more than two-thirds of federal civilian employees it found an average annual rate of productivity improvement of N N during the 1980s 
 even if it is assumed that productivity rose no more than half as quickly in the rest of the <unk> sector this labor department estimate indicates a downward bias in the real gnp estimates of N percentage point a year on average 
 the federal productivity <unk> use labor input rather than output data for their calculations of half of private financial and service industries as well 
 independent estimates of output in those industries including one by the department of labor for banking suggests that productivity in finance and services appears to have risen by an average of at least N N a year between N and N 
 because finance and services contribute N N to final business product missing these productivity improvements <unk> the overall growth rate by N N a year 
 the second source of error in growth statistics is the use of inappropriate <unk> to adjust for price changes 
 i estimate that these <unk> as detailed by martin n. <unk> and robert j. gordon add a further N percentage point to the downward bias in the growth rate of real business product 
 finally the official estimates <unk> growth because they make inadequate allowance for improvements in quality of goods and services 
 in N a new price index for computers adjusted for changes in performance <unk> was introduced and that resulted in a significantly larger increase in real outlays for durable goods than the earlier estimates had showed 
 since then further research argues that failure to take account of quality improvements has contributed a total of at least N percentage point to the downward bias in the growth rate 
 in sum the <unk> <unk> above indicate a N percentage point <unk> in growth of total real gnp 
 for the private domestic business economy the bias was a bit over N percentage point 
 in other words the growth rates of both total gnp and real private business product per labor hour have been underestimated by about N N

 union carbide corp. said third-quarter net income plunged N N from a year earlier on weakness in the company 's mainstay chemicals and plastics business 
 net was $ N million or N cents a share for the quarter compared with $ N million or $ N a share a year ago 
 sales were $ N billion up N N from $ N billion the previous year 
 carbide like other companies with a heavy reliance on the so-called commodity end of the chemicals industry was expected to post earnings sharply lower than in an exceptionally strong N third quarter 
 but the company 's latest quarter was a few pennies a share lower than the more pessimistic projections on wall street 
 it certainly was n't a disaster but it does show weakness in some of the company 's chief markets said george <unk> a <unk> analyst at oppenheimer & co 
 in new york stock exchange composite trading carbide closed at $ N a share down N cents 
 prices for polyethylene a common plastic and an important carbide product started to fall early this year the slide accelerated in the third quarter as buyers continued to trim inventories 
 prices also fell for <unk> <unk> and <unk> products used in making <unk> 
 some producers of polyethylene figuring the inventory reductions are near an end have announced price boosts 
 the first real test of whether prices have hit bottom may come in the next several weeks when the new prices become effective 
 a carbide spokesman said the conditions are right for the increase to hold 
 for the third quarter operating profit from carbide 's chemicals and plastics business fell to $ N million from $ N million a year ago before accounting for taxes and interest expense 
 operating profit from carbon products such as <unk> <unk> also declined to $ N million from $ N million 
 in the <unk> segment operating profit climbed to $ N million from $ N million 
 the latest quarter included a gain of about $ N million on the sale of the company 's <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> businesses 
 <unk> <unk> are used in making <unk> products such as <unk> and <unk> <unk> are used in making the <unk> foam found in furniture <unk> and other products 
 that gain was mostly offset by a loss of about $ N million from a write-down in its <unk> business 
 <unk> is used in making integrated circuits 
 for the nine months net totaled $ N million or $ N a share up N N from $ N million or $ N a share a year ago

 at least N states are <unk> drexel burnham lambert inc. 's nationwide effort to settle its legal troubles and some might instead try to revoke the firm 's license to sell securities within their borders 
 the reluctance of some states to let drexel off the hook could <unk> the firm 's attempts to polish its image after its guilty plea to six <unk> last month say several people familiar with the discussions 
 up to now drexel has made a <unk> series of settlements with N states and the commonwealth of puerto rico 
 just yesterday new hampshire announced it made a $ N settlement with drexel a <unk> fine for a <unk> matter in that state 
 these states have been entering into settlements with drexel as part of the firm 's efforts to operate freely anywhere in the u.s. despite its record as an admitted <unk> 
 but individuals familiar with the generally successful drexel talks say the firm is meeting resistance from some big states including new jersey new york california pennsylvania connecticut and missouri 
 officials in some of these states say they do n't want to simply accept the settlements offered by drexel 
 they question if drexel is getting easier treatment than the many small <unk> firms whose brokerage licenses are routinely <unk> 
 drexel has to settle with state securities regulators in the wake of its criminal guilty plea and a related civil settlement with the securities and exchange commission that includes payment of $ N million in penalties 
 these stem from a two-year federal investigation of insider trading and securities fraud on wall street 
 ohio the district of columbia tennessee and illinois have been less <unk> to drexel than the other six states but nonetheless have refused to settle so far say those familiar with the discussions 
 drexel says it does n't expect any of its state brokerage licenses will be <unk> and even if some are its securities business would n't be directly hurt 
 it already has sold its retail or <unk> brokerage network securities firms do n't need brokerage licenses for <unk> activities such as investment banking 
 still if nothing else a <unk> brokerage license could be a burden because it must be disclosed in many of the transactions in which drexel could be involved 
 securities regulators <unk> drexel for its energetic effort led by <unk> general counsel saul s. cohen to settle its legal problems with the states 
 but they disagree about the message these settlements give to the public 
 there was a lot of internal debate about that specific issue said susan bryant oklahoma 's chief securities regulator and president of the north american securities administrators association which drafted a voluntary settlement plan for the states with drexel 
 the question she said is whether drexel should be allowed to pay and move on or whether you should simply revoke the license when someone is convicted of a felony 
 while ms. bryant 's state went ahead and accepted drexel 's settlement offer of $ N she said i do n't have any argument with those who came to different conclusions 
 i can see both sides 
 similarly alfred <unk> new hampshire 's director of securities regulation said his state had n't received any complaints about drexel so it really could n't press the issue 
 still i understand the reasons that other states are holding out he said 
 mr. cohen the drexel general counsel said i do n't think as we say in investment banking that by the end of the day we 'll be losing any licenses 
 asked about states that are taking a hard line he said there are states that have asked for additional information which we are providing to them 
 mr. cohen said more than $ N million has been paid to N states and that drexel still expects to pay out a total of $ N million 
 by the end of this week drexel should have another three to four settlements mr. cohen said 
 the rate we 're going i think that by the end of the month we 're looking to have a total of N to N he said 
 that total would be important for drexel 
 the investment bank has previously announced that as part of its punishment it would create an independent foundation to promote ethical behavior in the securities industry 
 a <unk> to that promise is that a minimum of N states reach settlement agreements before next tuesday 
 there are according to several securities commissioners at least N states that are either close to settlements with drexel or who do n't appear opposed to settling 
 drexel 's proposed state fines have been based on a state 's population and on the size of drexel 's business in the state 
 new jersey for example was asked to accept $ N but refused 
 the state is n't ruling out <unk> drexel 's brokerage license 
 the state can also bar drexel as an investment adviser 
 state officials wo n't describe their position in detail but james <unk> smith state securities chief said we really are still looking at it and have informed drexel that the proposal is really not sufficient for settlement 
 connecticut already has issued a notice of intent to revoke drexel 's brokerage license 
 it is one of the states that have met with mr. cohen and asked for additional information about investors ' accounts and other matters 
 this particular issue goes to the very integrity of the <unk> market state banking commissioner howard brown said 
 a banking department spokesman added commissioner brown does n't feel that money alone is the issue here 
 particularly touchy are the cases of new york which is drexel 's base and california the base of drexel 's highly profitable junk-bond operation that led to the firm 's legal difficulties 
 neither state has settled and officials in the two states wo n't discuss their reasons for not doing so 
 but drexel has made it clear it could mount a significant legal battle in each state if its license is <unk> according to state officials 
 ms. bryant the head of the state securities group said drexel has done a better job of settling with the states than <unk> hutton did after its guilty plea to a massive <unk> scheme several years ago 
 still she said drexel 's trouble with some states is n't a bad thing 
 this process should point out that it 's not going to be easy for a firm that 's convicted of a felony to immediately jump back into the retail business ms. bryant said 
 we need to have somebody worried so they do n't do this again 
 these are the N states including the commonwealth of puerto rico that have settled with drexel alaska arkansas delaware georgia hawaii idaho indiana iowa kansas kentucky maine maryland minnesota mississippi new hampshire new mexico north <unk> oklahoma oregon south carolina south <unk> utah vermont washington wyoming and puerto rico 
 time warner inc. reported a third-quarter net loss of $ N million or $ N cents a share reflecting acquisition costs for a N N stake in warner communications inc. and the purchase method of accounting for the transaction 
 separately warner reported a net loss of $ N million or N cents a share including merger expenses of $ N million and $ N million in charges associated with <unk> compensation plans 
 time warner is in the process of completing its acquisition of the remaining warner shares 
 time warner emphasized in a news release that it should be <unk> based on its cash flow which the company defined as earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization 
 on a <unk> basis assuming the merger was effective jan N N including the results from both time inc. and all of warner that cash flow figure would be $ N million for the latest quarter more than double the comparable figure a year ago or $ N million according to time warner 
 some analysts at least are buying that argument and were n't alarmed by the losses 
 what really matters is the operating income of the divisions i look at these numbers and i say these businesses are doing well said mark <unk> a vice president of donaldson lufkin & jenrette securities corp 
 for example warner made more than $ N million from <unk> entertainment in three months 
 that 's a big number 
 warner also had a gain of more than N N from records and music publishing even though the domestic record business was sluggish this summer 
 in the year-ago third quarter time on its own reported net income of $ N million or $ N a share 
 combined revenue for the latest quarter of time warner was $ N billion compared with the year-ago time revenue of $ N billion 
 on a pro <unk> basis including all of warner 's earnings time warner had a third-quarter loss of $ N million compared with a $ N million loss a year earlier 
 on the same basis revenue rose to $ N billion from $ N billion 
 for the third quarter warner 's $ N million loss compared with a year-ago loss of $ N million or N cents a share

 time warner said its cable division turned in a N N increase in operating cash flow to $ N million from $ N million reflecting higher <unk> revenue 
 in addition the N results included a $ N million charge reflecting a reserve for relocation related expenses at american television & communications corp 
 on the other hand time warner said its operating cash flow declined in the quarter for its magazine division its books division and the home box office programming division 
 in magazines higher advertising revenues at sports illustrated and fortune were offset by lower ad revenue for other major magazines 
 the programming division saw a decline in operating cash flow because the year-ago quarter included a $ N million dividend from turner broadcasting system and because the quarter includes expenses associated with the nov. N launch of hbo 's comedy channel

 mr. simmons declined to comment and the white house said the congressmen 's letter is under review 
 the letter dated last thursday cited the losses at valley national and at united bank also of phoenix where mr. simmons was chairman for N years 
 both banks have been battered as have other arizona banks by falling real estate prices 
 valley national for example had $ N million in problem assets as of june 
 we believe that there are numerous other candidates more qualified for this important position and we encourage you to give them your <unk> consideration before making this key rtc appointment the letter said 
 the rtc needs the most able competent management available 
 but mr. simmons has long ties to both republicans and banking 
 he was <unk> of mr. bush 's arizona campaign committee in last year 's election and also worked for mr. bush in the N election 
 the two met more than N years ago when mr. simmons worked for commercial bank & trust co. of midland texas where mr. bush was an organizing director

 lloyd 's once a <unk> of the world insurance market is being shaken to its very foundation 
 the <unk> exchange is battered by enormous claims from a <unk> run of unprecedented disasters the most recent of which is last week 's earthquake in california 's bay area 
 at the same time lloyd 's is besieged by <unk> investors and <unk> by inefficient but <unk> ways of conducting business 
 the exchange is gradually being squeezed into narrow <unk> segments of the market by less <unk> competitors 
 lloyd 's is on the ropes says peter <unk> a lloyd 's investor for N years who now leads a dissident group threatening to sue exchange underwriters for alleged <unk> and negligence 
 it needs more discipline 
 it needs to sort itself out 
 most troublesome is the shrinking pool of names the <unk> investors some of them royal who as members of about N syndicates underwrite policies 
 some N members quit the exchange last year more than triple the number of resignations in N 
 names are resigning at an even faster pace this year 
 lackluster returns are one reason 
 the average after-tax return on investment in N the most recent year for which results are available was N N according to <unk> ltd. an insurance consulting firm in london 
 in N it was N N 
 between N and N the most recent five-year period for which figures are available lloyd 's reported over # N billion in claims and reserves against future losses $ N billion at today 's exchange rates more than double the # N billion posted in the previous five-year period 
 many of the N investors who remain are beginning to question one of the exchange 's most basic <unk> the concept of <unk> personal liability 
 investors may reap huge profits when premiums exceed claims but they are liable to their last pound or dollar in the event of a catastrophe 
 and catastrophes are getting ever more costly 
 lloyd 's claims for the N <unk> <unk> <unk> disaster in the north sea for instance may reach $ N billion 
 during the five-year period ended N roughly N N of the names had money tied up in money-losing syndicates according to <unk> consultants 
 the <unk> of <unk> liability looms large for a number of them now

 <unk> is widespread among exchange members 
 i ca n't think of any reason to join lloyd 's now says keith whitten a british businessman and a lloyd 's member since N 
 the downside is very considerable and at the moment the upside is very marginal 
 if profits do n't improve mr. whitten says he may quit the exchange 
 meanwhile competition from rivals <unk> by history is <unk> 
 lloyd 's is being squeezed out of <unk> but more consistently profitable product lines such as primary property and marine insurance 
 over the past decade competitors have <unk> away at the exchange 's share of the # N billion marine market in london where half the world 's ships are insured 
 lloyd 's N N stake in that market has <unk> to N N in that period according to an official at the institute of london underwriters a lloyd 's competitor 
 the official asked not to be named 
 much of the business has gone to the institute an association of more than N insurers including cigna corp. allianz <unk> ag of west germany and britain 's commercial union assurance plc 
 lloyd 's has <unk> decades of <unk> decline 
 at the peak of its power and influence a century ago lloyd 's dominated the insurance world with a N N stake 
 it virtually <unk> how ships were to be built and it monitored commerce through a <unk> intelligence network in ports around the globe 
 today lloyd 's share of the world market excluding life insurance is about N N 
 its stake is even smaller if life insurance is included 
 bigger rivals such as aetna and allianz backed by <unk> of <unk> using computers in hundreds of branches operate more efficiently and often can offer lower rates brokers say 
 though lloyd 's <unk> such <unk> policies as worker 's compensation insurance <unk> insurance for homeowners and businesses and bankers ' liability insurance competitors now underwrite most of that business 
 beyond that many big oil chemical and airline companies are <unk> off big chunks of the market by <unk> themselves through <unk> offshore companies for <unk> coverage 
 even lloyd 's specialty unusually risky ventures is being challenged 
 only N years ago for instance lloyd 's was the <unk> insurer of thoroughbred horses 
 but since N kirk horse insurance inc. of lexington ky. has grabbed a N N stake of the market 
 ronald kirk president says lloyd 's has suffered because its structure does n't allow underwriters to deal directly with clients brokers are required <unk> 
 thus he asserts lloyd 's ca n't react quickly to competition 
 lloyd 's has lost control of the situation he says 
 they are n't controlling their <unk> like they used to 
 murray lawrence lloyd 's chairman agrees the exchange faces big challenges 
 this is a <unk> time and we are trying to plot our way ahead he says 
 we have been a great market for <unk> risks which other people then take copy and cut rates 
 lloyd 's he says is cut off from the vast body of premium down at the bottom end which acts as a <unk> influence against catastrophic losses 
 by that he means <unk> but <unk> products such as certain types of primary property insurance 
 the exchange he says must find new products and new markets 
 that wo n't be an easy task 
 tradition is dictator at lloyd 's 
 three years ago the exchange took up residence in a <unk> tower of steel and glass <unk> of the kind of modern architecture that britain 's prince charles has denounced 
 some exchange <unk> call the building the oil rig 
 but along with such <unk> <unk> as lord nelson 's <unk> lloyd 's also brought its <unk> ways of doing business 
 the lloyd 's market actively <unk> insurance just N N hours a day brokers say 
 underwriting does n't get under way until after morning tea at N a.m 
 a <unk> lunch break follows 
 things wind down at about N p.m. just in time for afternoon tea 
 lloyd 's vast trading hall houses a warren of <unk> desks 
 the hall 's few computers are used mostly to send messages 
 <unk> between desks underwriters sit on <unk> surrounded by <unk> of policies 
 brokers <unk> thick <unk> stand in lines waiting their turn to speak to the underwriters 
 a broker may have to approach as many as N underwriters who insure the <unk> on behalf of the syndicates 
 it could take six months for a claim to be paid 
 the system says nicholas <unk> a lloyd 's broker who left the exchange in N is so <unk> <unk> it drives you mad 
 some maintain underwriters also have been <unk> 
 john <unk> a lloyd 's underwriter says he and his fellow underwriters underestimated by as much as N N the premiums they should have charged for property risks from N to N 
 how <unk> we must have appeared to the outside world how incompetent at risk assessment and evaluation he says 
 lloyd 's officials decline to comment on the matter 
 more recently property rates have increased 
 many at lloyd 's expect the san francisco earthquake will cause the industry to boost rates even further 
 but it will be years before it is clear whether higher rates will offset the payouts for such disasters 
 the magnitude of the exchange 's problems may not become known for some time because of lloyd 's practice of leaving the books open for three years to allow for the settlement of claims 
 lloyd 's only recently reported its financial results for N 
 that year it posted record pretax profit of # N million a gain it attributes to higher rates and fewer claims 
 but mr. lawrence says reported profit will be down in N N and N though he declines to specify how steep the decline will be 
 insurance analysts say the exchange 's downturn in profitability is likely to be <unk> by more than $ N million in aviation losses including the N pan am airline disaster over <unk> scotland and a <unk> chunk of claims from september 's hurricane hugo 
 lloyd 's says the departures of names is n't likely to hurt its underwriting capacity currently about # N billion 
 mr. lawrence says the drain of funds has been offset by an increase in investments by the remaining names 
 meanwhile the exchange has been trying to lower costs 
 it recently cut its work force by N N or N 
 but lloyd 's is hampered in its efforts to overhaul operations by its reluctance to <unk> modern technology 
 mr. <unk> the underwriter <unk> half of his business could be <unk> by computer cutting costs at least N N 
 though lloyd 's has talked for years about <unk> underwriting transactions the effort has n't gotten very far 
 competition among underwriters and brokers makes them loath to <unk> price and policy information 
 both groups <unk> to traditional face-to-face dealings even for routine policies 
 lloyd 's <unk> bureaucracy also <unk> efforts to update marketing strategies 
 some underwriters have been pressing for years to tap the <unk> business by selling some policies directly to consumers 
 lloyd 's <unk> sells only auto insurance directly to the public and such policies are sold only in limited markets such as the u.k. and canada 
 but such changes must be cleared by four internal committees and dozens of underwriters brokers and administrators before being implemented 
 the proposal to sell directly to the public remains mired in bureaucratic <unk> 
 lloyd 's is moving forward on some fronts though 
 mr. lawrence says the exchange is <unk> some procedures to make <unk> payments on claims 
 by next year all underwriters will be linked to a communications network that could reduce paper work on claims 
 japan 's daiwa securities co. named <unk> dozen president 
 mr. dozen succeeds <unk> <unk> who will become vice chairman 
 <unk> <unk> retains his title of chairman of daiwa japan 's second-largest securities firm 
 in japanese firms the president usually is in charge of day-to-day operations while the chairman 's role is more a <unk> one 
 the title of chief executive officer is n't used 
 while people within daiwa particularly <unk> expected that mr. dozen N would eventually become daiwa 's president the speed of his promotion surprised many 
 it was only earlier this year that the <unk> <unk> executive he likes to joke with americans about how his name is <unk> with twelve was appointed deputy president 
 mr. dozen is taking over the reins of a securities company that does very well in its domestic market but that is still seeking to realize its potential in global investment banking and securities dealing 
 daiwa is one of the world 's largest securities firms 
 as of march N the daiwa group had shareholder equity of N billion yen $ N billion 
 for the six months ended sept. N daiwa reported unconsolidated parent company net income of N billion yen $ N million on revenue of N billion yen $ N billion 
 both figures were record highs 
 several observers interpreted mr. dozen 's appointment as an attempt by daiwa to make its international operations more profitable while preparing the firm for the effects of the continuing deregulation of japan 's domestic markets which should mean increased competition 
 all of japan 's so-called big four securities firms nomura securities co. ltd. the world 's largest nikko securities co. ltd. yamaichi securities co. ltd. and daiwa have suffered setbacks in their attempts to break into foreign markets 
 while they have moved to the <unk> in underwriting fixed-income securities in the <unk> market mostly for japanese firms they have been only marginally profitable if at all in the u.s. 
 american institutional investors have never had a large appetite for japanese equities 
 and while the japanese have stepped up their purchases of u.s. shares in the past several months they have shown themselves in the past to be <unk> investors 
 at the same time daiwa and its <unk> have faced stiff competition from <unk> american competitors that have prevented them from building strong links to u.s. corporations and institutional investors 
 mr. dozen knows these problems <unk> 
 when he arrived in the u.s. in N the start of an <unk> tour he tried selling japanese <unk> bonds to u.s. investors 
 he made desperate efforts using the yellow pages from beginning to end said <unk> <unk> president of daiwa 's u.s. unit 
 but not a single piece of paper was sold 
 by his own account mr. dozen did n't do much better with u.s. bonds 
 in an interview a few months ago he recalled how after some training at salomon brothers inc. he successfully bid for the opportunity to sell portions of N u.s. corporate bond issues 
 but he could n't sell any 
 japanese stock salesmen selling american bonds 
 maybe it 's crazy he said 
 mr. dozen even related the <unk> suffered when he and two colleagues went on an overnight fishing <unk> off the new jersey shore and caught nothing 
 upon returning to new york exhausted i got into a <unk> and the woman driver said americans make better <unk> he recalled 
 <unk> mr. dozen said that daiwa 's goal is to build a high-technology <unk> international organization with maybe some japanese flavor to it 
 he said that he was particularly interested in his firm gaining expertise in futures options <unk> securities computerized trading and investment systems as well as mergers and acquisitions 
 mr. dozen said daiwa 's strengths were its large capital base its influential position in the tokyo market and its links to japanese corporations and institutional investors 
 mr. dozen joined daiwa upon his <unk> from <unk> university in N 
 like many young <unk> in japanese securities firms he began his career peddling stock to individual investors 
 in his climb to the top mr. dozen also headed the company 's <unk> division its fixed-income units and its international operations 
 he was constantly picking up new things to fill out his experience he is very <unk> said <unk> <unk> chairman of daiwa 's u.s. unit in new york 
 but it mr. dozen 's experience as a salesman that enabled him to gain the political support particularly from the retail sales force to <unk> to the presidency 
 commission income from domestic stock and bond sales accounts form a large portion of japanese securities companies ' earnings 
 and anybody who lacked the backing of the retail sales force would be fragile said a daiwa executive 
 if mr. dozen has a weakness it may be his golf game 
 he digs in the sand instead of hitting the ball like a farmer said mr. <unk> 
 inco ltd. posted a N N decline in third-quarter net income a performance that was in line with analysts ' expectations 
 the nickel producer also raised its quarterly dividend to N cents a share from N cents and said it may buy back as much as N N of its common outstanding 
 inco shares fell after the announcements 
 analysts said some investors were disappointed that the <unk> company had failed to announce a special dividend 
 inco closed at $ N a share down N cents in new york stock exchange composite trading 
 some analysts said inco which had cash reserves of $ N million as of sept. N could still announce a special dividend in the next few months though it would be smaller than the $ <unk> special dividend it paid last year 
 the quarterly dividend is payable dec. N to shares of record nov. N 
 inco 's net fell to $ N million or $ N a share in the third quarter from $ N million or $ N a share a year earlier 
 sales rose N N to $ N million from $ N million 
 excluding special gains from tax-loss <unk> earnings in the latest quarter were $ N million or $ N a share compared with $ N million or $ N a share 
 inco said the drop in earnings resulted mainly from lower nickel prices for the period and a temporary cut in nickel output at the company 's manitoba operations due to high levels of <unk> in the <unk> 
 inco said it plans to buy back as many as five million common shares over the next N months if nickel market conditions are favorable 
 under a previous <unk> program inco has purchased N million of its shares since april 
 ual corp. 's board <unk> any prospects for an immediate revival of a labor-management buy-out saying united airlines ' parent should remain independent for now 
 as a result ual 's chairman stephen m. wolf pulled out of the buy-out effort to focus on running the company 
 the two developments put the acquisition attempt back to square one and leaves the airline with an array of <unk> matters including an unsettled labor situation and a management scrambling to restore its damaged credibility 
 the effort to create the nation 's largest <unk> company began <unk> oct. N when the labor-management group was unable to obtain financing for its $ 300-a-share $ N billion offer 
 just last week it suffered another major setback when british airways plc the largest equity investor in the labor-management bid withdrew its support 
 takeover stock traders focusing on the company 's intention to stay independent took the announcement as bad news 
 ual which had risen $ N to $ N in composite trading on the new york stock exchange on reports of a new bid being prepared by the group reversed course and plummeted in <unk> trading after the N p.m. edt announcement 
 among the first trades reported by the securities firm of jefferies & co. which makes a market in ual after the exchange is closed were N shares at $ N N shares at $ N N at $ N and N at $ N 
 the rebound in ual stock during regular trading hours monday was its first daily gain after six consecutive losses left the price N N below its level before oct. N the day the group announced the bank financing could n't be obtained for the original deal 
 twelve of ual 's outside directors met at a <unk> meeting yesterday in chicago to consider an informal proposal from the buy-out group for a revised bid 
 but the board said it was n't interested for now 
 that proposal valued at between $ N and $ N a share would have transferred majority ownership to employees while leaving some stock in public hands 
 the buy-out group had no firm financing for the plan 
 and with no other offers on the table the board apparently felt no pressure to act on it 
 the directors signaled however that they would be willing to consider future offers or take some other action to maximize shareholder value saying they would continue to explore all strategic and financial alternatives 
 but it was clear that for the time being the board wants the company to return to <unk> 
 the board said it concluded that the welfare of the company its shareholders its employees and the broader public can best be enhanced by continued development of ual as a strong viable independent company 
 mr. wolf urged all employees to now turn their full attention to operating the airline 
 he also vowed to make every effort to <unk> a <unk> new relationship that has been <unk> with participating employee groups 
 but mr. wolf faces a <unk> task in pulling the company back together again 
 labor problems top the list 
 for a brief time the buy-out effort seemed to solve his problems with united 's pilot union 
 in return for an ownership stake in the company the pilots were willing to agree to a seven-year contract that included a <unk> clause and significant wage concessions and productivity gains the union previously resisted 
 that contract was tied to the success of the buy-out 
 as a <unk> measure the pilots had been working four extra hours a month and had agreed to fly ual 's two new boeing N aircraft 
 it 's uncertain if the pilots will continue to do so without a contract settlement 
 the union said late last night that it is still committed to majority employee ownership and that the labor disputes that faced the company prior to the buy-out effort still need to be addressed 
 the buy-out effort also <unk> <unk> relations between united 's pilot and <unk> unions 
 the machinists ' criticisms of the labor-management bid and their threats of a strike unless they received substantial wage increases this year helped cool banks ' interest in financing the transaction 
 the machinists previously had shown themselves to be an ally to mr. wolf but he lost much of his credibility with that group when he <unk> up with the pilot union 
 the machinists criticized the terms mr. wolf and management received in the buy-out 
 they paid $ N million for a N N stake and received an additional N N of the company at no additional cost 
 his credibility is also on the line in the investment community 
 until the collapse of this bid mr. wolf was regarded as one of the nation 's <unk> airline executives after engineering <unk> of tiger international inc. and republic airlines 
 but he and his chief financial officer john pope <unk> some of the seeds for the deal 's failure by insisting banks accept low financing fees and interest rates while they invested in the transaction only a small fraction of the $ N million they stood to gain from sale of their ual stock and options 
 the board 's actions leave takeover stock traders nursing some $ N million in losses and eager to respond to anyone who might make a new offer 
 it also inevitably leaves a <unk> of shareholder lawsuits 
 arbitragers said they were disappointed the company did n't announce some recapitalization or other plan to maximize value 
 one takeover expert noted that arbitragers could force a recapitalization through the written consent process under which holders may oust the board by a majority vote 
 the machinists union has suggested it may propose a recapitalization that includes a special dividend for holders and a minority ownership stake for employees 
 los angeles investor marvin davis whose $ <unk> offer for ual in august triggered a bidding war says he remains interested in the airline 
 however he is restricted from making certain hostile moves by an agreement he signed to obtain confidential ual data 
 essentially he ca n't make any hostile moves unless he makes a tender offer at least $ N a share 
 tandy corp. said it wo n't join u.s. memories the group that seeks to battle the japanese in the market for computer memory chips 
 tandy 's decision is a second setback for u.s. memories 
 last month apple computer inc. said that it would n't invest in the group 
 apple said that its money would be better spent in areas such as research and development 
 u.s. memories is seeking major investors to back its attempt to crack the $ N billion market for dynamic random access memory chips a market dominated by the japanese 
 those chips were in dire shortage last year hurting many u.s. computer companies that could n't get sufficient <unk> chips 
 tandy said its experience during the shortage did n't merit the $ N million to $ N million investment u.s. memories is seeking from each investor 
 at this time we elected not to get involved because we have been able to satisfy our need for <unk> from the market as a rule said ed <unk> tandy 's director of market planning 
 sanford kane u.s. memories president said the decision was disappointing but does n't <unk> u.s. memories ' failure 
 i would like to have had them he said 
 but they were n't on my list of companies who were critical to be a part of it 
 mr. kane became president and chief executive officer of u.s. memories last june when the group was formed by seven electronics companies advanced micro devices inc. digital equipment corp. hewlett-packard co. intel corp. international business machines corp. lsi logic corp. and national semiconductor corp 
 mr. kane said he expects two or three major corporations to announce their participation in u.s. memories soon after the group <unk> a business plan probably late this week 
 u.s. memories needs a catalyst he said to <unk> others to join 
 but so far most potential participants have n't decided 
 sun microsystems inc. said it 's still actively evaluating u.s. memories and plans to meet with u.s. memories representatives later this week 
 american telephone & telegraph co. said it was waiting to see u.s. memories ' business plan 
 personal-computer maker <unk> research inc. said it is still studying the situation 
 a compaq computer corp. spokeswoman said that the company has n't made a decision yet although it is n't under active consideration 
 in a startling <unk> members of the senate intelligence committee are complaining that someone in the executive branch is <unk> on them 
 david boren the intelligence committee chairman is upset that someone <unk> a letter to the committee from the reagan administration suggesting that the u.s. would <unk> to warn panamanian <unk> manuel noriega if it got wind of an impending coup that might result in his assassination 
 with due respect to highly classified <unk> and other <unk> the <unk> are performing a public service 
 if the cia has become a protection service for mr. noriega the american people ought to know 
 what went wrong in panama is a <unk> subject for public and congressional inquiry 
 naturally senator boren and his committee would like free rein to blame the executive branch while <unk> top secret on their own <unk> 
 but there 's no danger of <unk> sources and methods in disclosing the debate running up and down pennsylvania avenue 
 and if congress is going to assume authority to <unk> foreign policy it 's going to have to take some of the responsibility too 
 the president of the united states urged the panamanian armed forces to move against mr. noriega 
 when they did his <unk> did n't have the initiative to do more than block a couple of roads 
 the executive branch bears the first responsibility for <unk> 
 but what kind of initiative can you expect given the climate set by congress 
 for example what exactly did the cia tell major <unk> and his fellow coup <unk> about u.s. laws and executive orders on assassinations 
 what part did u.s. warnings play in the major 's <unk> to pull the trigger when he had general noriega in custody but was under attack by <unk> troops 
 mr. noriega did n't suffer from any <unk> once he had the <unk> 
 maybe we need a cia version of the <unk> warning you have the right to <unk> your coup intentions because we may <unk> on you 
 or maybe a surgeon general 's warning <unk> in the united states may be fatal 
 cia chief william webster hardly a washington <unk> got the debate started last week by noting that the executive order banning assassinations had contributed to u.s. <unk> during the coup 
 the cia 's deputy director of operations richard <unk> tried to smooth things over a few days later but instead simply <unk> mr. webster 's point 
 the interpretation of the executive order mr. <unk> said and the way in which the various committees have over time interpreted it has led in my view to a proper caution on the part of operators including me 
 in other words congress wo n't let the cia do much of anything anymore and that 's fine with the cia 
 the pay 's the same and the duty 's lighter 
 and of course doing anything that might be <unk> by congress carries heavy penalties 
 witness the <unk> prosecution of <unk> north 
 the intelligence committee 's ranking republican senator william cohen joined with senator george mitchell to write a best seller about iran-contra <unk> men of <unk> 
 no doubt many people in the cia the pentagon and the national security council have read it 
 what kind of initiative should anyone expect from people out on the line who 've read all this and know what can happen if they fail 
 who wants to end up as the <unk> in a bill cohen <unk> play 
 the order against assassinations is another <unk> of the same congressional <unk> a product of the 1970s vietnam syndrome against any executive action 
 president bush would do himself and the country a favor by <unk> the order as an <unk> <unk> on his ability to defend america 's national security 
 there are of course good reasons the u.s. should n't get into the assassination business but <unk> the executive order is not the same thing as saying the u.s. should start passing out <unk> <unk> 
 the world being the nasty place it is we want presidents to have the freedom to order operations in which someone might get killed 
 in such situations you can not write rules in advance you can only make sure the president takes the responsibility 
 the executive order and the reported agreements with the intelligence committee are neither <unk> nor moral 
 as it now stands the u.s. can bomb <unk> but ca n't <unk> <unk> <unk> 
 it can send a fighter <unk> to <unk> terrorist <unk> in the <unk> valley but ca n't shoot <unk> <unk> 
 both the assassination order and the quality of debate in washington are telling the world that the only way the u.s. will kill a <unk> is by making sure we take some innocent <unk> with him 
 we 've heard california 's <unk> proposition N blamed for a lot over the years but abc 's ted <unk> came up with a new <unk> in his earthquake coverage last week when he asked democratic <unk> richard katz if <unk> N had withheld money needed for road maintenance 
 mr. katz <unk> agreed sliding over the fact that california 's roads and bridges are n't funded by property taxes but by state and federal gasoline taxes 
 both have been raised at least N N in recent years even while the price of gasoline has fallen 
 dragging <unk> N into this story is a pretty long stretch 
 a series of explosions <unk> through the huge phillips petroleum co. plastics plant near here <unk> more than a hundred and closing parts of the houston ship channel 
 there were no immediate reports of deaths but officials said a number of workers were still <unk> for last night

 exxon corp. said its third-quarter earnings slipped N N as profits from two of its three major businesses sagged 
 all cleanup costs from last spring 's alaskan oil spill were reflected in earlier results it said 
 phillips petroleum co. and atlantic richfield co. also reported declines in quarterly profit while ashland oil inc. posted a loss for the latest quarter 
 <unk> hess corp. and occidental petroleum corp. reported higher earnings 
 exxon 
 although exxon spent heavily during the latest quarter to clean up the alaskan <unk> <unk> by its huge oil spill those expenses as well as the cost of a continuing <unk> program are covered by $ N million in charges taken during the first half 
 an exxon official said that at this time the oil company does n't anticipate any additional charges to future earnings relating to the cleanup of oil <unk> when one of its <unk> <unk> into an <unk> <unk> 
 she added however that charges already taken do n't take into account the potential effect of litigation involving the oil spill 
 she said that impact ca n't be reasonably assessed yet 
 exxon 's net income during the third quarter dropped to $ N billion or N cents a share from $ N billion or N cents a share a year earlier 
 revenue rose N N to $ N billion from $ N billion 
 during the third quarter exxon purchased N million shares of its stock at a cost of $ N million 
 exxon 's profitability like that of many other oil companies was hurt during the third quarter by declining returns from the chemicals and refining and marketing businesses 
 exxon 's earnings from chemicals operations fell $ N million to $ N million while refining and marketing profits declined $ N million to $ N million 
 although crude oil prices were significantly higher this year they were n't strong enough to offset the declining profits in those business sectors at most oil companies said william <unk> oil analyst for first boston corp 
 he estimates that the price of west texas intermediate the u.s. benchmark crude was $ N a barrel higher during the third quarter of this year than in the same period last year 
 ashland oil 
 a rash of one-time charges left ashland oil with a loss of $ N million for its fiscal fourth quarter

 hess declined to comment 
 phillips petroleum 
 phillips petroleum 's third-quarter earnings slid N N to $ N million or N cents a share from $ N million or N cents a share 
 revenue rose N N to $ N billion from $ N billion 
 shrinking profit margins in chemical and refining and marketing sectors accounted for most of the decline said chairman <unk> <unk> in a statement 
 despite higher oil prices exploration and production profits were off because of foreign-currency losses and some construction costs incurred in one of phillips ' north sea oil fields 
 a year ago results were buoyed by a $ N million after-tax gain from an asset sale 
 occidental petroleum 
 occidental petroleum 's third-quarter net income rose N N to $ N million or N cents a share from $ N million or N cents a share a year earlier 
 the latest quarter included an after-tax gain of $ N million from <unk> items

 ingersoll publications co. agreed to buy the new haven register in a transaction valued at $ N million from goodson newspaper group inc 
 as part of the agreement goodson also terminated the contract under which ingersoll manages goodson 's N newspapers ending a long association between the two companies that has turned increasingly bitter recently 
 goodson has accused ingersoll of paying less attention to its properties and more to such ventures as the recent launch of the st. louis sun 
 under the terms of the accord ingersoll will pay about $ N million for the register a daily that goodson bought for about $ N million in N 
 goodson will pay the additional $ N million in settlement of the management contract 
 goodson also announced that it hired the former president and senior vice president of ingersoll to run the goodson papers 
 both executives left the company after <unk> with chairman ralph ingersoll jr 
 goodson which is based here will use part of the proceeds to pay down debt associated with its purchase of the morristown daily record for $ N million in N 
 the new jersey paper like the new haven conn. paper was purchased by ingersoll on goodson 's behalf as part of the management contract 
 industry analysts have said that the purchase price for the paper was too high causing a strain on goodson 's finances 
 investment bankers familiar with the company said goodson is seeking a new bank credit line of $ N million and may have to sell additional newspapers 
 david n. <unk> president and chief operating officer of goodson said in a telephone interview that the company does n't currently have any plans to sell additional newspapers 
 goodson said david carr former president of ingersoll publications and ray <unk> former senior vice president would head the new in-house management team at goodson which had revenue of $ N million in N 
 the association between the two companies <unk> back <unk> years to a friendship between television producer mark goodson and ingersoll founder ralph ingersoll 
 the latter 's son ralph ingersoll jr. took over the company and has been managing the goodson properties and acting as an agent in the purchase of newspapers for goodson 
 but in recent years mr. ingersoll began focusing more on expanding his own newspaper empire in partnership with investment banking firm warburg <unk> & co 
 ingersoll has N <unk> and N other <unk> papers in the u.s. and europe 
 the company said its revenue will exceed $ N million this year 
 ingersoll president robert m. <unk> said in a statement that the company is <unk> by the conclusion of the goodson relationship and will be able to concentrate all our <unk> on ingersoll 's own papers 
 mr. goodson in his own statement was less upbeat saying unfortunately over the past few years it has become increasingly clear that ralph and i have different <unk> and that he feels more comfortable with a management team whose sole interest and responsibility is in the goodson papers 
 just five months after ogilvy group was <unk> up in an unsolicited takeover kenneth roman ogilvy 's chairman and chief executive officer said he is leaving to take a top post at american express co 
 mr. roman N years old abruptly announced he will leave the venerable ad agency whose largest client is american express to become american express 's executive vice president for corporate affairs and communications 
 he will succeed harry l. freeman N who has said he will retire in december 
 mr. freeman said in august that he would retire by the end of this year to take executive responsibility for an embarrassing effort to <unk> banker <unk> <unk> 
 american express representatives apparently influenced the publication of unfavorable articles about mr. <unk> 
 the company later <unk> and agreed to make $ N million in contributions to charities chosen by him 
 although mr. freeman is retiring he will continue to work as a consultant for american express on a project basis 
 ad industry executives were n't surprised by mr. roman 's decision to leave ogilvy 
 the agency under his direction bitterly fought a takeover attempt by wpp group plc of london before <unk> in may 
 and although mr. roman and wpp 's chief executive martin sorrell have gone out of their way to be publicly supportive of each other people close to mr. roman say he was unhappy giving up control of the company 
 some executives also cite tension because of efforts by mr. sorrell a financial man to cut costs at the agency 
 mr. roman will be succeeded as the head of ogilvy 's flagship ad agency ogilvy & mather worldwide by graham phillips N who had been president of north american operations and who like mr. sorrell is british 
 alexander <unk> N will take on the newly created position of president of the world-wide agency and chief executive of its international operations 
 he had been president of the international operations 
 mr. roman also had <unk> ogilvy group 's two other units the <unk> <unk> <unk> advertising agency and its research division but those units will now report directly to wpp 
 mr. roman appears <unk> for the american express job 
 known as a traditional executive he is very much in the conservative american express <unk> 
 moreover after N years at ogilvy he had <unk> a reputation for being <unk> and a straight arrow which can only help american express in the wake of the <unk> incident 
 he also is close to american express 's chairman and chief executive officer james d. robinson iii 
 aside from working with mr. robinson on the american express advertising account for about N years mr. roman serves on several of the same charities and boards as mr. robinson 
 the abrupt management change sparked widespread speculation that mr. roman had been pushed out of ogilvy 's top spot by mr. sorrell 
 but mr. roman <unk> denied the speculation saying mr. sorrell had tried several times to persuade him to stay offering various incentives and in one instance sending a note with a case of wine the wine naturally was seagram 's brand an ogilvy client 
 he asked me not to resign 
 the implication that i was pushed aside would n't be accurate mr. roman said 
 mr. sorrell traveling in the far east could n't be reached 
 mr. roman said american express 's mr. robinson first approached him about the job in late september 
 according to industry executives peter <unk> a former european community commissioner from ireland was also a serious <unk> for the american express job 
 although it ultimately was n't offered to him he will be on <unk> to american express as an adviser on international matters 
 after talking on and off for the past four weeks mr. roman said he agreed to take the job because it 's the right time it 's a <unk> opportunity and i think i leave the company in very strong hands 
 it was my decision not anyone else 's 
 mr. roman also brushed aside reports about <unk> between him and mr. phillips his successor at ogilvy 
 the two executives could hardly be more different 
 mr. roman comes across as a <unk> executive mr. phillips has a <unk> <unk> 
 during time off mr. roman tends to his garden mr. phillips <unk> to a <unk> for among other things fast cars and planes 
 industry executives say that although the two executives used to clash more frequently the wpp takeover brought them closer together 
 i 'm the guy who made him head of new york head of the u.s. president of north america and recommended him to mr. sorrell as my successor 
 would i have done all those things <unk> if i did n't think he was the right guy mr. roman asked 
 he labeled reports of <unk> ridiculous and said that he spent part of the weekend on mr. phillips 's boat in connecticut 
 mr. roman will oversee american express 's public relations and government affairs among other things but he wo n't be involved in its advertising which is handled by the operating units 
 i consider this a second career he said 
 he also will sit on the company 's corporate planning and policy committee made up of the top corporate and operating executives 
 mr. roman 's departure is n't expected to have any enormous <unk> at ogilvy 
 american express kraft general foods and mattel executives said the move wo n't affect their relationships with the ad agency 
 general foods 's relationships with its agencies are based on the agencies ' work and will continue to be said david <unk> a vice president of kraft general foods 
 but some clients and analysts expressed concern that mr. phillips is n't as well-known to many clients 
 ken was my key contact said j. nicholas hahn president and chief executive officer of cotton inc. which represents cotton producers 
 i do n't know mr. phillips all that well 
 i have n't seen or talked to him in several years 
 and some analysts questioned whether mr. phillips would have the skills ogilvy needs to turn the agency around 
 while the agency has done well in many parts of the world its flagship new york office has had a dismal track record recently it has won few new accounts while losing big ones including maxwell house 
 i think mr. phillips is going to need some help 
 i think they need creative leadership and i do n't think they have it said <unk> hill an analyst with wertheim & co 
 ogilvy & mather 's top creative executive norman berry left the agency earlier this year 
 <unk> berry was a creative <unk> at the company and nobody has filled that <unk> said ms. hill 
 but other analysts said that having mr. phillips succeed mr. roman would make for a smooth transition 
 graham phillips has been there a long time knows the culture well is aggressive and apparently gets along well with mr. sorrell said andrew <unk> an analyst with drexel burnham lambert 
 it 's probably a reasonable transition 
 hopefully he 'll be the answer to the problems they 've had in new york

 turner broadcasting system inc. said it formed a unit to make and distribute movies to theaters overseas and eventually to u.s. theaters too 
 the operator of <unk> networks said the new turner pictures unit will produce movies that will premiere on turner broadcasting 's turner network television channel or <unk> and then will be released internationally in movie theaters 
 the unit 's first two offerings are slated to be the secret life of ian fleming a <unk> about the former british spy who wrote the james bond novels and <unk> island produced by <unk> <unk> who also stars in the movie 
 ted turner turner broadcasting 's chairman was named chairman of turner pictures and <unk> <unk> president of turner entertainment networks was named president of the unit 
 in an interview mr. <unk> said the subsidiary 's primary mission will be to make movies for <unk> and to distribute them internationally 
 but he said turner broadcasting already has found some ideas that might work well as films for theatrical release in the u.s. 
 when that occurs and when the time is right we 'll release the films in the u.s. he said adding that turner pictures may develop such movies next year for domestic release in N 
 turner has made several movies <unk> and <unk> for its networks in recent years but the company has never acted as a <unk> movie studio and released its own pictures to theaters 
 mr. <unk> said the secret life of ian fleming and <unk> island cost more than $ N million each to make which is only about one-third the cost of most movies made for theatrical release 
 the turner move is in line with a cable-tv trend toward more original programming and toward finding more ways to <unk> the high cost of producing films 
 in july viacom inc. formed viacom pictures to produce N <unk> movies a year that will premiere on showtime network and be distributed later in various markets including foreign theaters 
 in a sign the stock slump has n't <unk> europe 's takeover fever cie financiere de paribas said it intends to bid for one of france 's other large financial and industrial holding companies cie. de navigation mixte 
 paribas said that once it receives the <unk> from french stock market authorities it will offer to boost its navigation mixte stake to N N from the current N N 
 its <unk> bid values navigation mixte at about N billion francs $ N billion making this one of france 's <unk> attempted takeovers 
 the cost of buying the additional N N stake would be N billion francs $ N billion 
 the move would greatly boost paribas 's stake in the insurance transport and food businesses where navigation mixte is strong 
 it also would make paribas a major french ally of west germany 's allianz ag insurance group 
 allianz holds a N N stake in navigation mixte 's insurance interests acquired three weeks ago 
 those include <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and via assurances 
 long considered a potential takeover target navigation mixte had hoped allianz would help protect it from raiders 
 that idea may have <unk> 
 paribas is allianz 's main french bank and the <unk> group said it intends to stay neutral 
 navigation mixte said it would n't have any comment until its board meets wednesday 
 but navigation mixte is <unk> held and hard to defend 
 the defensive options are limited says <unk> <unk> a partner in portfolio management concern france finance <unk> 
 who would bid against paribas 
 if the paribas bid succeeds it will be the second time in two months a big french investment banking group has snapped up an insurance group 
 last month paribas 's archrival cie financiere de suez won a battle for <unk> <unk> france 's second-largest private-sector insurer which itself had just acquired west germany 's <unk> <unk> ag 
 that complex bid was billed as france 's largest takeover ever this one is slightly smaller 
 moreover suez had just finished winning an even larger battle last year for control of societe generale de <unk> 
 paribas officials once considered france 's <unk> bankers felt <unk> at suez 's success and its rapid growth 
 although paribas denies it analysts say the new bid in part simply reflects the continuing <unk> between france 's two largest investment banking groups 
 it also reflects the broader pressure on companies in europe to keep up as the european community prepares to reduce internal trade barriers by N 
 although paribas chairman <unk> <unk> would n't rule out eventually selling all of navigation mixte 's insurance operations to allianz he stressed the potential for the two groups instead to cooperate 
 he also told reporters the acquisition would give paribas fresh diversity bringing it properties in food and transport where it has been weak 
 navigation mixte has investments in a sugar company a food and <unk> concern a <unk> and bus and trucking firms among others 
 and navigation mixte has a huge hidden attraction 
 payment by allianz for the insurance interests it has just bought will help swell the french concern 's treasury to an estimated N billion francs 
 paribas said it will bid N francs a share for navigation mixte shares that qualify for a full yearly dividend and N francs for those created july N which are eligible for partial dividends 
 alternatively it said it would offer three paribas shares themselves eligible for dividends as of next jan. N for one navigation mixte share 
 paribas shares closed down N francs at N francs and navigation mixte shares were suspended at N francs pending the outcome of the bid 
 paribas said it would publish details of its bid once authorities clear it 
 this is one of the first bids under new takeover rules aimed at encouraging open bids instead of gradual accumulation of large stakes 
 some financial sources said privately that paribas <unk> in failing to move sooner for the insurance and industrial group bidding only after speculation had pushed up the price 
 mr. <unk> responded that his group initially intended to take only a minority stake striking an alliance with current management 
 when <unk> <unk> navigation mixte chairman marc fournier rejected paribas 's offer and began buying paribas shares in <unk> mr. <unk> said he felt obliged to bid for control 
 he told reporters he had information that mr. fournier was preparing to buy as much as N N of paribas up from less than N N currently 
 a bid against paribas could n't be ruled out 
 france 's second-largest government-owned insurance company assurances <unk> de france has been building its own navigation mixte stake currently thought to be between N N and N N 
 analysts said they do n't think it is contemplating a takeover however and its officials could n't be reached 
 crude oil futures prices fell further as analysts and traders said opec oil producers are n't putting the <unk> on output ahead of the traditionally weak first quarter 
 in trading on the new york mercantile exchange the u.s. benchmark west texas intermediate crude fell N cents a barrel to $ N for december delivery 
 petroleum products prices also declined 
 analysts pointed to reports that the organization of petroleum exporting countries is producing substantially more than its official limit of N million barrels a day with some accounts putting the <unk> group 's output as high as N million barrels a day 
 that level of production did n't take its toll on futures prices for the fourth quarter when demand is traditionally strong 
 but because first-quarter demand is normally the weakest of the year several market participants say opec production will have to decline to keep prices from eroding further 
 the group plans to meet in a month to discuss production strategy for early N 
 with prices already headed lower news of a series of explosions at a major phillips petroleum co. chemical facility on the houston ship channel also was bearish for prices 
 even though such facilities use a relatively small amount of crude analysts say now the facility wo n't need any at a time of already high availability 
 the phillips plant makes polyethylene <unk> and other plastic products 
 a company official said the explosions began when a seal <unk> out 
 dozens of workers were injured authorities said 
 there was no immediate estimate of damage from the company 
 some petroleum futures traders say technical considerations now will help to put downward pressure on futures prices 
 for instance one trader said that prices inevitably will go lower now that they 've fallen below $ N a barrel 
 our <unk> is a little bearish now that we 've taken out $ N he said 
 in other commodity markets yesterday 
 copper 
 the selling that started on friday continued yesterday 
 the december contract fell N cents a pound to $ N 
 london metal exchange warehouse stocks were down only N metric tons for the week to N tons expectations late last week were a drop of N to N tons 
 the new york market made its high for the day on the opening and when it dropped below the $ <unk> level selling picked up as previous buyers <unk> out of their positions and aggressive short sellers anticipating further declines moved in 
 fund selling also picked up at that point 
 according to bernard savaiko senior commodity analyst at painewebber the only stability to the market came when short sellers <unk> moved in to cover their positions by buying contracts 
 this activity produced small rallies which in turn attracted new short selling 
 mr. savaiko noted that copper had a steep fall in spite of a weak dollar which would normally support the u.s. copper market 
 such support usually comes from arbitragers who use a strong british pound to buy copper in new york 
 the sell-off would probably have been worse if the dollar had been strong he said 
 copper has been stuck in a trading range of $ N to $ N 
 mr. savaiko believes that if copper falls below the bottom of this range the next significant support level will be about $ N 
 precious metals

 but <unk> <unk> a sugar analyst with <unk> <unk> international ltd. said the explanation for the latest drop in sugar prices is much simpler speculators he said got too long too soon and ran into resistance around the old contract highs

 manville having rid itself of asbestos now sells <unk> forest products minerals and industrial goods 
 <unk> stuff it 's not 
 but manville 's ownership is unusual and it has caught the eye of some <unk> and patient investors 
 the <unk> concern which emerged from bankruptcy-law proceedings late last year is controlled by the manville personal injury settlement trust 
 the trust which owns N N of manville 's stock on a fully diluted basis is a separate legal entity that is settling claims with asbestos victims 
 when and if the trust runs out of cash which seems increasingly likely it will need to convert its manville stock to cash 
 but as an N N owner if it tried to sell much of its stock in the market it would likely depress the price of its shares 
 some investors say there is a good chance that the trust will instead seek to convert the company 's shares to cash in some sort of friendly restructuring that would n't involve just <unk> stock on the market 
 their principal asset is manville common stock says jeffrey <unk> who runs <unk> associates an investment fund that owns manville shares 
 if they tried to sell they 'd be chasing their own <unk> 
 what makes the most sense is to find someone who wants to buy the whole company or cause a recapitalization of all shares 
 the trust is n't commenting on when it might need to <unk> its manville stock 
 however the trust 's cash flow from investments is far short of its payments to asbestos victims 
 its cash and liquid securities fell by $ N million in the first six months of N 
 the trust also will receive $ N million a year starting in N on a bond it holds from manville 
 and beginning in N it will have a claim on as much as N N of manville 's annual net income 
 even so the trust would seem to be facing a cash crunch 
 as of june N it had settled only about N of the N received claims from asbestos victims for an average of $ N each 
 the average should drop over time since the most expensive claims are being settled first 
 and as of midyear settled but unpaid claims amounted to $ N million more than half the trust 's total of $ N million in cash and <unk> securities 
 at some point we 're going to need an <unk> of funds a person close to the trust says 
 even before then the trust may be eager to unload manville stock 
 it does n't pay a dividend and this trust needs income 
 moreover with N N of its assets tied up in manville the trust is badly in need of diversification 
 obviously a diversified portfolio would have less risk the person close to the trust says 
 manville itself does n't rule out a restructuring 
 though the ink is barely dry on its new <unk> law structure bill bullock manville 's head of investor relations says the company is continually <unk> whether there is a better way to be structured 
 we understand that the trust is ultimately going to need to sell some of our shares he says 
 of course one option would be for manville to buy out the trust 's shares which would do little to benefit public stockholders 
 but the trust in most cases is <unk> from seeking a buyer for only its shares before november N 
 and both the trust and manville are seeking to avoid the bad publicity that in the asbestos era <unk> the manville name 
 thus analysts say the trust is unlikely to do anything that would hurt manville 's other shareholders 
 this is a rare case of a company with a big majority holder which will probably act in the interests of the minority holders one investor says 
 even if there is no restructuring manville seems to be attractive long-term 
 its stock at N N trades at about N N times estimated N earnings an <unk> low multiple for a company with <unk> customers 
 mr. bullock says N N of revenues are tied to construction 
 analysts predict little or no near-term growth 
 they are nonetheless high on manville 's management 
 it 's one of the best in the business says salomon brothers analyst stephen <unk> 
 and he says manville has the financial flexibility to buy other companies at the best possible moment when other <unk> firms are hurting and selling cheap 
 with a conservative <unk> ratio of <unk> and $ N million in cash manville is indeed actively on the <unk> 
 so far as a <unk> <unk> manville has n't bought much 
 paul <unk> an analyst at duff & phelps says even though they have borrowing power they have been disciplined about acquisitions 
 and mr. <unk> says that with N N of its stock in friendly hands manville is the rare publicly traded company that can ignore short-term stock fluctuations and plan for the long haul

 santa fe pacific corp. is preparing a plan to sell a N N stake in its large real estate unit to a california public employee pension fund for $ N million after which it would spin off the realty operation to shareholders 
 the plan places an indicated value on the real estate operation santa fe pacific realty corp. of $ N billion 
 santa fe pacific directors are expected to review the plan at a meeting today according to people familiar with the transaction 
 if approved the sale is expected to close by year 's end with the spinoff <unk> by the end of N 
 in composite trading on the new york stock exchange yesterday santa fe pacific closed at $ N down N cents 
 santa fe pacific realty is a major california land and building owner whose prime properties include N undeveloped acres in the san francisco bay area and several office sites 
 a spokesman said the properties survived without significant damage in last week 's northern california earthquake 
 as a result of the partial sale and spinoff the $ N billion california public employees retirement system would obtain two seats on the board of the real estate operation according to officials of the fund who described the plan 
 a spokesman for chicago-based santa fe pacific confirmed that negotiations were being held with the fund 
 also holding two seats each on the board they said would be olympia & york developments ltd. controlled by the <unk> family of canada and itel corp. controlled by chicago businessman sam <unk> 
 the <unk> and mr. <unk> the largest holders of santa fe pacific stock have been looking for ways to raise the value of their investments including possible <unk> 
 itel bought a N N stake in <unk> fe pacific last year and olympia & york later purchased about a N N stake they would have interests in the new realty company in line with their holdings in <unk> fe pacific 
 the sale and spinoff of the real estate unit is the first phase of what could lead to the breakup of santa fe pacific into <unk> companies for its railroad and energy operations as well as real estate 
 the <unk> parent has been under pressure from large shareholders to boost the company 's share price 
 at the same time it has been caught in an earnings squeeze 
 the california pension fund 's planned investment in the real estate unit is unusual 
 pension funds rarely own as much as a N N stake in what is expected to be a publicly traded company 
 in addition pension funds are rarely given seats on company boards and most often try to avoid them because of legal concerns 
 but fund officials said the santa fe pacific realty investment provides an opportunity to buy a stake in a large real estate portfolio heavily weighted with california properties 
 it also marks a major commitment to real estate development which we have n't been involved with before said dale hanson the fund 's executive director 
 under the proposed plan the fund would also lend santa fe pacific realty $ N million in the form of a note that would be convertible into additional shares of the realty company after the second year at the <unk> market price 
 the note would <unk> interest at the rate of N N a year which would be payable to the fund after five years according to stephen e. <unk> a real estate consultant working for the fund 
 the purpose of the note is to provide added capital for the <unk> company in a form that will save it spending cash on immediate interest payments mr. <unk> said 
 the <unk> concern clearly will be one of the dominant real estate development companies with a prime portfolio he said 
 for the last year santa fe pacific has <unk> its real estate operations toward longer-term development of its properties hurting profits that the parent had generated in the past from periodic sales from its portfolio 
 real estate operating income for the first nine months fell to $ N million from $ N million a year earlier the company said 
 in a statement late yesterday santa fe pacific 's chairman robert d. <unk> said that santa fe pacific realty would repay more than $ N million in debt owed to the parent before the planned spinoff 
 that would help reduce santa fe pacific 's remaining debt to about $ N million from a high of $ N billion in early N 
 it was n't clear where santa fe pacific expected to obtain the payment of more than $ N million which would be well above the $ N million that california pension fund officials say they plan to provide 
 the realty unit might take on new debt or obtain additional investors among other possibilities 
 the santa fe pacific spokesman declined to comment on that aspect saying the deal was still under negotiation 
 santa fe pacific realty owns N million acres of property including N buildings with more than N million square feet of space 
 it also holds nearly N acres of raw land with development potential but under a previously announced strategy the company has targeted building on N acres in california arizona and the chicago area 
 among those are the N acres in the san francisco bay area including N acres in the mission bay area 
 the california pension fund which has $ N billion already invested in real estate and mortgages could be a valuable funding source for that development although it is n't obliged to make further investments 
 the fund is the nation 's largest public employee fund and it has a growing cash flow now <unk> $ N billion a year 
 fund officials negotiated the final structure of the proposed deal with santa fe pacific but they were approached with the idea by real estate brokers <unk> realty corp. of chicago 
 <unk> officials are expected to be hired to represent the pension fund on the santa fe pacific realty board mr. <unk> said to <unk> the fund from potential liability problems 
 gaf part iii is scheduled to begin today

 in an <unk> indictment the government charged gaf a wayne n.j. chemical maker and mr. sherwin with illegally attempting to manipulate the common stock of union carbide corp. in advance of gaf 's planned sale of a large block of the stock in N 
 the government 's credibility in the gaf case depended heavily on its star witness boyd l. jefferies the former los angeles brokerage chief who was <unk> by former <unk> ivan boesky and then pointed the finger at mr. sherwin takeover <unk> <unk> b. lewis and corporate raider paul <unk> 
 the gaf trials were viewed as <unk> of the government 's strength in its cases against mr. lewis and mr. <unk> 
 mr. jefferies 's performance as a witness was expected to affect his sentencing 
 but gaf 's bellwether role was short-lived 
 the first gaf trial ended in a <unk> after four weeks when u.s. district judge mary johnson lowe found that a prosecutor improperly but <unk> withheld a document 
 after N hours of <unk> the jurors in the second trial said they were <unk> <unk> and another <unk> was declared on march N 
 meanwhile a federal jury found mr. <unk> guilty on securities fraud and other charges in june 
 a month later mr. jefferies was <unk> a jail term by a federal judge who praised him for helping the government 
 in august mr. lewis pleaded guilty to three felony counts 
 nevertheless the stakes are still high for the players directly involved in the gaf case 
 the <unk> have left the <unk> of gaf mr. sherwin and gaf chairman samuel <unk> in limbo 
 for mr. sherwin a conviction could carry penalties of five years in prison and a $ N fine on each count 
 gaf faces potential fines of $ N for each count 
 individuals familiar with the case said that throughout september defense attorneys were talking with the government in an effort to prevent a trial but by the end of the month the talks had ended 
 there is much speculation among attorneys not involved that the strategy of gaf 's attorney arthur <unk> and mr. sherwin 's counsel stephen <unk> will include testimony by mr. sherwin or mr. <unk> 
 neither testified at the previous trials 
 for now defense attorneys are <unk> about their plans 
 max <unk> another gaf defense attorney said yesterday as we go in for the third time <unk> <unk> 's famous line is apt it 's <unk> <unk> all over again 
 dalkon shield claimants hope to stop <unk> appeal 
 attorneys for more than N women who claim injuries from the dalkon shield contraceptive device have asked the u.s. supreme court to refuse to hear an appeal of the bankruptcy-law reorganization plan for <unk> robins co. which manufactured the device 
 the dispute pits two groups of claimants against each other 
 baltimore attorney michael a. <unk> and N other attorneys representing N claimants in the u.s. and abroad argue that the appeal would delay and perhaps even destroy a $ N billion settlement fund that is the centerpiece of the reorganization plan 
 the bankruptcy-court reorganization is being challenged before the supreme court by a dissident group of claimants because it places a cap on the total amount of money available to settle claims 
 it also bars future suits against robins company officials members of the robins family and robins 's former insurer aetna life & casualty co 
 the latter provision is legally unprecedented said alan b. morrison a public interest lawyer in washington d.c. who is challenging the plan on behalf of N claimants 
 more than N claims against robins are pending 
 the company made and marketed the dalkon shield in the early 1970s amid mounting evidence that it could cause serious injuries 
 robins has been in proceedings under chapter N of the u.s. bankruptcy code since august N such proceedings give it protection from creditor lawsuits while it works out a plan for paying its debts 
 american home products corp. wants to acquire robins but only if all legal challenges to the plan are exhausted 
 in a brief filed with the supreme court last week mr. <unk> <unk> the appeal for raising <unk> and theoretical legal issues while <unk> the proposed reorganization and the settlement payments to claimants 
 the supreme court is scheduled to consider the case nov. N and may issue a decision as early as nov. N 
 jury 's criminal conviction under superfund law is a first 
 charles a. <unk> sole <unk> of a louisville ky. <unk> company was found guilty of violating the superfund law as well as the clean air act 
 criminal convictions under the federal superfund law are rare and the decision is the first jury verdict in such a case 
 under superfund those who owned generated or <unk> hazardous waste are liable for its cleanup regardless of whether their actions were legal at the time 
 environmental lawyers say virtually all of the superfund cases to date have involved civil penalties designed to insure cleanup of past <unk> activities 
 but superfund also contains a criminal provision concerning the release of toxic <unk> into the environment 
 in N congress strengthened the penalty by making it a felony 
 mr. <unk> was convicted in louisville late last month of violating superfund by failing to report the release of asbestos into the environment from a building he was <unk> 
 he was also convicted of failing to properly remove asbestos from the building a violation of the clean air act 
 the government sought a criminal penalty because no cleanup is possible here 
 once asbestos is released into the environment it can <unk> anywhere says richard a. dennis the assistant u.s. attorney who prosecuted the case 
 mr. <unk> is scheduled to be sentenced dec. N 
 his lawyer could not be reached for comment 
 mr. <unk> faces as much as three years in prison and a $ N fine for the superfund conviction and as much as one year in prison and a $ N fine for the violation of the clean air act 
 ted <unk> lawyers switch to victims ' side in <unk> case 
 <unk> cutler & <unk> the washington d.c. law firm that spent over $ N million fighting the execution of <unk> ted <unk> who eventually was executed has taken on another death penalty case before the supreme court this time on the side of the family of four murder victims in arkansas 
 the law firm has filed a <unk> brief jointly with the washington legal foundation a conservative legal group 
 the key issue in the case which the law firm is handling without a fee or pro bono is whether a person sentenced to death can voluntarily waive his rights of appellate review 
 the <unk> ronald gene simmons was convicted of killing N people 
 another <unk> on death row has appealed mr. simmons 's death sentence in a next friend capacity 
 <unk> cutler 's brief argues that there is no mandatory appellate review of capital sentences and that the <unk> who filed the appeal lacks proper standing 
 <unk> mode <unk> cutler 's managing partner says the trial team that represented mr. <unk> was asked by the firm 's pro bono committee whether the new case posed a conflict and that no objections were raised 
 the <unk> of the law firm and the washington legal foundation is odd also because <unk> cutler was one of the firms singled out for criticism two years ago by the conservative legal group for <unk> a liberal bias in its pro bono work 
 we give them a lot of credit for taking this case says <unk> 's alan <unk>

 integrated will pump $ N million to $ N million into royal alliance as initial funding 
 in an interview mr. <unk> said that based on criteria yet to be determined he expects to distribute N N of royal alliance to the representatives who sell integrated 's insurance and mutual-fund products 
 if integrated <unk> royal alliance the representatives will retain their N N ownership 
 mr. <unk> indicated that completion of the transaction could take several weeks and it was n't immediately clear what would happen to the broker-dealer subsidiary if integrated files for bankruptcy-law protection in the meantime 
 the subsidiary is n't expected to be profitable for at least one year 
 if integrated <unk> the unit it would receive any profit the unit reports even while the unit is independent
