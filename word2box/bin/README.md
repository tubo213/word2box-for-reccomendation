## Language Modeling with Boxes Bin
This directory contains all executable files. Ideally, we should not have any long scripts here, they should just be shims to the actual code which is in the `src` directory. With the default setup, you should not need to add any additional files to this directory, simply make them subcommands of the primary package.
